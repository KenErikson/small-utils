The Handmaid's Tale...</font>

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:03,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was your trip?</font>

3
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in Mexico to coordinate
a trade delegation.</font>

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:07,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something wrong?</font>

5
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to worry
about this.</font>

6
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got good men
working on it.</font>

7
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,044
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't you ever touch me like
that, when she's there.</i></font>

8
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:16,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mind it.
I don't think you did either.</font>

9
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your time is running out here.</font>

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was thinking maybe
we could try another way.</i></font>

11
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I couldn't say no when
Mrs. Waterford asked me.</i></font>

12
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

to make the world better.</i></font>

14
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,071
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now you have respect.</i></font>

15
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You can fulfill your
biological destinies in peace.</i></font>

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biological destiny?</font>

17
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children. What else
is there to live for?</font>

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,591
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Love.</i></font>

19
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,483
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Once.</i></font>

20
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,783
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Actually, twice for him.</i></font>

21
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:13,120
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Two times for me.</i></font>

22
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,207

00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,212

24
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It doesn't matter.</i></font>

25
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:28,652
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It can never happen again.</i></font>

26
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,198
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sorry, Nick.</i></font>

27
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:46,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spick and span, girls.
He loves us for our labors!</font>

28
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do we have to do this?</font>

29
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:51,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fun.</font>

30
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:55,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's like painting.</font>

31
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just want everything
to look pretty and perfect.</font>

32
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people visiting.</font>

33
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:04,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foreigners.</font>

34
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:07,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tourists?</font>

35
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's kind of messed up.</font>

36
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:11,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, like government people,</font>

37
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">diplomats.</font>

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be at
your house tonight.</font>

39
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

40
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:20,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Commander.</font>

41
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small dick, big mouth.</font>

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks kind of weird without
all the dead bodies, doesn't it?</font>

43
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:39,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

44
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you get used
to things being one way.</font>

45
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up in there.</font>

46
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:45,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming.</font>

47
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:49,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left a clean dress for you.</font>

48
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as you're dressed, Mrs.
Waterford wants to see you.</font>

50
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:57,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">In her room.</font>

51
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

52
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:05,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll keep a good thought.</font>

53
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Waterford?</font>

54
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">All cleaned up?</font>

55
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:05,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Mrs. Waterford.</font>

56
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

57
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we have some
important guests tonight,</font>

58
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:13,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">a trade delegation from Mexico.</font>

59
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Commander worked very hard
to arrange this visit.</font>

60
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to make
the right impression.</font>

61
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's see you.</font>

62
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

63
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:34,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fine. Thank you.</font>

64
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:36,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red's my color.</font>

65
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's lucky.</font>

66
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:49,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our visitors may have
some questions.</font>

67
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're curious about
our lives here.</font>

68
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:55,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that if spoken to,
you'll speak wisely.</font>

69
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:56,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try to</font>

70
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">speak wisely, Mrs. Waterford.</font>

71
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't disappoint me.</font>

72
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.</font>

73
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go.</font>

74
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:47,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You took your time.
- It's a good day for us.</font>

75
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left as early as I could.</font>

76
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good, 'cause I have
a conference call at 4:00.</font>

77
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...
Wait, wait, wait.</font>

78
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:55,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your boy toy.
I need to be romanced.</font>

79
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us pray.</font>

80
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe some flowers.</font>

81
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could write me a poem.</font>

82
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:00,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't have to rhyme.</font>

83
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Lord God caused a
deep sleep to fall upon Adam,</font>

84
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he took one of his ribs, and
closed up the flesh instead thereof.</font>

85
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. I like that skirt.
Focus, focus.</font>

86
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:12,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the rib, which the Lord
God had taken from man,</font>

87
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">made he a woman,
and brought her unto the man.</font>

88
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:19,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">My bones, flesh of my flesh, she shall
be called Woman, because she was...</font>

89
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore, shall a man...</font>

90
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unto his wife.</font>

91
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were naked,
the man and the wife,</font>

92
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they were not ashamed.</font>

93
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">May God bless this union...</font>

94
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make it fruitful.</font>

95
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:36,218
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Amen.</i></font>

96
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're through security.
Should be here any minute.</font>

97
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look very handsome.</font>

98
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

99
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're having dinner at the home
of a very powerful Commander.</font>

100
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:11,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them be nervous.</font>

101
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed be the fruit.</font>

102
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord open.</font>

103
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:57,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your day going?</font>

104
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look pretty.</font>

105
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

106
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wore it just for you.</font>

107
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't wear
anything for me.</font>

108
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick? Bring her in.</font>

109
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:23,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputy Ambassador Castillo, <i>puedo
presentar</i> our Handmaid, Offred.</font>

110
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord open.</font>

111
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:32,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Mrs. Castillo
is the Ambassador.</font>

112
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Flores is her assistant.</font>

113
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

114
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No apologies are necessary.</font>

115
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:41,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a pleasure to meet you.</font>

116
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:42,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord open.</font>

117
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've heard a bit
about Handmaids,</font>

118
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:50,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's difficult to
separate rumors from facts.</font>

119
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is why I'm so pleased we're opening
a dialog between our countries.</font>

120
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:56,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred, what is your given name?</font>

121
00:10:57,998 --> 00:10:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">From before.</font>

122
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:02,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't use that anymore.</font>

123
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:06,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Handmaids take patronymics, derived
from the head of their household.</font>

124
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ofwarren, Offred, et cetera.</font>

125
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a symbol of their
sacred position.</font>

126
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I would like to know more
about your sacred position.</font>

127
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you choose to be a Handmaid?</font>

128
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:27,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

129
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well.</font>

130
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:34,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an enormous sacrifice,
what you're doing.</font>

131
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Handmaids are having children
for the entire nation.</font>

132
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred knows how grateful
we are for her choice in this.</font>

133
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

134
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

135
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:49,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon the interruption.</font>

136
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambassador, gentlemen, please
join us for some hors d'oeuvres.</font>

137
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, dear.</font>

138
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we make our way, then?</font>

139
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, after you.</font>

140
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pleasure to meet you, Offred.</font>

141
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:06,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed be the fruit.</font>

142
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:07,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under His eye.</font>

143
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:13,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your time
and your thoughts.</font>

144
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

145
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might, may I ask,</font>

146
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I apologize
if this is too personal,</font>

147
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:25,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you have chosen
such a difficult life.</font>

148
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you happy?</font>

149
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:57,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have found happiness,</font>

150
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">yes.</font>

151
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very glad, Offred.</font>

152
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:10,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambassador.</font>

153
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:25,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so pleased and honored you've
traveled so far to be with us.</font>

154
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,335
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Por favor.</i></font>

155
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything looks delicious.
<i>Gracias.</i></font>

156
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:33,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've transitioned to a completely
organic agricultural model.</font>

157
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impressive.</font>

158
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is the harvest
in your country?</font>

159
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:40,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, we have challenges,
like the rest of the world.</font>

160
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of our staples are not adjusting
to the new weather patterns.</font>

161
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our citrus orchards in Florida
are doing really well.</font>

162
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rita, could you check and see
if we have any oranges?</font>

163
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

164
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:54,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we do.
Good.</font>

165
00:13:56,062 --> 00:14:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope we'll find other valuable
resources to share with you as well.</font>

166
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">God has blessed
our new nation...</font>

167
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:06,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you... In so many ways.</font>

168
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:07,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

169
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm curious.
Hmm.</font>

170
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:14,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does the quiet half of
the room feel about Gilead?</font>

171
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's absolutely wonderful.</font>

172
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Waterford?</font>

173
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:30,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am blessed to have a home and a
husband to care for and follow.</font>

174
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traditional values are at the
core of everything we do here,</font>

175
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:35,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">including trade policy.</font>

176
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:43,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Never mistake a woman's
meekness for weakness."</font>

177
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:46,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clever.</font>

178
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

179
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from <i>A Woman's Place.</i></font>

180
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife's book.</font>

181
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reread it on the plane.</font>

182
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:58,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a thoughtful argument for</font>

183
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:02,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">domestic feminism,
as it was called.</font>

184
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
That's very kind.</font>

185
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you speak
once at a rally,</font>

186
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the war,
you were very passionate.</font>

187
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women were abandoning their families
and we needed to make a change.</font>

188
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were running out of time.</font>

189
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were arrested for inciting
to riot, if I recall?</font>

190
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:21,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a temper in those days.</font>

191
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:29,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back then, did you ever
imagine a society like this?</font>

192
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:33,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">A society that has reduced its carbon
emissions by 78% in three years?</font>

193
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:36,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">A society in which women can
no longer read your book.</font>

194
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or anything else.</font>

195
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

196
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:50,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

197
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">God asks for sacrifices,
Mrs. Castillo.</font>

198
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">That has always been His way,</font>

199
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">but He gives the righteous
blessings in return.</font>

200
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:02,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think that
it's safe to say</font>

201
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:05,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilead has been blessed
in so many ways.</font>

202
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

203
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we have dinner?</font>

204
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't have
invited the wives.</font>

205
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a dinner at home.</font>

206
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider the optics.</font>

207
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't make
progress on trade,</font>

208
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:27,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">in six months our currency
will fall off a cliff.</font>

209
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider that.</font>

210
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Recounting your arrest record doesn't
do anything to help that problem.</font>

211
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have meetings tomorrow.</font>

212
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:38,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can talk about the issues, and
then we have the reception afterwards.</font>

213
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:39,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waste of time.</font>

214
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I disagree.</font>

215
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go over the details.</font>

216
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you'll make it
all look perfect.</font>

217
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

218
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

219
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look tired.</font>

220
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:13,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">We met until 3:00 a. M.</font>

221
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colby and Harris had to
take the train in.</font>

222
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're still being followed.</font>

223
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:20,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">FBI?</font>

224
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Most likely.</font>

225
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if they made it and you had
the full committee, what happened?</font>

226
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:26,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing happened because all these
men know how to do is talk.</font>

227
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I honestly don't know if they have
the faith to see this through.</font>

228
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:31,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey.</font>

229
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

230
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going out.</font>

231
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:43,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

232
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:46,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have calls to make, and
I just wanna go to sleep.</font>

233
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:47,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't asking.</font>

234
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

235
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

236
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure this is big enough?</font>

237
00:17:56,584 --> 00:18:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no problem that cannot be
solved with enough movie popcorn.</font>

238
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you make your proposal
to the committee?</font>

239
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, if it did any good.
D6 and 7.</font>

240
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you? I've barely
had a chance to talk to you.</font>

241
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:15,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you turn in your article?</font>

242
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm still working on it.</font>

243
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you know, I was thinking,</font>

244
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:23,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">fertility as a national resource,
reproduction as a moral imperative.</font>

245
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:27,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's a really interesting idea
and it could make for a great second book.</font>

246
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or not. I honestly didn't think that
I would ever write another book.</font>

247
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:35,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should.</font>

248
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great idea.</font>

249
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:43,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Okay.</font>

250
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold this.</font>

251
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

252
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening.</font>

253
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">They issued the orders.</font>

254
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what we proposed.</font>

255
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:05,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three separate attacks.</font>

256
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:07,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">When?</font>

257
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three weeks.</font>

258
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congress first, then the
White House, then the Court.</font>

259
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praise be.</font>

260
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things have to change.</font>

261
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

262
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's still going
to be a lot of pain.</font>

263
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's pain now.
So much of it.</font>

264
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:52,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're saving them.</font>

265
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doing God's work.</font>

266
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

267
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:41,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

268
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">He, uh... He wants to
see you in his office.</font>

269
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

270
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:08,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">It only makes it worse.</font>

271
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:48,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see
the way she looked at us?</font>

272
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like we were fucking freaks.</font>

273
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are they to judge us?</font>

274
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:56,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half their population
is malnourished.</font>

275
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've had four elections
in three years.</font>

276
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing
to save the planet? Hmm?</font>

277
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a single thing.</font>

278
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't they see the good work
we're doing here?</font>

279
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:12,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I boring you?</font>

280
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:18,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Sorry.</font>

281
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being in here is a privilege.</font>

282
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:26,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that.</font>

283
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:30,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to go.</font>

284
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:30,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

285
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I...</font>

286
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:39,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I stay here</font>

287
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">with you?</font>

288
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:48,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please?</font>

289
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:56,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to stay?</font>

290
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

291
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

292
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kiss me.</font>

293
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:12,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like that.</font>

294
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:18,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you mean it.</font>

295
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:43,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet girl.</font>

296
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big day tomorrow.
Get some sleep.</font>

297
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, girls.</font>

298
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:31,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we are inside,</font>

299
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">there will be
no wandering about.</font>

300
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will stay
at your own tables.</font>

301
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have tables?</font>

302
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:45,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight you are guests,
just like everyone else.</font>

303
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:49,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not an excuse
to misbehave.</font>

304
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, don't you all
look beautiful.</font>

305
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

306
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Line them up, please.</font>

307
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Aunt, if you would.</font>

308
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:05,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, girls.
One line.</font>

309
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:06,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neat as you please.</font>

310
00:27:27,432 --> 00:27:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very nice.</font>

311
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely.</font>

312
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please remove the damaged ones.</font>

313
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Waterford, ma'am.</font>

314
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever punishment these girls had
to endure was for the greater good.</font>

315
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:57,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">They deserve to be honored
just like everyone else.</font>

316
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:58,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we do honor them.</font>

317
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:03,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't put the bruised
apples at the top of the crate,</font>

318
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you?</font>

319
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:09,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

320
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quietly, please.</font>

321
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:18,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

322
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come forward. Oflyle,</font>

323
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:27,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ofthomas, Ofjohn, Oftim.</font>

324
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ofwarren, you too.
Quick-quick.</font>

325
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take them to the van.</font>

326
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:37,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

327
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I want to go to the party.</font>

328
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ofwarren.
- No!</font>

329
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!
Janine!</font>

330
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, get off of me!</font>

331
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:45,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I didn't...
Janine.</font>

332
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

333
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

334
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna go to the party.</font>

335
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ofwarren.
I know.</font>

336
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

337
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shh.
- I didn't do anything.</font>

338
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:53,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Janine.</font>

339
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:03,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not fair.</font>

340
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're absolutely right.</font>

341
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:11,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sometimes we have to do
what is best for everyone,</font>

342
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">not what is fair.</font>

343
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go with Aunt Dylan</font>

344
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:32,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will make sure you get
a whole tray of dessert.</font>

345
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:37,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promise?</font>

346
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cross my heart.</font>

347
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:41,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hope to die?</font>

348
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:46,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope to die.</font>

349
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, girls.
Two lines!</font>

350
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best behavior!</font>

351
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praised be.</font>

352
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a dream.</font>

353
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:33,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I went to
a Bat Mitzvah here once.</font>

354
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't let you speak.</font>

355
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

356
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is what it is.</font>

357
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:09,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for trying.</font>

358
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:11,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't give up trying.</font>

359
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be a part
of these decisions.</font>

360
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to keep
telling them that.</font>

361
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:19,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't. We need to work together
now, not argue amongst ourselves.</font>

362
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:28,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to see you at home.</font>

363
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're moving on to the
security discussions.</font>

364
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:53,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was she upset?
No, just frustrated.</font>

365
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been involved in this
from the very beginning.</font>

366
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:59,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is our fault.</font>

367
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gave them more
than they could handle.</font>

368
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:08,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">They put so much focus on academic
pursuits and professional ambition,</font>

369
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">we let them forget
their real purpose.</font>

370
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:13,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't let that happen again.</font>

371
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

372
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were supposed to be seated
when the Ambassador got here.</font>

373
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Patience. Even the righteous
need a little show business.</font>

374
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:06,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, everyone.</font>

375
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to welcome our guests.</font>

376
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight is a celebration
of Gilead</font>

377
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">and of what we have achieved.</font>

378
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:27,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have made great strides
cleaning the environment,</font>

379
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">and restoring a healthy
and moral way of life.</font>

380
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:35,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're very proud of what we're
leaving behind for future generations.</font>

381
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:41,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we know that
none of it matters</font>

382
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we cannot solve
our most pressing problem.</font>

383
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:48,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have finally begun
to do just that.</font>

384
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:54,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">With God's blessing, and with the
devotion of a group of girls.</font>

385
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, stand.</font>

386
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight we honor
your contribution.</font>

387
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:22,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, for our guests, we
have a very special surprise.</font>

388
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is my honor to present
to you the children of Gilead.</font>

389
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:33,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">All brought forth in this
district by our Handmaids.</font>

390
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's go and say hello
to the head table.</font>

391
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:54,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Waterford's
gonna get his trade deal.</font>

392
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did they talk
about last night?</font>

393
00:36:58,949 --> 00:36:59,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

394
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

395
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:03,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't hear anything?</font>

396
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schedules, dates?</font>

397
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:06,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you care so much?</font>

398
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:07,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you hear?</font>

399
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:12,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it matter how many
oranges we trade with Mexico?</font>

400
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think they want
to trade oranges?</font>

401
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be an idiot.</font>

402
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilead only has one thing
to trade that anyone wants.</font>

403
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:22,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red tags.</font>

404
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:30,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

405
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to trade us, dummy.</font>

406
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to trade
for Handmaids.</font>

407
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can go to the trash.</font>

408
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can come in here.</font>

409
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just by the closet.</font>

410
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:43,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">And those can go, too.
Thank you.</font>

411
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

412
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it, does it fit?</font>

413
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:10,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you look very important.</font>

414
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:13,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you heading in?</font>

415
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:16,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senior staff
meets at 10:00.</font>

416
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be coming with me.</font>

417
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:27,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what are your
plans for today?</font>

418
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:32,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to make
this place a home.</font>

419
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tired?</font>

420
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:10,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">The opposite, actually.</font>

421
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:14,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that I'll
be able to get to sleep.</font>

422
00:41:18,217 --> 00:41:20,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just glad that it went
so well. Congratulations.</font>

423
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:22,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too.</font>

424
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should discuss
with the other Commanders.</font>

425
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:33,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">See the best way
to move forward.</font>

426
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

427
00:41:36,547 --> 00:41:37,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can wait.</font>

428
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">The timing for implementation is the
most important thing right now.</font>

429
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an amazing woman.</font>

430
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot.</font>

431
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should...</font>

432
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should stop.</font>

433
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:57,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

434
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:49,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

435
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's going on?</font>

436
00:43:58,204 --> 00:43:59,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've said something.</font>

437
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've said something.
I should've...</font>

438
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:03,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've told her.</font>

439
00:44:03,715 --> 00:44:05,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've told her
what they do to us.</font>

440
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being too hard
on yourself.</font>

441
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:09,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were in a room full of Commanders.
No, I should've...</font>

442
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:10,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said I was happy.</font>

443
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said I was happy.</font>

444
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice did you have?</font>

445
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:21,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be here.
I can't be here.</font>

446
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down for a second.
I can't. No, I can't.</font>

447
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to me. Hey.</font>

448
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:26,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred.
If they find us here.</font>

449
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:27,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they find us...
Offred.</font>

450
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:30,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they find us together, I'm
gonna get sent to the colonies.</font>

451
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:31,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an Eye.</font>

452
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:32,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're untouchable.</font>

453
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:34,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...
That's not true.</font>

454
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Nick. Fuck you!</font>

455
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't rape you, do they?</font>

456
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't come in here once a month
and read you a little scripture</font>

457
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:45,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stick his cock up your ass?</font>

458
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said I was happy!</font>

459
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred.
Don't call me that!</font>

460
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not my name.</font>

461
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get you a glass of water?</font>

462
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:28,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's June.</font>

463
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:35,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name. It's June.</font>

464
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:00,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to meet you, June.</font>

465
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:23,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

466
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:25,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll let the Commander
know you're here.</font>

467
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. No rush.
We are a bit early.</font>

468
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:34,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good morning.</font>

469
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:36,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed be the fruit.</font>

470
00:46:36,353 --> 00:46:38,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be going on
one of your walks?</font>

471
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

472
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:45,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I better not keep
my partner waiting.</font>

473
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:47,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
Of course.</font>

474
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:50,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um, I just wanted
to give you a gift,</font>

475
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, to thank you
for your candor.</font>

476
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:58,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was invaluable.</font>

477
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:03,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mexican chocolates,
from my home town.</font>

478
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:10,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, for helping me
understand your world a bit.</font>

479
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:14,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under His eye.</font>

480
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:28,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't understand.</font>

481
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:36,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied to you.</font>

482
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is...</font>

483
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:44,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">A brutal place.</font>

484
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:48,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred?
We're prisoners.</font>

485
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:54,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we run,
they'll try to kill us.</font>

486
00:47:56,764 --> 00:47:57,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or worse.</font>

487
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:00,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">They beat us.</font>

488
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">They use cattle prods
to try to get us to behave.</font>

489
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:12,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're caught reading,
they'll cut off a finger.</font>

490
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second offense,
just the whole hand.</font>

491
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">They gouge out our eyes.</font>

492
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just maim us</font>

493
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">in worse ways
than you can imagine.</font>

494
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:39,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">They rape me.</font>

495
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:43,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just every month.</font>

496
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:45,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever I might be fertile.</font>

497
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm...</font>

498
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:52,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

499
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't choose this.</font>

500
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">They caught me.</font>

501
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to escape.</font>

502
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:17,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took my daughter.</font>

503
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't be sorry.</font>

504
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

505
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:34,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't be sorry.</font>

506
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:39,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please do something.</font>

507
00:49:44,186 --> 00:49:45,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

508
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't help you.</font>

509
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:09,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going
to trade us for?</font>

510
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:11,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

511
00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:14,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

512
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking chocolate?</font>

513
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:25,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're human beings.</font>

514
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you do that?</font>

515
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:33,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

516
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:36,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you do that?</font>

517
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am from Xipica,
Ms. Offred.</font>

518
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:47,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is nice city,
maybe the size of Boston.</font>

519
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">There hasn't been a child born
alive in Xipica in six years.</font>

520
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">My country is dying.</font>

521
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">My country's already dead.</font>

522
00:51:16,996 --> 00:51:18,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambassador. There you are.</font>

523
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:25,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything all right?</font>

524
00:51:30,315 --> 00:51:32,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just giving Offred
a farewell gift.</font>

525
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:36,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have one for
Mrs. Waterford as well.</font>

526
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:37,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very kind of you.</font>

527
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:39,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

528
00:51:43,509 --> 00:51:45,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Straight ahead.
To the right.</font>

529
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:03,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred?</font>

530
00:52:04,217 --> 00:52:05,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go.</font>

531
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:09,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to help you.</font>

532
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know where
your daughter is,</font>

533
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:17,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think I can get
a message to your husband.</font>

534
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:22,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband's dead.</font>

535
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:28,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucas Bankole,</font>

536
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:33,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">born 29 April, 1980, in Nyack,</font>

537
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">formerly New York State.</font>

538
00:52:45,215 --> 00:52:46,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's alive.</font>

539
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:47,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

540
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard shots.</font>

541
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:54,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have much time.</font>

542
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please...</font>

543
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">June.</font>

544
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:03,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write something.</font>

545
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try to get it to him.</font>
