00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offred, what is your
given name? From before.</font>

00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,300

Did the car go bump?</font>

25
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,969

Okay?</font>

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,706

<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh!</font>

51
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should...
Pop it, put six in.</font>

52
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop it, pull it, six bullets.</font>

53
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop it, pull it, six...
Argh.</font>

54
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop it, six in.</font>

55
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop it, pull it, six bullets...</font>

56
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

57
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

58
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.
Oh, God.</font>

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

60
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

61
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just out for breakfast.</font>

62
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not illegal.</font>

63
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

64
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">She all right?
We didn't give her too much?</font>

65
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. She's okay.</font>

66
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's okay.</font>

67
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have
left when Moira did.</font>

68
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had to wait for the visas.</font>

69
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I lost my job,
we should've left then.</font>

70
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I can't just
make the visa process</font>

71
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:08,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">move faster just
because I want it to,</font>

72
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:10,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right? I know. That's
not what I'm saying.</font>

73
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moira is crossing
the border on foot.</font>

74
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
We've got a kid.</font>

75
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that.
There's a difference.</font>

76
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying we should've
left when she did.</font>

77
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

78
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that him?</font>

79
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whitford, right?</font>

80
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess, uh, we should've set
a password or something.</font>

81
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like
your mama, little June.</font>

82
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:50,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd know you anywhere.</font>

83
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for doing
this, Mr. Whitford.</font>

84
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I owe her.</font>

85
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mama gave me the snip a few years
back after they made it illegal.</font>

86
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's no time for kids, you know?</font>

87
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">She zonked on something?
Benadryl.</font>

88
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave it to her with breakfast.</font>

89
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

90
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've got about
an hour or so.</font>

91
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your phones.</font>

92
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we turned 'em off.</font>

93
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

94
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me? They can track
these things location services or not.</font>

95
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">That backpack needs
to get going too.</font>

96
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
That's all we brought with us.</font>

97
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

98
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't look
like you're running.</font>

99
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, you know,</font>

100
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">people carry backpacks on the
street all the time,</font>

101
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, like, it doesn't necessarily
say that we're leaving.</font>

102
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna take that chance?</font>

103
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

104
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Hold on.
Hold on.</font>

105
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm... I'm taking 'em.</font>

106
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

107
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

108
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be driving.</font>

109
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You two and the rug
rat will be in the trunk.</font>

110
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? No, no.</font>

111
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't put the kid... In the trunk.
In the trunk?</font>

112
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:09,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then forget this.</font>

113
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you'll never make
it out of the county.</font>

114
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

115
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luke.</font>

116
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

117
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it. Come on.</font>

118
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she's fine.</font>

119
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Come on.</font>

120
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got her?</font>

121
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:52,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

122
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That a girl.</font>

123
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

124
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Fluffy.</font>

125
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

126
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right.</font>

127
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the Benadryl?</font>

128
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.</font>

129
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threw it out.</font>

130
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot.</font>

131
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

132
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if she wakes up?
Nah, she won't wake up.</font>

133
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?
Yeah, she's all right.</font>

134
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's all right.</font>

135
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey.
Jesus.</font>

136
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

137
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

138
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luke. Luke.
June. June.</font>

139
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">June bug?
June bug?</font>

140
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">June bug?</font>

141
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

142
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be all right.</font>

143
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, here.
Just stay here.</font>

144
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,730

147
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,670

148
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm just really cozy.</font>

149
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

150
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember</font>

151
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sublet we had
in Sommerville?</font>

152
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

153
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bigger.</font>

154
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

155
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is much bigger.</font>

156
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot bigger.</font>

157
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">All good.</font>

158
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing in here.
Thank you.</font>

159
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You good?</font>

160
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took his sister
to the prom back in the day.</font>

161
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe you, me,
he owes me a fuckin' favor.</font>

162
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't be much longer.</font>

163
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to your
little slice of heaven.</font>

164
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as this slice
of heaven has a shower.</font>

165
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got her?
Yeah. Yeah.</font>

166
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey come on, Hannah Banana.
Come on.</font>

167
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at you, you're tired.</font>

168
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how close
are the neighbors?</font>

169
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two miles. Six miles.
Three miles.</font>

170
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy?</font>

171
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look.</font>

172
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.</font>

173
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's snowing.</font>

174
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?
I'm hungry.</font>

175
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're hungry?</font>

176
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got food inside.</font>

177
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, you hear that?</font>

178
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make yourself at home.
Is there any heat?</font>

179
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a wood
burning stove</font>

180
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the corner, but it sucks.</font>

181
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd just use
the fireplace, instead.</font>

182
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, smile.</font>

183
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're safe.</font>

184
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you want to pick out
your bedroom? Yeah?</font>

185
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.
Come on.</font>

186
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what now?</font>

187
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay here.</font>

188
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's lots of patrols between
here and the border. Mmm-hmm.</font>

189
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't safe for the ladies.</font>

190
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever shot a gun?</font>

191
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm? Uh, Yeah.
Uh, yeah. In college.</font>

192
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

193
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Revolvers are pretty
straightforward.</font>

194
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thumb hits the release latch. Cylinder pops out.
Don't want it to spin.</font>

195
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit the ejector rod. Dump your brass.
Right.</font>

196
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six bullets in.</font>

197
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull that hammer back. Fire.</font>

198
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah I got it. Got it.</font>

199
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make a run to Canada
to get you some passports</font>

200
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll be back post haste.</font>

201
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. We don't need
passports. I got visas.</font>

202
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">US passport doesn't mean shit
anymore. Bud. That's over.</font>

203
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we just wait?
Yup.</font>

204
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be back.</font>

205
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we will get
you all safe and sound</font>

206
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the magical land
of the north.</font>

207
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! No, don't, don't.
No, please stop it! Please!</font>

208
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't...</font>

209
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the others?
What?</font>

210
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your unit. Where? Ahhh! No. It's not...
I'm not a Guardian.</font>

211
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a...
Stay back.</font>

212
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">A medic. There's a...
There's an ambulance</font>

213
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:31,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">crashed a few miles up the road.</font>

214
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:35,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Guardian... The Guardian died.
I just took his jacket</font>

215
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just took his jacket.</font>

216
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you in the ambulance?</font>

217
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

218
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They shot me.</font>

219
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then they took my wife
and they took my daughter.</font>

220
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to get
back to them.</font>

221
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took the jacket to stay warm.</font>

222
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to God.
I swear to God.</font>

223
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me look at that wound.</font>

224
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

225
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to bleed to death.</font>

226
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

227
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, shit.
- It's not his jacket.</font>

228
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I topped off the tank
and we got some ammo</font>

229
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there are patrols
on the highway.</font>

230
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should move on.</font>

231
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Help me with him.</font>

232
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab what you can.
We gotta go.</font>

233
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know at some point, you're gonna
have to stop collecting strays.</font>

234
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've stopped
before I found you.</font>

235
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got him?</font>

236
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got another one.
Guardians shot him.</font>

237
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear a spot.
We need to lay him down.</font>

238
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, friend.
We'll fix you up.</font>

239
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't go.</font>

240
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've already been here too long.
Come on.</font>

241
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:16,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">More. Clean it up. Rinse it.</font>

242
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dab it.</font>

243
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, okay.</font>

244
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lila, take the next town road
south for about 15 clicks. Okay.</font>

245
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's miles.
Kilometers.</font>

246
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta zig and zag
on the way to the coast.</font>

247
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck!</font>

248
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

249
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should leave you
with a nice big scar</font>

250
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can tell all
your friends about.</font>

251
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:51,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

252
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoe.
Zoe, I'm...</font>

253
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Luke.</font>

254
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Antibiotics.</font>

255
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wound was full of crap.</font>

256
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta stay on this
drip until we reach Canada</font>

257
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you're gonna go septic.</font>

258
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no.
I need... I need to get out...</font>

259
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are Guardians all over.</font>

260
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get some
miles on them.</font>

261
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need meds and rest.
Then we can talk.</font>

262
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:15,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arm out.</font>

263
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a fist.</font>

264
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.
All good.</font>

265
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you guys?</font>

266
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got an Army brat,
two strays, a gay, and a nun.</font>

267
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about the fucks.</font>

268
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, God has bigger things
on his plate these days.</font>

269
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christine. Lila. Peter.
Hey.</font>

270
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's her name?</font>

271
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">She hasn't said anything
since we picked her up.</font>

272
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, try and get some rest.</font>

273
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,019
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hey do you want blueberries?</i></font>

274
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, chocolate chips.</font>

275
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">For breakfast?
Daddy does it.</font>

276
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he? Okay.</font>

277
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:32,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here. Wanna help me stir?
Yeah.</font>

278
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do this part. Ready?
- Yes.</font>

279
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops. All right.
That's good.</font>

280
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that good? Are you sure?
Yeah.</font>

281
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You sure you
don't want more?</font>

282
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I want more.</font>

283
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's fine. Ooh!
Look at that method.</font>

284
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very nice, I wonder
who taught you that?</font>

285
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody taught me it. I just...</font>

286
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just came up with it?</font>

287
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Interesting.</font>

288
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm watching you.</font>

289
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all right.
He's not looking.</font>

290
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chips.</font>

291
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on there?
Nothing.</font>

292
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind your own business.</font>

293
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's going on.</font>

294
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.
Nothing.</font>

295
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing? Huh?</font>

296
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Open your mouth.</font>

297
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.
Lemme see your tongue.</font>

298
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're out of syrup again.
- Huh?</font>

299
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're out of syrup again.</font>

300
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 'cause you have pancakes every day.
I'm trying to set a record.</font>

301
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going very well...
What kind of...</font>

302
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wanna do this part?
- Yeah.</font>

303
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:35,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on.</font>

304
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
I'll hold it right here.</font>

305
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna get it.
Okay. Okay. You do it.</font>

306
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna... This is going
to be my pancake.</font>

307
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, this is your pancake.</font>

308
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is going to be pancake-y.</font>

309
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

310
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so chocolatey.</font>

311
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is going to be all mine.</font>

312
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,839
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We have to talk
to Daddy about that later.</i></font>

313
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're safe here.</font>

314
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. I'm here.</font>

315
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What set her off?
- I don't know.</font>

316
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

317
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:21,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

318
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.</font>

319
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoe was, uh, stationed
at a base in South Carolina.</font>

320
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:29,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

321
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:34,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of her group heard rumors
about some, um, training centers.</font>

322
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Training...
Training for what?</font>

323
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">After DC fell, they pulled
together a bootleg raid.</font>

324
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some high school in Rockdale.</font>

325
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found her and, like,
50 other women hidden inside.</font>

326
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their kids had been taken away.</font>

327
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoe, uh, got her out.</font>

328
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was the only one.</font>

329
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those guards at the school were
not gonna let those women go.</font>

330
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think, they were,</font>

331
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, looking for fertile women.</font>

332
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gathering them up.</font>

333
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're a pro,
you're a pro. All right?</font>

334
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy's showing off now.</font>

335
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the ice or bust, huh?</font>

336
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he goes.</font>

337
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, ooh. Oh.
Oh. Come on.</font>

338
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it to the ice.</font>

339
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ice. Ice. Ice.
Ice? Ice?</font>

340
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to take the ice?</font>

341
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Come on.</font>

342
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:42,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two in a row.</font>

343
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

344
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blaze.</font>

345
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey.</font>

346
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that.
He's friendly.</font>

347
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:55,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.
Hey. Sit.</font>

348
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't expecting to see
anybody out here.</font>

349
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's...</font>

350
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quiet out here, huh?</font>

351
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi there, I'm Joe.</font>

352
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:09,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you.</font>

353
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty cold out, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.</font>

354
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is. We should probably
get inside, huh?</font>

355
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Look at you. You're all cold.
We better get you in.</font>

356
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said, "shit." I did
say "shit." Yeah, I did.</font>

357
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you in some
trouble, there.</font>

358
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that.</font>

359
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you folks stay warm.</font>

360
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blaze, let's go. Let's go home.
Come on, let's go.</font>

361
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:31,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You folks have a good day.</font>

362
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

363
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've gotta go.</font>

364
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, honey.
Come on. Careful.</font>

365
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we heading north?</font>

366
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:08,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where Canada is.</font>

367
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. No, no. I've gotta...
I've gotta get out.</font>

368
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta...</font>

369
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta head back to Boston.</font>

370
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were shot. There are
soldiers everywhere...</font>

371
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I just... Stop...</font>

372
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the bus.</font>

373
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get caught
before you hit Massachusetts.</font>

374
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the fucking bus, now.</font>

375
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting out here.</font>

376
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not getting out.
I'm getting out...</font>

377
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not stopping.
Sit down.</font>

378
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it.</font>

379
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to the coast.</font>

380
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can maybe grab a scoot
boat down to Marblehead.</font>

381
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

382
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car is warming up.
Where is she?</font>

383
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the bathroom.
Just one last try.</font>

384
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

385
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whitford gave me a gun.
It's just in case. Okay?</font>

386
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Do you know
how to use it?</font>

387
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, a little.
I know how to load it.</font>

388
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we need to be ready, all right, June?
It's just in case.</font>

389
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then show me how to load it.</font>

390
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. All right. Take
a bullet outta there.</font>

391
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

392
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:16,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">This pops open here.</font>

393
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you put six in here.</font>

394
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You close it.</font>

395
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull the hammer back
and then it fires. Careful.</font>

396
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. So just open it here...
Yeah.</font>

397
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close it...
Shh, shh, shh.</font>

398
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

399
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold up.</font>

400
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:32,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a friend.</font>

401
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move.
Don't move.</font>

402
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy. Easy.</font>

403
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are from Boston.
I heard it on my scanner.</font>

404
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're looking for you.</font>

405
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, we're leaving now
anyway. So, thanks.</font>

406
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they know your car. You
gotta stay off the main road.</font>

407
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we wait for Whitford here?
I don't know.</font>

408
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:53,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no sense in that.
He's dead.</font>

409
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">They caught him. They hung him
up on a street lamp in town.</font>

410
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a strange guy.
I liked him.</font>

411
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, could you put
the gun down?</font>

412
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.
It's all right.</font>

413
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, they're
patrolling all over.</font>

414
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can take Campbell
Pond Road as far as it goes.</font>

415
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I called a friend, so if you
guys can make it past Jackman,</font>

416
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's gonna meet you
at the border.</font>

417
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:21,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Thank you.</font>

418
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">No worries.</font>

419
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is pretty fucked up.</font>

420
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:00,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

421
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord guide your steps</font>

422
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring you to your June
and your Hannah.</font>

423
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has not forgotten any of you.</font>

424
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

425
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're ever in Boston,
you'll look me up?</font>

426
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:39,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it.</font>

427
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, I got...
You sure?</font>

428
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be able to get
a ride out of Cutler.</font>

429
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 10 miles south.</font>

430
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

431
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

432
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boat leaves soon as it's dark.</font>

433
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our dock is a half mile
down river,</font>

434
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you change your mind.</font>

435
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you something.</font>

436
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The town fought back.</font>

437
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tried to hide
the fertile women in here.</font>

438
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Guardians took them
and strung everyone else up.</font>

439
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one of these
in every town.</font>

440
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what they do
to people who fight back.</font>

441
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only thing I can do.</font>

442
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">The US government
has people in Canada.</font>

443
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can help you find them,
maybe even get them out.</font>

444
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

445
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not...</font>

446
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you go back,</font>

447
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna die.</font>

448
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna die and leave
them all on their own.</font>

449
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you want?</font>

450
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't...
I don't...</font>

451
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:45,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's coming.</font>

452
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart.</font>

453
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasted a whole prayer on you.</font>

454
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of my good ones.</font>

455
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

456
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We heard Gilead's starting
to patrol with drones.</font>

457
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be fast,</font>

458
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">just straight up the coast
to New Brunswick.</font>

459
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
All aboard.</font>

460
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

461
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You paid for five, not six.</font>

462
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's not coming?</font>

463
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all coming.
We're all coming.</font>

464
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

465
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how this works.</font>

466
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

467
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is morphine.</font>

468
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Percocet.</font>

469
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?
It's a good start.</font>

470
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else you got in there?
Don't be a motherfucker.</font>

471
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! It's all right.
It's all right.</font>

472
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">This a free enterprise.</font>

473
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll do.</font>

474
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go!</font>

475
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:55,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move, let's move.
Stow it all away.</font>

476
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.
It's all right.</font>

477
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab that line.</font>

478
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'm gonna help
you down.</font>

479
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Come on. Let's
get outta here!</font>

480
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

481
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move.</font>

482
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

483
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

484
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:15,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down!</font>

485
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down.
It's all right.</font>

486
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

487
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down.</font>

488
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down.</font>

489
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

490
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

491
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's tea.</font>

492
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd run outta coffee.</font>

493
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, hey.</font>

494
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not in charge of rationing.</font>

495
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

496
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice out, right?</font>

497
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got the power back on
in the apartment.</font>

498
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things...
Hey, no, no, no.</font>

499
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean you get to go
back to sitting inside all day.</font>

500
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, seriously. No.</font>

501
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

502
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is nice, right?</font>

503
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,699
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello, Mr. Bankole?</i></font>

504
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah. Hello?</font>

505
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- We know your meeting with
- Ms. Tapping is next week.</i></font>

506
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,019
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But we were hoping
you could come in today?</i></font>

507
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luke Bankole?</font>

508
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah. Um...</font>

509
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Tapping?</font>

510
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Rachel, please.</font>

511
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ava, could you get us
some coffee?</font>

512
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, come in.</font>

513
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so, um...
I think that you're looking...</font>

514
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you...
Thank you so much for...</font>

515
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">For seeing me.
I really appreciate it.</font>

516
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I think, uh, you're probably
looking for high schools.</font>

517
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:52,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, if I was trying to hide
a couple of hundred people,</font>

518
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I don't think that...</font>

519
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luke.</font>

520
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
a woman named June Osborn?</font>

521
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's 31, blonde hair,
blue eyes, from Boston?</font>

522
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my wife.</font>

523
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:11,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we thought.</font>

524
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:16,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is for you.</font>

525
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get this?</font>

526
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of our contacts
in the Mexican government.</font>

527
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:48,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">From one
of their trade delegates.</font>

528
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:51,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry it's not more.</font>

529
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they only had
a few seconds.</font>

530
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">When?</font>

531
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:58,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three weeks ago.</font>

532
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, she's alive?</font>

533
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe so, yes.</font>

534
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry... Sorry.
Can I have a moment?</font>

535
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

536
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course.</font>

537
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:16,239
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I love you</i></font>

538
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:20,719
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so much.</i></font>

539
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:24,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Save Hannah.</i></font>
