Doesn't...?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she looked really good.</font>

67
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,099

at a table with the cool kids.</font>

68
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">That seemed pathetic and mean.</font>

69
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:15,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it was.</font>

70
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">It did. It did. Wasn't it?</font>

71
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:17,935

72
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,670

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>how to get</i> <i>revenge</i> on them.</font>

76

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're exactly right.</font>

77
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need revenge <i>on</i> them.</font>

78
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what I want, too.</font>

79
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, what's our plan?</font>

80
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,515

82
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, so here's-here's
how we're gonna do it.</font>

83
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

84
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna bang Tim Murphy's black wife.</font>

85
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

86
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

87
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

88
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll do it.</font>

89
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gonna humiliate him.</font>

90
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:41,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will humiliate him, yes!</font>

91
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

92
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'll do?</font>

93
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

94
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will bang Tim Murphy
to get back at Adriano.</font>

95
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:47,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's a good plan.</font>

96
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Yes!</font>

97
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is, I don't think Tim
Murphy would ever sleep with you.</font>

98
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a sec. Hold up.</font>

99
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

100
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you do...?</font>

101
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my part of the plan, then?</font>

102
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm... Oh, grab this.</font>

103
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only get two drink tickets.</font>

104
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

105
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

106
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

107
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I hanging here?</font>

108
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cool kids got us.</font>

109
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a massacre.</font>

110
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, shit!</font>

111
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you guys.</font>

112
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,095

113
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dee, get out of here.</font>

114
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from us.</font>

115
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from us.</font>

116
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

117
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you guys, I'm on your team, okay?</font>

118
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always <i>was</i> on your team.</font>

119
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a strike plan, but then
Cricket went and blew up my spot.</font>

120
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You goddamn bitch!</font>

121
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look, that's not the
important thing, all right?</font>

122
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitch!</font>

123
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The important part is that I'm
here now, and I'm on your</font>

124
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">team, and I want revenge, and I need you
guys to help me come up with a plan.</font>

125
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right.</font>

126
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:39,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need revenge, and I know
how we're gonna get it.</font>

127
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

128
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:42,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, we got to get the
freight train back together.</font>

129
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freight train?</font>

130
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a great idea.</font>

131
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like a plan.</font>

132
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. No, that's not a great idea.</font>

133
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a terrible idea.</font>

134
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:50,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is a freight train?</font>

135
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a stupid group of imbeciles
who called themselves a gang.</font>

136
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was basically just
Charlie, Mac, and Dooley.</font>

137
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">May he rest in peace.</font>

138
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">God rest his soul.</font>

139
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they were basically just
lackeys of this guy named Psycho</font>

140
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pete, who genuinely was mentally ill.</font>

141
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our conductor's insane.</font>

142
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our cargo is pain.</font>

143
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freight train!</font>

144
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freight train!</font>

145
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freight train!</font>

146
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

147
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get a hold of this
Psycho Pete and kick some ass.</font>

148
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

149
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it! Freight train!</font>

150
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:10,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, get us down.</font>

151
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

152
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

153
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't like that plan, so... Huh?</font>

154
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:15,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, get us down, Dee.</font>

155
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:16,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

156
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna kick some ass.</font>

157
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, come back here.</font>

158
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:18,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

159
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn...</font>

160
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:29,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's just see if they
have Psycho Pete's name tag</font>

161
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if they were expecting him.</font>

162
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:32,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause, if we get our psycho back,
we get the freight train back.</font>

163
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

164
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:34,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's his last name?</font>

165
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't know.</font>

166
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, me, neither.</font>

167
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we weren't really that close.</font>

168
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:40,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would have been cool
to be closer to him.</font>

169
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

170
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was such a dark,
mysterious guy, you know?</font>

171
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

172
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about this Peter
Schmidt— is that the guy?</font>

173
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:46,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

174
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:47,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, that's Schmitty.</font>

175
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, ah, shit, is he coming?</font>

176
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

177
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:51,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmitty would never come
to something like this.</font>

178
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not his scene.</font>

179
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:54,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, he'll swoop in at
the very end, grab the drunkest</font>

180
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">girl he can, take her home, bang her.</font>

181
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:56,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha, Schmitty's so cool.</font>

182
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:00,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Not that cool, though. Not as cool...
Way cooler than you, Dirtgrub.</font>

183
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as cool as Adriano.</font>

184
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:01,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop defending Adriano, okay?</font>

185
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stop with the Schmitty stuff?</font>

186
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, snipping with each
other— it's, like... Oh!</font>

187
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Magoo!</font>

188
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:08,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

189
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! I saw you trying to get by us.</font>

190
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

191
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't get away from us, Fatty,
Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo.</font>

192
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:13,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not fat anymore.</font>

193
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:14,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not even accurate.</font>

194
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:15,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha.</font>

195
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true.</font>

196
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you used to be fat.</font>

197
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:18,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

198
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I'm not now.</font>

199
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a thyroid problem.</font>

200
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:20,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your excuse?</font>

201
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:21,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tacked on mass.</font>

202
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:22,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

203
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tacked on lots of mass, yes.</font>

204
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, now,
do you remember Psycho Pete?</font>

205
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, yes.</font>

206
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any word on if he's
coming tonight, or...?</font>

207
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:29,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hope not.</font>

208
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:31,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the reason we have extra security.</font>

209
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threatened to burn
down the building.</font>

210
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha. That's...
He was probably just joking.</font>

211
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's his sense of humor.</font>

212
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a very dark sense of humor.</font>

213
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you got to
lighten up around Pete.</font>

214
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he joking when he cut his
family into little pieces and</font>

215
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:42,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">ate them for Christmas dinner?</font>

216
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:44,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't sound like a joke.</font>

217
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did that really happen?</font>

218
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that sounds much more serious.</font>

219
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's-That's grizzly.</font>

220
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grizzly?</font>

221
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:50,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psycho.</font>

222
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psycho is how it sounds.</font>

223
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psycho— that's what it is.</font>

224
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psycho.</font>

225
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how he got out of prison.</font>

226
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the insanity plea.</font>

227
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:56,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

228
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:57,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, that makes sense.</font>

229
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have gone with that
if I was his attorney.</font>

230
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, although, really I
specialize in bird law, so I</font>

231
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't want to mess around...
That's awesome.</font>

232
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, it was really nice to, uh... Okay.</font>

233
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess the freight
train is gone, is that it?</font>

234
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

235
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:10,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, let's get out of here.</font>

236
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I guess we're of to... It's over.</font>

237
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you guys, you guys,
you guys, okay, hi!</font>

238
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:15,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good to see you guys again.</font>

239
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change of plans, okay?</font>

240
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't think of my own thing
to do, so I want to join the</font>

241
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">freight train or whatever it is.</font>

242
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:20,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get lost, bitch.</font>

243
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no!</font>

244
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a second.</font>

245
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a second.</font>

246
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, guys, the freight train
never let a loser down in need.</font>

247
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Dee wants in on the freight train, we have
to let her in on the freight train.</font>

248
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee just has to do one thing.</font>

249
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got to go through the
freight train initiation.</font>

250
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to know that Dee's one of us.</font>

251
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Dee?</font>

252
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

253
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you willing to go through
the freight train initiation?</font>

254
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.</font>

255
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no!</font>

256
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, goddamn!</font>

257
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no!</font>

258
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a grown woman!</font>

259
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a grown woman! Aah!</font>

260
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, cuff links?</font>

261
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tim, at a high school reunion?</font>

262
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the Oscars.
I mean... Oh.</font>

263
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez!</font>

264
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:04,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and he can be a little
<i>too</i> nice sometimes.</font>

265
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:05,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

266
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can get a bit boring.</font>

267
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, trust me, Christie,
he's boring as shit.</font>

268
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that, all right?</font>

269
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather get blasted in the
balls by a battering ram than</font>

270
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">have to have a
conversation with the guy.</font>

271
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:14,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy!</font>

272
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:15,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I crazy? Am I?</font>

273
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:16,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

274
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">He deceives people, Christie.</font>

275
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

276
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what he d... Oh, yeah.</font>

277
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">He steps on his friends to climb
to the top of the mountaintop,</font>

278
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">where his good friend used to reign
supreme, that's what he does.</font>

279
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, quite frankly, Christie,
I think you can do a</font>

280
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">lot better than him.</font>

281
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's good to me.</font>

282
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:32,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
Yeah, but does he appreciate you?</font>

283
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:36,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Christie, does he appreciate...
all of that?</font>

284
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis!</font>

285
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby's got back, Christie.</font>

286
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby's got back.</font>

287
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:42,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm saying?</font>

288
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:43,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I right, though?</font>

289
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I right?</font>

290
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, listen, listen.</font>

291
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be inside you.</font>

292
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:50,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to do shit to you that is
gonna make you realize what a</font>

293
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">worthless, boring piece of
shit your husband really is.</font>

294
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second, I'm confused.</font>

295
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you want to have sex with <i>me?</i></font>

296
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,212
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why the hell wouldn't I
want to have sex with you?</i></font>

297
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,548
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I mean, bam, boom, boom.</i></font>

298
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,084
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Because you're gay.</i></font>

299
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,084
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What?</i></font>

300
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,252
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm not gay.</i></font>

301
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,420
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dude, you're wearing makeup.</i></font>

302
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, I'm wearing a
little bit of makeup.</i></font>

303
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,424
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who-who doesn't... And a girdle.</i></font>

304
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,926
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, I wanted to seem
thin for the occasion.</i></font>

305

00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

449
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronald McDonald slept
with your prom date.</font>

450
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he tell you that I slept with her?</font>

451
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never would have
slept with that chick.</font>

452
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was <i>gross.</i></font>

453
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,446
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She was gross.</i></font>

454
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,447
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She</i> <i>was</i> gross.</font>

455
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was gross, I remember that, yeah.</font>

456
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was really gross.</font>

457
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slept with my prom date?</font>

458
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

459
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

460
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do that to me?</font>

461
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was very easy.</font>

462
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, she was a whore.</font>

463
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:19,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill you.</font>

464
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:20,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't.</font>

465
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill you!</font>

466
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill you, you
fat piece of shit!</font>

467
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mass!</font>

468
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mass!</font>

469
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make it about my weight!</font>

470
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are good. So... Take care!</font>

471
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know she was a whore, but
she was <i>my</i> whore!</font>

472
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!</font>

473
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down!</font>

474
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:35,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is pathetic.</font>

475
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is awful.</font>

476
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all been humiliated.</font>

477
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:41,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our asses are destroyed.</font>

478
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

479
00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:45,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

480
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Dennis turned out to be a loser.</font>

481
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:47,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

482
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just go back to the bar, right?</font>

483
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:50,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bar's where we belong.</font>

484
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:51,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bar's where we fit in.</font>

485
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can hide from the world at the bar.</font>

486
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, I agree with Charlie.</font>

487
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never want to step foot in
this high school ever again.</font>

488
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:57,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

489
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:58,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

490
00:13:58,867 --> 00:13:59,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

491
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't go out like that.</font>

492
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:06,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if life pushes you
down, you got to push back.</font>

493
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're dealt a bunch of
lemons, you got to take those</font>

494
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:14,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">lemons and stuff them down somebody's
throat until they see yellow.</font>

495
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:18,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if some punk-ass kid
humiliates you, you got to do</font>

496
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only thing that's left to do.</font>

497
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:21,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

498
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:22,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa.</font>

499
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:22,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Frank.</font>

500
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow, that was a great speech, man.</font>

501
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the most coherent thing
that's ever come out of your mouth.</font>

502
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:27,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was awesome, dude.</font>

503
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You usually just ramble
on and on and on.</font>

504
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:30,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was like a basketball coach.</font>

505
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, so what is it?</font>

506
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:32,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

507
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

508
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

509
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the one thing left to do?</font>

510
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

511
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:46,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the thing of it is, is that,
uh, there's the lemon stuff.</font>

512
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

513
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you got Mac, who's a rat.</font>

514
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Dee's body brace.</font>

515
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:59,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, and that's the thing of it, and...
It's good.</font>

516
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:00,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you saying?</font>

517
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:03,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you were gonna tell us what to do.</font>

518
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't... we didn't ask if
something was good or if it wasn't good.</font>

519
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:06,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost my train of thought.</font>

520
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:07,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go back to the bar.</font>

521
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:08,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

522
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

523
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you gonna suggest
that we should do plan B?</font>

524
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

525
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plan B!</font>

526
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I was going to say!</font>

527
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's... we're not doing plan B.</font>

528
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, man, hey, listen.</font>

529
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">We worked so hard on it.</font>

530
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, we're not doing
plan B, it's ridiculous.</font>

531
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, Dennis, plan B might be
the only option we have left.</font>

532
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, come on.</font>

533
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:26,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Dennis.</font>

534
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus, come on, plan B is...
- Plan B, plan B... Shh, not too loud.</font>

535
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's... All right, all right.</font>

536
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:36,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stop whispering plan B like
it's some super covert CIA operation?</font>

537
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plan B is a dance routine.</font>

538
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a goddamned dance routine.</font>

539
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's gonna rock.</font>

540
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep beep.</font>

541
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.</font>

542
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:54,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep beep bop.</font>

543
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need this dance floor...
Clear the dance floor.</font>

544
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:58,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear the dance floor.</font>

545
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:00,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, let's go.</font>

546
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:01,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it on, bitches!</font>

547
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:01,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on!</font>

548
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, listen up, jerks!</font>

549
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to us, listen to us.</font>

550
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:08,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been a lot of negative energy
going on at this school, okay?</font>

551
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I want to talk to you guys
a little bit about dancing.</font>

552
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, back in the '50s and the
'60s and the '70s, people used</font>

553
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">to dance all the time.</font>

554
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the way we solved
our problems back then.</font>

555
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:21,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how they solved their
problems— through dance.</font>

556
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:23,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, all of a sudden,
we stopped dancing.</font>

557
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know?</font>

558
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:29,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grunge came in, we dressed in
plaid and oversized jeans.</font>

559
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:32,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, later on, kids wore trench
coats and shot each other in</font>

560
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">school, and that's not cool.</font>

561
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">But guess what.</font>

562
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:36,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what's going on
in the high school now.</font>

563
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kids are dancing again.</font>

564
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Organized choreographed dance.</font>

565
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:42,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're doing organized choreographed
dances to solve their problems.</font>

566
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">They also give each other blow jobs.</font>

567
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got these things
called rainbow parties.</font>

568
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Charlie.</font>

569
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:47,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, wrap it up,
wrap it up, wrap it up.</font>

570
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:48,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

571
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:51,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but they have these rain...
Yeah, but that's not the point of the...</font>

572
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, we're
gonna show you a dance!</font>

573
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get started.</font>

574
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

575
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lights.</font>

576
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...!</font>

577
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:28,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...!</font>

578
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:39,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...!</font>

579
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five, six, seven, eight.</font>

580
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:59,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine, it's fine.</font>

581
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:03,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was weird.</font>

582
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:04,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everyone!</font>

583
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">After party back at
my house, all right?</font>

584
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's invited.</font>

585
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:09,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except them.</font>

586
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

587
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:20,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...</font>

588
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:21,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sucked.</font>

589
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:22,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man.</font>

590
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:23,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a perfect dance.</font>

591
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:24,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just didn't respond to it.</font>

592
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand how that didn't
blow people's minds, though.</font>

593
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:29,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys, we did a great job, okay?</font>

594
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, don't, don't get down
on yourselves, all right?</font>

595
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:31,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people are stupid.</font>

596
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're idiots, they're savages.</font>

597
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:33,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just didn't get it.</font>

598
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

599
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,409
