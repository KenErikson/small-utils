1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but I can't believe I
never even noticed this place before.</font>

2
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I walk by it all the time.</font>

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you notice it?</font>

4
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:10,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no sign outside.</font>

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what's up with that?</font>

6
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think it like blew down
in a storm or something?</font>

7
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no storm.</font>

8
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the owners did it on purpose
'cause they think it's cool.</font>

9
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">They blew on their sign until it came
off 'cause they thought it was cool?</font>

11
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, who does that?</font>

12
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, nobody blew anything.</font>

13
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dee, how did you find
out about this place?</font>

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody sent me a
link to their Facebook page.</font>

15
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook— that's why
everybody's here.</font>

16
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:29,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

17
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:30,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

18
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:31,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this water?</font>

19
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:33,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's gin.</font>

20
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:33,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

21
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gin? I hate gin!</font>

22
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:35,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me a beer!</font>

23
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:36,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me a beer!</font>

24
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:37,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me a beer!</font>

25
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beer!</font>

26
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:38,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a gin bar.</font>

27
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">All they have is gin.</font>

28
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding?</font>

29
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

30
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean to tell me there's this
many people in this joint—</font>

31
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">all they serve is gin?</font>

32
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only reason that people are
here, is because Facebook</font>

33
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">tells them to come here.</font>

34
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the kind of shit
we need at Paddy's.</font>

35
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paddy's got no Web presence.</font>

36
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are absolutely right.</font>

37
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world
is connected now.</font>

38
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:57,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all connected by Bill Gates
and that rain man, Zuckerberg.</font>

39
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:00,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and his Jews have connected the
whole world, and now they're</font>

40
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:01,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">toppling regimes.</font>

41
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Egypt and Japan and the Jews
are all peaceful together...</font>

42
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:06,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand the spirit
of what you're saying.</font>

43
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:07,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

44
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:08,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook is connecting
everyone these days.</font>

45
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even people in the Middle East.</font>

46
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm talking about.</font>

47
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, and look people are showing
up to a bar that doesn't</font>

48
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">even have a sign, and serves
only one old-timey disgusting</font>

49
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:15,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">drink that nobody likes.</font>

50
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn I hate gin.</font>

51
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you bitch.</font>

52
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the thing.</font>

53
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place has got a
good business model.</font>

54
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:23,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to emulate it.</font>

55
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:24,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's absolutely right.</font>

56
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get rid of all
the beer in Paddy's.</font>

57
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to blow the sign off of
the building— you know, maybe</font>

58
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do the blowing,
that's fine.</font>

59
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:32,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, Charlie, stop,
stop, stop, stop.</font>

60
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think a human being can
blow a sign off of a building?</font>

61
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't until Mac said it.</font>

62
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:36,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said that.</font>

63
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:39,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man cannot blow a
sign off of a building.</font>

64
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:42,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Charlie's defense, you could loosen
the screws, get up there and blow...</font>

65
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are talking about
the Internet.</font>

66
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are derailing
the conversation.</font>

67
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

68
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Ew.</font>

69
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:56,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

70
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:57,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, don't worry
about it, okay.</font>

71
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we got to get on this.</font>

72
00:01:59,147 --> 00:01:59,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's absolutely right.</font>

73
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:01,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">No distractions.</font>

74
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paddy's needs to get connected.</font>

76
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the Gin Bar's
Facebook page.</font>

77
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have like 50,000 friends.</font>

78
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy.</font>

79
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Links to Twitter viral videos.</font>

80
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:35,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their Web presence
is a amazing.</font>

81
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could do a viral
video for Paddy's.</font>

82
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we can't afford not to.</font>

83
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

84
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll do a really cool video of
how we serve gin in spaghetti</font>

85
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">cans or something like that.</font>

86
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we take the sign down.</font>

87
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you're getting hung
up on the wrong things.</font>

88
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:49,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old booze and the no sign
have nothing to do with it.</font>

89
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what kind of a douchebag
walks into a bar just</font>

90
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:52,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it doesn't have
a sign outside of it?</font>

91
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:53,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's stupid, Frank.</font>

92
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:54,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use your head.</font>

93
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:57,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's the most important
thing— exclusivity.</font>

94
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird drinks, no
sign, that's cool.</font>

95
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:03,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe so, but I like
Paddy's sign, so it stays up.</font>

96
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got the sign down.</font>

97
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's no way a man could
have blown that off of our bar.</font>

98
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's just no way.</font>

99
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're totally wrong
about that, Mac.</font>

100
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:10,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

101
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never once said that!</font>

102
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:12,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not?</font>

103
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, forget it, forget it.</font>

104
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, we're doing a viral
video thing now, okay?</font>

105
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:15,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

106
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I stop all this
for one second?</font>

107
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mean to derail us,
'cause this is very, very</font>

108
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">important stuff, but, um, I'm getting
a little hung up on something.</font>

109
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:27,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy that shushed us last night—
is that bugging anybody else?</font>

110
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking
about that, too.</font>

111
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been
thinking about that?</font>

112
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really have.</font>

113
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

114
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:33,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were in the middle of
telling Charlie to keep quiet.</font>

115
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:35,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was telling him to be quiet,
I was telling him to be quiet.</font>

116
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:36,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell everybody to be quiet.</font>

117
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't shush them
like they're animals.</font>

118
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I use my words.</font>

119
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.</font>

120
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go get
the video camera.</font>

121
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:41,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

122
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

123
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, you're normally very excited
about making videos, all right?</font>

124
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:45,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, let's just focus.</font>

125
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:46,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have bigger fish to fry.</font>

126
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:47,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let it go.</font>

127
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let it go.</font>

128
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let it go either.</font>

129
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't let it go.</font>

130
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:50,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm irritated by it.</font>

131
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to let it go.</font>

132
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, but the viral video
thing is very important.</font>

133
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get to that.</font>

134
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll pop a shush on the
guy and we'll be right back.</font>

135
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:58,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's... Yeah.</font>

136
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can just find the
guy on Facebook.</font>

137
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:00,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where you find
people these days.</font>

138
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You aren't going to find
the guy on Facebook.</font>

139
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's three billion
people on there.</font>

140
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:04,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you crazy?</font>

141
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you don't even
know the guy's name.</font>

142
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know his name.</font>

143
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on Facebook, magically find a guy.</font>

144
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook.</font>

145
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:12,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found him.</font>

146
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

147
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:13,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

148
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:14,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was friends
with the Gin Bar.</font>

149
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:14,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.</font>

150
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:15,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's him.</font>

151
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:16,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him.</font>

152
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook is amazing.</font>

153
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:17,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

154
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:18,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all connected.</font>

155
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:18,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

156
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all connected.</font>

157
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're connected.</font>

158
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's get back to business.</font>

159
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:22,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, viral video.</font>

160
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but now that I'm seeing his face...
Mm-hmm.</font>

161
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to be honest...
It was very annoying last night that.</font>

162
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">It pissed me off, all right?</font>

163
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we can just, you know, send
him a friend request and then...</font>

164
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, see if he responds.</font>

165
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we'll get back
to what we were doing.</font>

166
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:34,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, distracted.</font>

167
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he respond?</font>

168
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:36,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

169
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it usually take?</font>

170
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it depends on
if he's online or not.</font>

171
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refresh.</font>

172
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refresh.</font>

173
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:41,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

174
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you hit it faster?</font>

175
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, here's the problem with,
like, Facebook and Twitter.</font>

176
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, everyone says, oh, it's
changing the world, but not</font>

177
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a good way, you know.</font>

178
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not connected with
each other anymore.</font>

179
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweeting— that's not
having a conversation.</font>

180
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:55,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

181
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

182
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then these people who do
that shit, they hear you having</font>

183
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">a real conversation with your
real buddies, your real pals,</font>

184
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they get all jealous and pissed
off and they want to shush you.</font>

185
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:03,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right.</font>

186
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:05,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what else is
bugging me about this guy?</font>

187
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot get past the fact
that we're perfect strangers.</font>

188
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know me.</font>

189
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, for all this guy knows,
I'm a psychopath with a trunk</font>

190
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">full of chainsaws, right?</font>

191
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:17,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shushs me 'cause he doesn't like
the volume of my conversation?</font>

192
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:20,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next thing he knows he's chopped to
bits in a basement somewhere, you know?</font>

193
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that worth it?</font>

194
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

195
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I could be a man with a
fist full of hammers... Right.</font>

196
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a trunk full of
duct tape and zip ties.</font>

197
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, this guy
doesn't know me.</font>

198
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he crazy?</font>

199
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very upsetting to me that
he didn't consider any of that.</font>

200
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, this is not a
considerate man, Charlie.</font>

201
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:34,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a rude man, and they are
very seldom the same people.</font>

202
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

203
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, sir?</font>

204
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

205
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get you for a second?</font>

206
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a...
What can I get for you guys?</font>

207
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're looking for a man.</font>

208
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this guy was
a real douchebag.</font>

209
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:46,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was in here the other night.</font>

210
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, douche-y looking.</font>

211
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of douche-y.</font>

212
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I wish I had a picture
of the guy, but we don't.</font>

213
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:52,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's a shusher.</font>

214
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, right.</font>

215
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:57,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a douchebag who goes around
shushing people that he doesn't even know.</font>

216
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, people who could
have chainsaws.</font>

217
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or hammers.</font>

218
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:02,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, is any of this
ringing a bell to you?</font>

219
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Sorry.</font>

220
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:06,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't really see
what the big deal is.</font>

221
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:06,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">The big deal.</font>

222
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't see what
the big deal is?</font>

223
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">The big deal, sir, is that a grown
man shushed me and my friend here.</font>

224
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:13,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">We demand satisfaction
from this person, okay?</font>

225
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to find this guy because
we've got some important shit</font>

226
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we're trying to do on
the Internet, or whatever.</font>

227
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have much bigger
things going on.</font>

228
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:19,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sign is down, okay?</font>

229
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:20,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sign is down.</font>

230
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:21,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took our sign down.</font>

231
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never been down, you
see what I'm saying?</font>

232
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

233
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting frustrated.</font>

234
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:26,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also very frustrated.</font>

235
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, how would you
like to be shushed?</font>

236
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:29,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think I'd care.</font>

237
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

238
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that feel?</font>

239
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I was finished speaking.</font>

240
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, shh to you!</font>

241
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:37,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, I was done, so...
You're speaking too fast.</font>

242
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:39,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop speaking in such
short sentences.</font>

243
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we can shush you in the
middle and you'll know how it feels.</font>

244
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, do you guys want
a drink, or what?</font>

245
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:43,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

246
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we want drinks.</font>

247
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:45,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

248
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, two house specials?</font>

249
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

250
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:49,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Specials, yeah.</font>

251
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:50,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, two house specials.</font>

252
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:50,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got interrupted.</font>

253
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that feel?</font>

254
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:53,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your away.</font>

255
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you got him
with that one, though.</font>

256
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't exactly
feel good about it.</font>

257
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:58,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

258
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he had to know how it feels.</font>

259
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:00,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you nailed him.</font>

260
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:01,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, man.</font>

261
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:06,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know, I think I know how we
can get a picture of this shusher guy.</font>

262
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you thinking?</font>

263
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refresh.</font>

264
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:14,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

265
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't this guy
be our friend?</font>

266
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like an online shush.</font>

267
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:20,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I... Okay, Paddy's Pub
has over 30 friends at this point.</font>

268
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why will this guy not
accept our friend request.</font>

269
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:23,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's too good for us?</font>

270
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't complain, just
hit refresh again.</font>

271
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch!</font>

272
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got the video camera.</font>

273
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:34,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Mac, say,
"I got infected."</font>

274
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:34,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

275
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:35,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it.</font>

276
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got infected.</font>

277
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:38,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get that away from me.</font>

278
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, okay, now here we go.</font>

279
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, "I got the bug."</font>

280
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:43,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm busy, Frank.</font>

281
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:44,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, "bug."</font>

282
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bug!</font>

283
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

284
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm shooting the virus thing.</font>

285
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">What virus thing?</font>

286
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The virus thing that you guys
said we were going to infect all</font>

287
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">our friends with on
Facebook or whatever.</font>

288
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:55,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! We got him!</font>

289
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:56,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got him?</font>

290
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got you, Dylan Toback!</font>

291
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:58,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You giant douche!</font>

292
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:02,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys gonna help me
do the virus thing, or what?</font>

293
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're busy right now, Frank.</font>

294
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're doing the
shushing thing first, Frank.</font>

295
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:08,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you said the virus video
was the most important thing!</font>

296
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no! No!</font>

297
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">We said the viral video is very
important, and it is very</font>

298
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">important— but we're
on to this now.</font>

299
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:14,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we'll do it later.</font>

300
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:17,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you get it started and then
we'll come and fix what you did, okay?</font>

301
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, but hurry up.</font>

302
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, check out these updates:</font>

303
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I am a man-whore.</font>

304
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:22,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate women.</font>

305
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:23,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a liar."</font>

306
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">He admits that he is a liar.</font>

307
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch!</font>

308
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:30,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, looks like he is shopping for a
silk sash at Tootie's, on South Street.</font>

309
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">A silk sash at Tootie's?</font>

310
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:33,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">What an asshole.</font>

311
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

312
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay... Daddy got a new plan.</font>

313
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:36,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

314
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:37,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy got a new plan.</font>

315
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's head down to Tootie's and we'll
fire a shush right in his face.</font>

316
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll shush him real quick.</font>

317
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we won't tell Dennis and
Charlie, 'cause they mocked us.</font>

318
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, we'll tell
them, though, right?</font>

319
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we won't tell them right
now, but we'll come back</font>

320
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:48,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll jam it in their faces.</font>

321
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze!</font>

322
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:50,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, once we shush him.</font>

323
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's go.</font>

324
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:51,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. All right.</font>

325
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great idea. Great idea!</font>

326
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:55,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to make sure you got
the nose right, though.</font>

327
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:57,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the most important part to me,
because it was an annoying nose.</font>

328
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:00,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an... It was a nose that
you wanted to smack, yeah.</font>

329
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, give him, like, almond eyes if you...
You've already said that.</font>

330
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't compliment the man.</font>

331
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:06,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a compliment from me, 'cause
I don't like people with almond eyes.</font>

332
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:07,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find it creepy.</font>

333
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, can we just
take a look at the drawing?</font>

334
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:11,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we kinda need
to get out of here.</font>

335
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:12,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done an excellent job.</font>

336
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:13,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really good! Wow!</font>

337
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:16,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is your technique, sir,
because I want to learn that.</font>

338
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is... You know, the only thing
that would help this, is if you had</font>

339
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">him do this gesture...
Oh, my God.</font>

340
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When the man assaulted us...
- Mr.</font>

341
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reynolds, Mr.
Kelly, I'm Detective Larson.</font>

342
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:28,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna need to clear something
up on your report here.</font>

343
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't... Yeah, we're good.</font>

344
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're good, actually, 'cause we got...
It says here this was filed</font>

345
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:35,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an assault, but the only
thing that you're claiming was</font>

346
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this man shushed you?</font>

347
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

348
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

349
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it was an assault.</font>

350
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shushing somebody
is not an assault.</font>

351
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:46,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was more to it than...
He— yeah— it wasn't just shushing, though...</font>

352
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... And the reason it was an
assault was because he was</font>

353
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">shushing our cries for help.</font>

354
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. This guy was raping us...</font>

355
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:54,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... wha...?</font>

356
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:55,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was raping you.</font>

357
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, yeah... Yeah.</font>

358
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:58,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

359
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">The both of you?</font>

360
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:00,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You can't rape two guys.</font>

361
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:02,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No... no, no, no.</font>

362
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't even necessarily classify it...
You know what happened was</font>

363
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he only raped
my friend here.</font>

364
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:08,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually shook
him off in time.</font>

365
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy never quite made it inside
of me but, my friend here, yeah...</font>

366
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:12,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he was only raping you?</font>

367
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

368
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... yeah.</font>

369
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:18,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">He, like, really, kinda made soup
of your insides... No... n no, no.</font>

370
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">He barely, he barely made it in
there, so, trust me, I'm fine.</font>

371
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but he bit his dick.</font>

372
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not— what?</font>

373
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:27,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he did... He, he...
the reason we were going to file as a rape was</font>

374
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he did make it inside
me, but, like, just barely.</font>

375
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:33,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the guy was
super-small, so I'm fine.</font>

376
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:34,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I did get away.</font>

377
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't-don't-don't
write any of this down.</font>

378
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, can we just
drop the case?</font>

379
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

380
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

381
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:44,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to... We just need the drawing...
I don't even think about</font>

382
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">that, because if we have the
drawing, we can find the guy.</font>

383
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:48,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can dole out the justice,
and I'll mend this guy's...</font>

384
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then this never needs to
go in any files anywhere.</font>

385
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you and Mr. Reynolds are
filing a false police report,</font>

386
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's no way in hell you're getting
out of here with that drawing.</font>

387
00:10:56,706 --> 00:11:00,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Charlie.</font>

388
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got another plan.</font>

389
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

390
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's perfect.</font>

391
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks exactly like him!</font>

392
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I mean, he wasn't in a dune buggy
and he didn't have... No, he was not.</font>

393
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">a propeller on his head, like that, but...
I like the shushing, though.</font>

394
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You nailed the shushing!</font>

395
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:20,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tootie's... Tootie's...
This is it.</font>

396
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew!</font>

397
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:22,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that him?</font>

398
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him.</font>

399
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is him.</font>

400
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this.</font>

401
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dylan Toback.</font>

402
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Hey.</font>

403
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:33,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that, ma'am.</font>

404
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:34,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, ma'am.</font>

405
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:36,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we thought you were
this guy, Dylan Toback.</font>

406
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shushed us and...
And we were gonna shush him back, yeah.</font>

407
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:40,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

408
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't think you were a man, per se...
I did.</font>

409
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I did, too.</font>

410
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did because of your hair.</font>

411
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:47,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's why: it's the hair and it's
the cardigan, and it's the build...</font>

412
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the way you stand,
and the broad shoulders.</font>

413
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's okay.</font>

414
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay.</font>

415
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing you
can do about that.</font>

416
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice day.</font>

417
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still confused.</font>

418
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very confused.</font>

419
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's sort of a
transgender situation.</font>

420
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys
looking for Dylan Toback?</font>

421
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Do you know him?</font>

422
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">He posted on Facebook
that he was here.</font>

423
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can you guys
keep a secret?</font>

424
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:05,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

425
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes.</font>

426
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:07,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I can... yes, yes.</font>

427
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:08,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes.</font>

428
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't him, it was me.</font>

429
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I started a Facebook
page to get back at him.</font>

430
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his ex-girlfriend
and he was the worst.</font>

431
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was always, like,
"Sally, send me money."</font>

432
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:17,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sally, mail me hair."</font>

433
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:18,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mail him hair?</font>

434
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird, right?</font>

435
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and then he posted a bunch
of naked pics of me online,</font>

436
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:24,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that was the last straw.</font>

437
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

438
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's disgusting!</font>

439
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naked pics online?</font>

440
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where? Where did he post those?</font>

441
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:30,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

442
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:33,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of those disgusting
ex-girlfriend porno sites.</font>

443
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, those disgusting
ex-girlfriend porno sites!</font>

444
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, there's so
many of them, though!</font>

445
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one?</font>

446
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:39,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one did he post it on?</font>

447
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where
we can find him?</font>

448
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:43,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can give you his address.</font>

449
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a shit.</font>

450
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

451
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:46,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great! Great!</font>

452
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:48,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, put down one of the sites that was...
Listen, do you want to come</font>

453
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:50,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">with us, and maybe
get some payback?</font>

454
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:54,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's... well...
- Here's the thing: he's never actually met me.</font>

455
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:57,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the pics I sent were a
little more flattering than I</font>

456
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:02,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually am, and so we just sort
of had this online relationship.</font>

457
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm! Mm-hmm.</font>

458
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the hair I mailed was mine.</font>

459
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was real.</font>

460
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:07,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what?</font>

461
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">This chick is
douchier than Dylan.</font>

462
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get outta here!</font>

463
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:11,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

464
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not even gonna look
for those nude photos.</font>

465
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:14,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might.</font>

466
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might, though.</font>

467
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:18,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might.</font>

468
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man— this
guy's been in here.</font>

469
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:23,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got the annoying nose that you
wanted to smack... Evil almond eyes.</font>

470
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:26,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, guys, I've never seen a
cartoon character in here shushing</font>

471
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">people before.</font>

472
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he wasn't in a dune buggy, he was...
Look, use your imagination.</font>

473
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's not a cartoon
character, okay?</font>

474
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you just take
this seriously?</font>

475
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how I could
take this seriously.</font>

476
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:37,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not helping.</font>

477
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

478
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not going to
be a help to us.</font>

479
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:43,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just going to be difficult,
so just go get us more gin drinks.</font>

480
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you're good for.</font>

481
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:45,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">More of the gin.</font>

482
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:47,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">God. All right...
Here's what I'm gonna do, Charlie.</font>

483
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:50,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to write "Rude man who
shushes, please call" at tat</font>

484
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">top, and then, at the bottom,
I'll put my phone number.</font>

485
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:53,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

486
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right? And then we'll make a
shitload of copies, we'll put</font>

487
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">them up all over town, and it'll
act like a wanted poster.</font>

488
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, wait, so you want
the rude man to call you?</font>

489
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I want people to call
me about the rude man.</font>

490
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, if the rude man calls
me that works, too.</font>

491
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">That works, too!</font>

492
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

493
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:07,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gonna work.</font>

494
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:09,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hold on a second— you're
cool just putting your</font>

495
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:10,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">personal information out there?</font>

496
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:13,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! I'm absolutely cool with that, man,
because I'm saying "connect with me."</font>

497
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:14,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

498
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, that's what we're talking about—
people just don't connect these days.</font>

499
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying call me, let's
have a phone conversation.</font>

500
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:21,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, don't tweet.</font>

501
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't just tweet me, don't shush
me— you know, let's connect.</font>

502
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a
connection, you know?</font>

503
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:26,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be rude!</font>

504
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about rude people.</font>

505
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about people who
do rude things, you know?</font>

506
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:30,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

507
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guarantee you, people
will respect this.</font>

508
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, one little
roadblock, no big deal.</font>

509
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let's shush this guy and
get out of here, because it's</font>

510
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:36,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting to get complicated.</font>

511
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And what was
happening back there?</font>

512
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sending nude pictures
of yourself?</font>

513
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:43,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just stupid,
and that's desperate.</font>

514
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and hair?</font>

515
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, sending hair—
that's just demented.</font>

516
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:49,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the hair I don't
really have a problem with.</font>

517
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:50,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

518
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the point of that?</font>

519
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">You send your hair to a guy
and, you know, you just give</font>

520
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">that guy a sense of you and your smells...
and... you know... Oh! Oh!</font>

521
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

522
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:01,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for Dylan Toback.</font>

523
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he around?</font>

524
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:06,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lord...
I knew this day would come.</font>

525
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... come in.</font>

526
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but listen, we don't
have a lot of time, okay?</font>

527
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, a few months ago, my
daughter Jamela bought me this</font>

528
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:20,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">brand-new computer, and she put it right here...
Speed up, speed up, speed up!</font>

529
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:24,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, ever since Jerry
got put on life support—</font>

530
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Slow down, slow
down, slow down!</font>

531
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew! I didn't see him there.</font>

532
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had nothing but
time on my hands.</font>

533
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:33,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been so
lonely, you know?</font>

534
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:37,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, does any of this have
anything to do with Dylan Toback?</font>

535
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:37,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, why is she doing that?</font>

536
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... I am Dylan Toback.</font>

537
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:43,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no... Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm...
Don't say that!</font>

538
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have time
for that, okay?</font>

539
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anybody online the person
who they say that they are?</font>

540
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, do you know how to
find the real Dylan Toback?</font>

541
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what I'm saying
is he doesn't exist.</font>

542
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:56,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made up the name Dylan Toback.</font>

543
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made up dozens of names.</font>

544
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:00,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really good at it.</font>

545
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">My real name is Catfish!</font>

546
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is happening here?</font>

547
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what I gather.</font>

548
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she went on the Gin Bar's
Web site, found a picture</font>

549
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">of that guy and then made up a whole
name and personality for him.</font>

550
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:12,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we don't know the guy's name.</font>

551
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:13,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

552
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even know
if he's on Facebook.</font>

553
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:15,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

554
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the hell are
we gonna find him?</font>

555
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:17,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

556
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:18,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how did you find me?</font>

557
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it that Sally?</font>

558
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that bitch been
getting on my nerves.</font>

559
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know Sally?</font>

560
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, Dylan knows Sally.</font>

561
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he doesn't, 'cause Dylan
isn't real, and you know what?</font>

562
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:30,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sally isn't Sally anymore;
Sally is now Dylan.</font>

563
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:32,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about the nude photos? I mean...
This is not about the nude</font>

564
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">photos, Mac... Shh! Shh!</font>

565
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you shush me!</font>

566
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you shush us, goddamn it.</font>

567
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't disturb Jerry.</font>

568
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:37,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disturb Jerry? I'm disturbed.</font>

569
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:38,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should be disturbed.</font>

570
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:40,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole thing is disturbing,
and if you shush me</font>

571
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">one more time I will put you in the ground.
Do you hear me?</font>

572
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay you know what? Dee, Dee!</font>

573
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're losing focus, all right?</font>

574
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get back to the bar,
we'll find the nude photos...</font>

575
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, yeah, let's-let's focus on the...
Well, hold on.</font>

576
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want your hair back?</font>

577
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that your hair, Dee?
- Oh, come on.</font>

578
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Carl Lundegard?</font>

579
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

580
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:06,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what is the problem?</font>

581
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we not putting these
in the right part of town?</font>

582
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">We put them in every part of town...</font>

583
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, here we go, here we go.</font>

584
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on.</font>

585
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:15,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

586
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:16,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saw that guy you
were looking for.</font>

587
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did?</font>

588
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

589
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:21,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's great, okay, can you
tell us where exactly the... Shh!</font>

590
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:22,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no, oh, you do not! Oh!</font>

591
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:23,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... ugh! He shushed me.</font>

592
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another one?</font>

593
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:26,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, another shusher
shushing me on the phone.</font>

594
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, maybe the poster is
the problem because it says</font>

595
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Rude man who shushes
please call..."</font>

596
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:30,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

597
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">So rude men are calling
just to shush you.</font>

598
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:33,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is prank calls.</font>

599
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:35,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I gonna have to change my phone number?
I mean, that's...</font>

600
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, because you never want to
put your personal information</font>

601
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:38,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">out there in the world.</font>

602
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:40,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like... People abuse it.</font>

603
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo! Did you find the guy?</font>

604
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:42,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He's unfindable.</font>

605
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just hit a bunch of dead ends, right?
The guy is a ghost, I'm telling you.</font>

606
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know! We tried to track him down on
Facebook, but it got very strange.</font>

607
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, it was just a bunch of girls
pretending to be boys, and</font>

608
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee banged a o fat old black
la, and then sent her hair.</font>

609
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's not... Hey!
I did the video, and I sent it to all of Paddy's</font>

610
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook friends.</font>

611
00:17:58,771 --> 00:17:59,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did?</font>

612
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:00,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

613
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:01,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank to the rescue.</font>

614
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:02,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ho! Frank saves the day.</font>

615
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:03,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

616
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:04,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good work, Frank.</font>

617
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

618
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:06,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check out what you got here.</font>

619
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:12,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Paddy's Pub...
the oldest pub in America.</font>

620
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not true.</font>

621
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:14,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

622
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I lied.
Everybody lies on the Internet.</font>

623
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:19,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right. Everybody out there is lying
to get what they want; why can't we?</font>

624
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

625
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:26,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a variety of old liquors
served in strange containers.</font>

626
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:30,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are packed with
celebrities— the fun ones.</font>

627
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also have cockfights
and strippers.</font>

628
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">And guess what?</font>

629
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:40,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have a sign, so
good luck finding the place.</font>

630
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:43,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you do, you'll be lucky.</font>

631
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we also got donkey
shows, Motley Crue and cake.</font>

632
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:48,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome, awesome.</font>

633
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:49,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. Frank!</font>

634
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:50,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome.</font>

635
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:51,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is awesome.</font>

636
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to hand it to you, I
think I would go to this bar.</font>

637
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would definitely
go to that bar.</font>

638
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the best
part, coming up.</font>

639
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, spread the word to all of
your friends: At Paddy's Pub,</font>

640
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:04,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- you're guaranteed to catch a...
- Virus!</font>

641
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ask this guy.</font>

642
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:08,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got infected.</font>

643
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it away from me.</font>

644
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or her.</font>

645
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm busy.</font>

646
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:16,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks like she caught the...
Bug!</font>

647
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:21,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">So spread this video to all of your
friends, because it's a computer virus.</font>

648
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Virus!</font>

649
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it from me.</font>

650
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:32,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a doctor... Dr. Toboggan.</font>

651
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mantis Toboggan.</font>

652
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:40,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

653
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent that to all of
our Facebook friends?</font>

654
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

655
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:46,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna think they have
a computer virus, Frank.</font>

656
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, you're the ones who said
we needed the virus video.</font>

657
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said a "viral video,"</font>

658
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:52,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank. Goddamn it. Goddamn it!</font>

659
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, we never should've
left him in charge.</font>

660
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:56,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the problem is we
got focused on the guy.</font>

661
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't help him with his...
This whole thing is a total mess.</font>

662
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, absolutely nothing
good has come of today.</font>

663
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, we wasted all of our...
- Excuse me.</font>

664
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a bar, right?</font>

665
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:10,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">We noticed you guys didn't
have a sign out front.</font>

666
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:14,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought that was pretty cool.</font>

667
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys open?</font>

668
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are.</font>

669
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, lock the door.</font>

670
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,291
