00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, why are the
urinals filled with rocks?</font>

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:06,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, 'cause I put
a bunch of rocks in 'em.</font>

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:09,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, why?</font>

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know how they were broken,
so I was, like, filling them with ice.</font>

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the ice machine's broken, so I'm
just filling them up with rocks.</font>

6
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that doesn't
make any sense, right?</font>

7
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Replacing the ice with rocks?</font>

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ice actually served a purpose...
Oh, oh, God!</font>

9
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, something just
dripped in my mouth!</font>

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, the ceiling is leaking.</font>

11
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's gross.</font>

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd it taste like?</font>

13
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd it taste like?</font>

14
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gives a shit what
it tasted like, Frank?</font>

15
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what the hell?</font>

16
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:35,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been docking our
paychecks lately so that you</font>

17
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">could pay for shit like
this around the bar.</font>

18
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:38,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is nothing fixed?</font>

19
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, by the way, I never agreed
to let you dock my paycheck.</font>

20
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">That seems like something
we should all vote on.</font>

21
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:48,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It costs money to run this place and keep it main...
- Hey-oh!</font>

22
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, bitches?</font>

23
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the shit is this?</font>

24
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:53,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">New scooter.</font>

25
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:54,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">My surrogate money came in.</font>

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">30 G's, babies.</font>

27
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:57,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sweet. Where's our cut?</font>

28
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:58,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your cut?</font>

29
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, hey, Mac makes
a really good point.</font>

30
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we worked our asses off
on that baby scheme of yours.</font>

31
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:04,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us part of the
money that you made.</font>

32
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are
you talking about?</font>

33
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did nothing
for nine months.</font>

34
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

35
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't have pulled something
like that off without us.</font>

36
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they drove you to the
hospital, they picked you up.</font>

37
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was there, I recall.</font>

38
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I made all the contacts,
I pushed that little</font>

39
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:19,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">monkey out and now I'm going to
be claiming him as a dependent</font>

40
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">and getting tax breaks
for the next 18 years.</font>

41
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you talk about a scheme?</font>

42
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that for a long-term
scheme, bitches?</font>

43
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:32,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you guys all better eat a dick,
'cause Sweet Dee beat the system.</font>

46
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Get out.</font>

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been trying to
contact you for months.</font>

50
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:10,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you not received
any of our letters?</font>

51
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Letters? What is it, 1986?</font>

52
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't do letters, lady.</font>

53
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all digital.</font>

54
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you had opened up the
letters you would understand</font>

55
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:18,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're being audited.</font>

56
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:19,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audited?</font>

57
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:21,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
What are you talking about?</font>

58
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not scamming the government,
if that's what you're saying.</font>

59
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your license plate
says "$CAMMIN."</font>

60
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no.</font>

61
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:30,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean no?</font>

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

63
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:37,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I want to talk to you about
this dependent that you're</font>

64
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:41,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">claiming— this, uh,
Barnabas Reynolds.</font>

65
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I would love that.</font>

66
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would love that because I love
to talk about little Barney, I do.</font>

67
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:50,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now's not a great time,
you know what I mean?</font>

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I left him in the car—
with the window down of course.</font>

69
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hot.</font>

70
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hot, isn't it?</font>

71
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:58,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, is there a better time?</font>

72
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:00,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would 3:00 work?</font>

73
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">3:00 sounds great.</font>

74
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:04,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait for 3:00.</font>

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Frank, we need to talk.</font>

76
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:13,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want you making any major
bar decisions alone anymore.</font>

77
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're sleazy
and we don't trust you.</font>

78
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we want to vote
on things now, okay?</font>

79
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want a democracy.</font>

80
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that ain't gonna work.</font>

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you guys get really
emotional about everything.</font>

82
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:25,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll start arguing about shit
and nothing will get done.</font>

83
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:27,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know we're emotional people
and we've discussed that.</font>

84
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:28,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think we have a solution.</font>

85
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:32,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to have a daily meeting
where we will discuss all bar matters.</font>

86
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:35,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emotion will be suppressed
and reason will prevail.</font>

87
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reason will prevail!</font>

88
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, we decided also that
we would say "Reason will</font>

89
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">prevail," every time someone says...
Reason will prevail!</font>

90
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:43,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to say it
right now, because I'm just</font>

91
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:46,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">explaining to Frank that reason will prevail...
Reason will prevail!</font>

92
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, you don't have
to say it right now.</font>

93
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just explaining... If we're going to
say it, we're gonna say it every time.</font>

94
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:54,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you made up the rule...
Okay, I'll tell you what— I like this.</font>

95
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:55,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

96
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:56,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

97
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should definitely do this
to make everything fair.</font>

98
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything aboveboard.</font>

99
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go do it in there.</font>

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

101
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first meeting of Paddy's
congress shall commence henceforth.</font>

102
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, first order of business.</font>

103
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:09,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

104
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about how
Frank handles the money.</font>

105
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:11,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

106
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money, money, money, money, money, money...
Whoa, whoa.</font>

107
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we got to talk about the
money, but there are other</font>

108
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">issues that are pressing, too.</font>

109
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what, dude?</font>

110
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like one that comes to
mind is the dead dog.</font>

111
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:21,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">What dead dog?</font>

112
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:22,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dead dog in the alley.</font>

113
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been there
for about a week.</font>

114
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and we decided that Charlie
was going to throw it in the trash.</font>

115
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you decided that.</font>

116
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never got a vote.</font>

117
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:31,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Mac and I got to vote on
that, we would have voted to,</font>

118
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, you know, have
a proper dog burial.</font>

119
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a waste of
time and resources.</font>

120
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, hold on a
second there, Frank.</font>

121
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:40,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's put our new
process into action.</font>

122
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the guys should have a
opportunity to state their case</font>

123
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a rational and
unemotional way.</font>

124
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, you have the floor.</font>

125
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

126
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, sure. Easy.</font>

127
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. No problem.</font>

128
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:54,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay...
Uh, okay, sometimes dogs die.</font>

129
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

130
00:04:55,863 --> 00:05:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, dogs, uh...
die from cars sometimes.</font>

131
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes not.</font>

132
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's also... Disease.</font>

133
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:11,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's also disease
in America and abroad.</font>

134
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many dogs... Goddamn it!</font>

135
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how to express myself unless
through anger and personal attack!</font>

136
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:20,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting very upset, because
I'm not saying it right!</font>

137
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys, guys...
I want a dog funeral!</font>

138
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, calm down.</font>

139
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:27,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to step in here and I'm gonna
speak for you for a moment, if I may.</font>

140
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:29,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it's a good idea
for us to spend all of our</font>

141
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:32,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">hard-earned cash on some ornate
display for the disposal of</font>

142
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">what amounts to an
animal carcass.</font>

143
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">An animal that we never knew—
or had a relationship with.</font>

144
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm going to— I'm going to go
ahead and say that I think we</font>

145
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">should just throw
it in a Dumpster.</font>

146
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:43,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... But, but, but, we'll
have a candle on site.</font>

148
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll light it.</font>

149
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have a boom box there and
you guys can say a few words.</font>

150
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. I don't love it.</font>

151
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me neither.</font>

152
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:58,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that dog is turning into
hot soup out there in the sun.</font>

153
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

154
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank?</font>

155
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

156
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!</font>

157
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it works.</font>

158
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. See, Frank, we can get through
these issues and be unemotional about it.</font>

159
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one issue off the
docket right there.</font>

160
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:08,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next issue.</font>

161
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about the money.</font>

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money, okay... Oh, yes, we're going to
talk about the money, but we have a</font>

163
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:15,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">list of things on the docket
here that we've got to check off.</font>

164
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we're gonna do it right,
we're gonna do it right.</font>

165
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the next thing on the list
is limes and how we slice them.</font>

166
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thick or thin?</font>

167
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:23,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's talk about
the limes, guys.</font>

168
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll keep emotion out of it.</font>

169
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:24,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reason will prevail.</font>

170
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reason will prevail.</font>

171
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think the limes
should be cut a bit thinner.</font>

172
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

173
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thin limes?</font>

174
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">People will choke!</font>

175
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:32,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">People will die!</font>

176
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

177
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, Charlie, take
emotion out of it.</font>

178
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:35,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie's got a point.</font>

179
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the cornerstones of
Paddy's Pub is thick limes.</font>

180
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, don't tell me... I'm going to put
my thumb through your eye, you little</font>

181
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:41,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">bitch!</font>

182
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Shh.</font>

183
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay calm, stay...
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.</font>

184
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me, eh?</font>

185
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:46,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay calm with me, okay?</font>

186
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be unemotional.</font>

187
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's-Let's be democratic.</font>

188
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's put this thing to a vote.</font>

189
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">A vote?</font>

190
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">A vote solves everything in
a democracy, does it not?</font>

191
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:57,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

192
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:01,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, all for thinner limes,
raise your hands.</font>

193
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all for thicker limes,
raise your hands.</font>

194
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, there you go.</font>

195
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a democracy in action.</font>

196
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's two votes
against two votes.</font>

197
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">A perfect example of when
democracy has failed.</font>

198
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:27,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news, Dee!</font>

199
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have decided to occasionally
let you vote on some pressing</font>

200
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">matters in the bar
as we see fit.</font>

201
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

202
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you land on thick
limes or thin limes?</font>

203
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">And try and keep your emotions
out of it even though people</font>

204
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">could choke and die.</font>

205
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

206
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:41,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's, what's going on in here?</font>

207
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you having another baby?</font>

208
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, it's fine, okay?</font>

209
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have it all under control.</font>

210
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just, I'm getting audited.</font>

211
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:47,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audited? Oh, she's screwed.</font>

212
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the tax man?</font>

213
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

214
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not screwed.
I got it all under control, okay?</font>

215
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a handle on it.</font>

216
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got to find a baby
by 3:00 in the afternoon.</font>

217
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get out. Just get out now.</font>

218
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, a vote for thin limes would
get me out of your apartment.</font>

219
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:02,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better yet, a vote for thick
limes, I'll throw myself full</font>

220
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">force into this little
baby caper of yours.</font>

221
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need your help.</font>

222
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Dee, you need our
help, we need your help.</font>

223
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's work something out here.</font>

224
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:11,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know which stance you're
gonna do, and I don't wanna do it.</font>

225
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:12,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, stop standing like me.</font>

226
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, let's help
each other out, okay?</font>

227
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:15,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got an idea.</font>

228
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:18,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys go magically find me a
baby by 3:00 in the afternoon,</font>

229
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:21,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I'll-I'll help you
out with your lime problem.</font>

230
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

231
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:22,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

232
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:23,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

233
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get you a baby.</font>

234
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you want, we'll get you
a baby, no magic required.</font>

235
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:28,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many babies you need?</font>

236
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

237
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the one baby.</font>

238
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:31,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long? Couple hours?</font>

239
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:32,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">3:00 this afternoon.</font>

240
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.
How long you need it for?</font>

241
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want it for life or you...?</font>

242
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a short-time baby.</font>

243
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a short-time baby.</font>

244
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a short-time baby? Easy.</font>

245
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you guys,
this is so exciting!</font>

246
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is amazing!</font>

247
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea how
much you're helping me.</font>

248
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's see, um, all
right, I tell you what.</font>

249
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:51,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's how to handle
your lime situation.</font>

250
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has been decided.</font>

251
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:54,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are now the Pickle Party.</font>

252
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Dee has joined us.</font>

253
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are going to vote for pickles
in the bar instead of limes.</font>

254
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

255
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.</font>

256
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, our three votes
will always beat your two.</font>

257
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:05,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">We win, dude.</font>

258
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the winners, okay?</font>

259
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:08,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a beer with
a pickle in it.</font>

260
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what happens when you
three disagree with each other?</font>

261
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going to disagree.</font>

262
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the point of the Pickle Party,
we're very aligned on these issues.</font>

263
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:16,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, you can't just
start your own party.</font>

264
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to talk to people about...
Yes, you can.</font>

265
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:19,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can?</font>

266
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're not as educated or as
informed, what you do is you</font>

267
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">start your own party and
you yell the loudest.</font>

268
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want attention!</font>

269
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right, yeah, sure.</font>

270
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're the Pickle Party.</font>

271
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. Okay, so let's just
accept that and move on.</font>

272
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Frank, move on.</font>

273
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reason will prevail.</font>

274
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:34,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pickles will prevail!</font>

275
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:40,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, the next issue on our
list should be a pretty easy</font>

276
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">one for the Pickle
Party to agree on.</font>

277
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A crucifix in the bar."</font>

278
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, you are right,
this is an easy one.</font>

279
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't we have a
crucifix in the bar?</font>

280
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:52,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we're a bar.</font>

281
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:55,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, but we're an
Irish Catholic bar.</font>

282
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're an Irish bar.</font>

283
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Irish Catholic bar, and
therefore a giant wooden</font>

284
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">crucifix is a celebration
or our heritage.</font>

285
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giant?</font>

286
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

287
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">How big of a crucifix
do you want?</font>

288
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big. It should be the
centerpiece of the whole room.</font>

289
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it should dominate
every conversation.</font>

290
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gonna be terrifying!</font>

291
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be terrifying.</font>

292
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how you know God
loves you, Charlie.</font>

293
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:19,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want a giant bloody man in the
bar scaring the customers, and most</font>

294
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">importantly, me!</font>

295
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see that, Frank?</font>

296
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:21,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it.</font>

297
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just played them
like a fiddle.</font>

298
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:24,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">A goddamn fiddle.</font>

299
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:25,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

300
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want in on the action.</font>

301
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:31,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it is that you got going on
around here, I want a piece of it, okay?</font>

302
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:36,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Frank, you might not
know this, but you need me.</font>

303
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't trust you, Frank.</font>

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a piece of shit and
you're ugly and you ooze sleaze</font>

305
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're very, very ugly.</font>

306
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm gonna
make you my puppet.</font>

307
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here.</font>

308
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Puppet.</font>

309
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I've been cooking the
books in the bar for years.</font>

310
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I faking knew it.</font>

311
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, all kinds of avenues
and shell corporations.</font>

312
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:57,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all fake and
it's all in here.</font>

313
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.</font>

314
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out right there.</font>

315
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, holy shit.</font>

316
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what is this one?</font>

317
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:02,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wolf Cola"?</font>

318
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wolf Cola, that's a
bogus soda distributor.</font>

319
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it up. It's fake!</font>

320
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the whole idea is the more
corporations that you can plant offshore...</font>

321
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:13,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

322
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more money
you can rake in.</font>

323
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:18,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Da-da-da! I don't care about any
of these details, but I like</font>

324
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:19,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">these figures I'm seeing.</font>

325
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll be the puppet
and do my dance, and you can</font>

326
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep the goddamn
details to yourself.</font>

327
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:28,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh! I don't think I hear
any arguing out there.</font>

328
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we can have the crucifix, but it
needs to be in the back of the bar.</font>

329
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:36,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? I can live with that.</font>

330
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a compromise
right there, man.</font>

331
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!
Pickle Party compromise!</font>

332
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh-huh-huh!
Tasteful crucifix party.</font>

333
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey-hey-hey, all right!</font>

334
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like you guys
came to a compromise.</font>

335
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great. We cross the
crucifix issue off the list.</font>

336
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">One quick question
before I do, though.</font>

337
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">How bloody is this guy gonna be?</font>

338
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not bloody at all.</font>

339
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very bloody.</font>

340
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:55,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

341
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gotta be drenched in blood.</font>

342
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, covered in blood.</font>

343
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

344
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:00,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's the whole point.</font>

345
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to see the
wounds of Christ.</font>

346
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to be ravaged.</font>

347
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, dude, it's bad enough
I'm gonna let you put the</font>

348
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:07,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">stupid cross up in the first first place...
Stupid cross?</font>

349
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:08,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch, I knew it!</font>

350
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:09,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it! I knew it!</font>

351
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:10,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make fun!</font>

352
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:11,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole point!</font>

353
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:12,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it peaceful-like!</font>

354
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:13,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a massacre!</font>

355
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:14,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing peaceful.</font>

356
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to
look at a massacre!</font>

357
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:24,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, according to our records,
you are claiming a dependent</font>

358
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">for which you have no
official documentation.</font>

359
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

360
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

361
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sweating profusely.</font>

362
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:46,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, yes, yes, I, um,
I'm just very worried.</font>

363
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the babysitters were
supposed to bring the baby back</font>

364
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">by 3:00, and where are you?</font>

365
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you guys?</font>

366
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:56,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

367
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crying baby!</font>

368
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crying baby here!</font>

369
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

370
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's my sweet baby.</font>

371
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, won't you?</font>

372
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Let's go.</font>

373
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, you found a baby!</font>

374
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:07,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find a baby?</font>

375
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys, I love you so much.
Where...?</font>

376
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Dee, which crucifix
do you find more tasteful?</font>

377
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:15,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are out of your goddamn minds?</font>

378
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this? Where's the baby?</font>

379
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:19,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really want a kidnapping on top
of all the other shit you got going on</font>

380
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">right now?</font>

381
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a plan! We had a plan!</font>

382
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's totally buying it, okay?</font>

383
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Make a decision.</font>

384
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but for how long?</font>

385
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could be out
there for for hours.</font>

386
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have to produce
a real baby!</font>

387
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop thinking about your problems and
start thinking about our problems.</font>

388
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, calm down, calm down.</font>

389
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:35,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so emotional right now.</font>

390
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so wet, too.</font>

391
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill you.</font>

392
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:40,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, just shut up for
a second, let me think.</font>

393
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, yes, go to the bar.</font>

394
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll get me out of here and buy me
some time to get this bitch off my balls.</font>

395
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye!</font>

396
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very, very sick baby.</font>

397
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very sick baby!</font>

398
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so sad when they don't
feel well, isn't it?</font>

399
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:52,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock up, won't you,
on your way out?</font>

400
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let's definitely reschedule.</font>

401
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:56,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do. Shh!</font>

402
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, yeah, so I was thinking
about my title, because I think</font>

403
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">it should be "Vice President
of Worldwide Disibution."</font>

404
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't need a title.</font>

405
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:10,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I need you to do for the next three
weeks is to deflect Mac and Charlie.</font>

406
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's easy.</font>

407
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do that, Frank.</font>

408
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm good at.</font>

409
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I am gonna need a business
card, 'cause I want to be able</font>

410
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hand that shit to people, so they
know that I am in a place of power.</font>

411
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not important.</font>

412
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's important to me, Frank!</font>

413
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know that what's important
to you is money and power, but I</font>

414
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">want real power, because
with real power comes real</font>

415
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">responsibility, and I don't
want any of that shit.</font>

416
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want the money.</font>

417
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the illusion of power.</font>

418
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">And puss.</font>

419
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

420
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, I don't know, Frank.</font>

421
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:39,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, man.</font>

422
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

423
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, tell me.</font>

424
00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:44,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something.</font>

425
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I got this, uh...
this giant gaping hole inside me.</font>

426
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:50,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

427
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm-I'm always trying
to fill it with something.</font>

428
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:00,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to call it my,
uh, my God hole.</font>

429
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:01,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

430
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:05,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think a lot of people in this
world, they-they fill it with religion.</font>

431
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:06,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't believe in God.</font>

432
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you want to
fill it with pussy.</font>

433
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

434
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo!</font>

435
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dennis and Frank, you here?</font>

436
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:13,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, oh, oh!</font>

437
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:17,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Guys, we got to help Dee
with her tax audit situation.</font>

438
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Dennis, please, if you
could take the floor.</font>

439
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-Wait, wait.</font>

440
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">What tax audit situation?</font>

441
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right.</font>

442
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:25,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so Dee's baby scheme blew up in
her face and now she's getting audited.</font>

443
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:28,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, did you tell
the IRS you work here?</font>

444
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I did.</font>

445
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't have the IRS
looking around our books.</font>

446
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:32,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

447
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with our books?</font>

448
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:33,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me step in here.</font>

449
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:36,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I think what you're trying
to say is that the IRS poking</font>

450
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">around our bar business
is no good for anyone.</font>

451
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's gonna be best for all of
us to get the IRS off of Dee's back.</font>

452
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

453
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:47,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, as the only rational and
emotionless person here, I'm</font>

454
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">gonna tell you guys
what we need to do.</font>

455
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:54,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, you've all been trying to convince
the IRS that Dee's baby is alive.</font>

456
00:15:54,116 --> 00:16:00,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you really need to be doing is
convincing the IRS that Dee's baby is dead.</font>

457
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is dark.</font>

458
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darkest thing we've ever done.</font>

459
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

460
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hello.</font>

461
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for Dee Reynolds.</font>

462
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

463
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't you have a seat please?</font>

464
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

465
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:26,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby croaked.</font>

466
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes.</font>

467
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

468
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane, right?</font>

469
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:34,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

470
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, this definitely feels like
emotion trumping reason, correct?</font>

471
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

472
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:42,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, dude, I'm sorry, but is
this the size you had in mind?</font>

473
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

474
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:44,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too big.</font>

475
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:45,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not too big.</font>

476
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should just be happy I
didn't spray it down yet.</font>

477
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not getting
any more blood.</font>

478
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

479
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He was my sweet angel..."</font>

480
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Dee, here we go.</font>

481
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's showtime. Are you ready?</font>

482
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I have a couple questions.</font>

483
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:56,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

484
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting nervous, Dennis,
'cause I don't think I can do</font>

485
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">the speech that you wrote.</font>

486
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me hear some of it.</font>

487
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, and this is the thing, I-I
can't, I can't cry on command.</font>

488
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, Dee.</font>

489
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, how are you planning
on becoming an actress at all?</font>

490
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't make people laugh, 'cause you're
not funny, you can't cry on command.</font>

491
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:10,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can you do?</font>

492
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I can try harder, but it's just that...
All right, well, the good</font>

493
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">news is I anticipated this, so I brought...
What's that?</font>

494
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bit of chili powder.</font>

495
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna blow this directly into
your eyes, and trust me, you'll cry.</font>

496
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, is that safe though?</font>

497
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this...?</font>

498
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's, you know,
it's safe enough.</font>

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's give it a try, shall we?</font>

500
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

501
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:28,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh-shh-shh.</font>

502
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

503
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:30,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

504
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:31,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh-shh-shh.</font>

505
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, listen, listen, listen.</font>

506
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:33,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it, save it!</font>

507
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:34,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're starting.</font>

508
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:35,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

509
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:35,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're starting, Dee.</font>

510
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:36,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break a leg.</font>

511
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

512
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:47,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really heavy.</font>

513
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did Frank put in there?</font>

514
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:49,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">The urinal rocks.</font>

515
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:50,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

516
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming in handy, huh?</font>

517
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

518
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:56,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is a very sad day for
the entire Paddy's Pub family.</font>

519
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:57,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

520
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:04,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">At times like this, I-I like to quench
my thirst with a delicious Wolf Cola.</font>

521
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing like that...
to wash away the sorrow.</font>

522
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear, hear.</font>

523
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:13,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my bit.</font>

524
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:17,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's time for the
grieving mother.</font>

525
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:20,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... oh.</font>

526
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, everyone.</font>

527
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:22,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, God.</font>

528
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much for coming.</font>

529
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's such a sad day, isn't it?</font>

530
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:30,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, little Barney.</font>

531
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were my special angel.</font>

532
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">And only angels can fly.</font>

533
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good God. Sorry.</font>

534
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:36,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sob.</font>

535
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sob, you bitch.</font>

536
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it hurts!</font>

537
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it hurts!</font>

538
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pain inside.</font>

539
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it hurts so bad.</font>

540
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:47,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

541
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, I'm sorry.</font>

542
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:49,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

543
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:50,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Dee.</font>

544
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I just...</font>

545
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are my eyes bleeding?</font>

546
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:54,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, is there blood?</font>

547
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Oh!</font>

548
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there blood?</font>

549
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch!</font>

550
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

551
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavy stuff, guys.</font>

552
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:02,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavy stuff, heavy
subject matter.</font>

553
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:07,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, uh, Barney,
you died too young.</font>

554
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you could walk.</font>

555
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you could talk.</font>

556
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:15,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">And before you had the chance
to get together the proper</font>

557
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:21,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">paperwork, all that paperwork that you
need to prove— Oh, thank you so much.</font>

558
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:24,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wolf Cola, everyone.</font>

559
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the right
cola for closure.</font>

560
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:30,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about closure, 'cause that...
Can I talk to you for a second?</font>

561
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

562
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, something stinks.</font>

563
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I know.</font>

564
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you noticed that all we wanted to
do was talk about our money... Right.</font>

565
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we kept getting pushed
into talking about other things?</font>

566
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:42,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then when we leave, Frank and
Dennis became all buddy-buddy.</font>

567
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there were a lot of backroom
dealings going on in here, you know?</font>

568
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

569
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:51,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dennis Reynolds, Executive Vice
President of Worldwide Distribution.</font>

570
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wolf Cola."</font>

571
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, dude?</font>

572
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, now I'm getting pissed off,
you know, 'cause I think those</font>

573
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">two are conspiring against us.</font>

574
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go out there and expose these
sons of bitches for who they are.</font>

575
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:04,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the most important thing to
remember is that this whole</font>

576
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">thing is over, right?</font>

577
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:07,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

578
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single person in
this room has to move on.</font>

579
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:11,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's excellent.</font>

580
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:12,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent, Dennis.</font>

581
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, thank you.</font>

582
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we would like to pay our
respects to the dead baby.</font>

583
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the Christian tradition,
we're gonna open up the casket</font>

584
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take one last look
at his tiny corpse.</font>

585
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to do that.</font>

586
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is happening?</font>

587
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what you get when you
mess with the Pickle Party.</font>

588
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pickle Party.</font>

589
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare for your hearts
to turn to stones!</font>

590
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">God.</font>

591
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

592
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the dead dog
from the alleyway.</font>

593
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was compromising.</font>

594
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured we'd give
it a proper burial.</font>

595
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

596
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,978
