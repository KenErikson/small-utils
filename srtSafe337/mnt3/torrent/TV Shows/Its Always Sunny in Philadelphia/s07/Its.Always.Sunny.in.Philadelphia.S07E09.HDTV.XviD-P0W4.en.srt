<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, damn it, damn it!</font>

00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is such a stupid
goddamn situation.</font>

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to get
out of here, Dennis.</font>

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to get out of here.</font>

5
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:18,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a plan.</font>

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, plan one is for you
to lower your goddamn voice.</font>

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:24,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is as low as I go, okay?</font>

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:27,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we bum-rush her and choke
her out with her own belt.</font>

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you're escalating shit.</font>

10
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly what I'm talking about.</font>

11
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">We immediately escalate
everything to a ten.</font>

12
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ridiculous.</font>

13
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, somebody comes in with
some preposterous plan or idea.</font>

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then all of a sudden,
everybody's on the gas.</font>

15
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's on the brakes.</font>

16
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's thinking.</font>

17
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody's just talking over each other
with one idiotic idea after another.</font>

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until, finally, we find
ourselves in a situation where</font>

19
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've broken into somebody's house.</font>

20
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:48,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the homeowner is home.</font>

21
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:49,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes.</font>

22
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:50,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of it, Dee.</font>

23
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

24
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:51,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't do this anymore.</font>

25
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:52,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to examine our process.</font>

27
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

28
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on board with that, okay?</font>

29
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:57,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">But right now I'm trying
to come up with solutions.</font>

30
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you don't want to choke
her out, we won't choke her out.</font>

31
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:01,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you need to help me come
up with a plan, okay?</font>

32
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because this is breaking and entering.</font>

33
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

34
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, your breath is hideous.</font>

35
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it smells bad.</font>

36
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:08,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

37
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

38
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,555

our heads this time.</font>

totally avoidable situation.</font>

49
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:53,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a very persuasive speech.</font>

50
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she's packing a suitcase.</font>

51

quadruple onions on your burger.</font>

you have been dragged?</font>

56
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,999

00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, extraction team.</font>

70
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your status?</font>

71
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:30,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you recovered the artifact yet?</font>

72
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

73
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:32,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are off the artifact plan.</font>

74
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not doing the
artifact plan anymore.</font>

75
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a stupid plan.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Negative, negative.</font>

77
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is an awesome plan, okay?</font>

78
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">This family should not
have the artifact.</font>

79
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:44,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">It belongs in a museum.</font>

80
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:45,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Belongs in a museum, bro.</font>

81
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adults should not be making plans
that are based on dumb movies!</font>

82
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

83
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:54,074
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Indiana Jones</i> is a dumb movie?</font>

84
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I like the first one.</font>

85
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:55,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

86
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:56,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I like him as a character.</font>

87
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:57,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Come on.</font>

88
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But some of the mov— Okay, listen...
It's not about that.</font>

89
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying that the plan
was genuinely dumb, as many of</font>

90
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">our plans are, I now realize.</font>

91
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about your whole speech
about "I have the grace of a</font>

92
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:09,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">falcon, and I'll be in and
out like a demon's whisper"?</font>

93
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you stood up on your chair
in that burger restaurant</font>

94
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">and said that speech for everybody!</font>

95
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a damn good speech.</font>

96
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:16,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was very persuasive.</font>

97
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I regret it now.
I got to pee.</font>

98
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

99
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, Dee, what-what are you doing?</font>

100
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could come back in
here at any moment.</font>

101
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what...
<i>Indiana Jones: Part 4</i> was dumb.</font>

102
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you that, yeah.</font>

103
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't even count it.</font>

104
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna say <i>Temple of</i>
<i>Doom's</i> out for me, as well.</font>

105
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:30,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it out for you?</font>

106
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's also dumb.</font>

107
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I liked that one.</font>

108
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:35,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Um, guys, can we
talk about this later?</font>

109
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, let's go.</font>

110
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're bailing.</font>

111
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:41,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't going nowhere
until I get that vase.</font>

112
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:42,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget about the vase, Frank.</font>

113
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're bailing on the vase, okay?</font>

114
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank's right actually, okay?</font>

115
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to thing about the vase.</font>

116
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to think about
what's best for the vase.</font>

117
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are men of honor who protect
artifacts from those who steal them.</font>

118
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

119
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't give a shit about
artifacts two hours ago.</font>

120
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what? Now we do.</font>

121
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what's that have
to do with anything?</font>

122
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we should not be
committing crimes based on</font>

123
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:00,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">beliefs that are two hours old.</font>

124
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then don't read us
newspaper articles about stolen</font>

125
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">artifacts that outrage us.</font>

126
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">That article was about how the
museum is holding an auction</font>

127
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">to raise money, okay?</font>

128
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing was stolen.</font>

129
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vase is not stolen.</font>

130
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, as a matter of fact, only
if we follow through with</font>

131
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">this plan will the vase be stolen.</font>

132
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you were the ones who escalated
us off of being the extraction team.</font>

133
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could have gotten
in and out of there.</font>

134
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, escalate your way back
in, for all I give a shit.</font>

135
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:21,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving. I quit.</font>

136
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:22,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

137
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:23,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm still in.</font>

138
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Living on the edge.</font>

139
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:25,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's making me feel alive.</font>

140
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

141
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

142
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, now, Frank, that is why you
are on the extraction team.</font>

143
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank's got the attitude, Dennis
has the grace... Dee nosed in.</font>

144
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:33,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">She nosed in.</font>

145
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:36,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee was dragged.</font>

146
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

147
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:41,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extraction team, there is an SUV
pulling up in front of the house.</font>

148
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:42,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a man getting out.</font>

149
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I cannot see the driver's
face, but the subject</font>

150
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:49,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">appears to have pointed
feet of some kind.</font>

151
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm repeating here.</font>

152
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has pointed feet, so careful now.</font>

153
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:53,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

154
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:54,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

155
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wearing cowboy boots.</font>

156
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yes, I'm seeing now that
they are cowboy— you know,</font>

157
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:01,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">- his feet could be pointed on the inside, so let's be..
- They're definitely not</font>

158
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:02,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">pointed on the inside.</font>

159
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

160
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

161
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're definitely not— I mean,
I guess I can't say for sure.</font>

162
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know that for sure.</font>

163
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart?</font>

164
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You home?</font>

165
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:09,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up here, darling!</font>

166
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

167
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she coming back up here?</font>

168
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is she coming back up here?</font>

169
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, back in the closet.</font>

170
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yippee-I-ki-yay.</font>

171
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

172
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

173
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I just saw her put the
vase in the suitcase.</font>

174
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

175
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

176
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:30,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can barely even tell if
that's a person and a suitcase.</font>

177
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to pee so bad.</font>

178
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, your breath is dog shit.</font>

179
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

180
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing home?</font>

181
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I got a call from
the alarm company.</font>

182
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said it was the house.</font>

183
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bad.</font>

184
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I must have set if off.</font>

185
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just popped by to grab a jacket.</font>

186
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you you'd be chilly.</font>

187
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're always right
about that, honey.</font>

188
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:49,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I got an appointment, you know.</font>

189
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:50,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

190
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I'm heading back to the office.</font>

191
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:52,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, sugar.</font>

192
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

193
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

194
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very strange.</font>

195
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:56,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was close.</font>

196
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:57,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a chip.</font>

197
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

198
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my chips.</font>

199
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get a chip.</font>

200
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:01,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on in there?</font>

201
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:04,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Basically, these people are Southern,
and the lady lied to the man.</font>

202
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they gone?</font>

203
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

204
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just quietly get out.</font>

205
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's phase time, bitches.</font>

206
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What?</font>

207
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

208
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, Frank?</font>

209
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:16,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are in a very dangerous
situation here.</font>

210
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people are from the South.</font>

211
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:18,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird.</font>

212
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">People from the South don't
usually move up North.</font>

213
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, they come up.</font>

214
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:24,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">These carpetbaggers come up by the
truckloads just to steal our artifacts.</font>

215
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:24,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carpetbaggers, huh?</font>

216
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

217
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a chip.</font>

218
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:27,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't get chips, Charlie!</font>

219
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, God only knows what these
people will do to us if they catch us.</font>

220
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">These Southerners, they probably pray
for a home invasion every single day.</font>

221
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't wait to get their
hands on home invaders, so they</font>

222
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:38,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">can blast them with shotguns and-and,
uh, do God knows what to them, Frank.</font>

223
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be lucky if the only thing
that happens is we go to jail.</font>

224
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have got to go.</font>

225
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, if some hillbilly comes up
to me, I'm gonna lash him in</font>

226
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:45,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">the face, that's all.</font>

227
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Frank.</font>

228
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are always armed to the teeth.</font>

229
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will hogtie us and hang us out on
the front lawn or burn us on a cross.</font>

230
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, man.</font>

231
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to be careful.</font>

232
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:55,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, anytime you find out,
like, some dude's got a crazy</font>

233
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">torture basement or something,
it's someone from the South.</font>

234
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:58,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It always is.</font>

235
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, extraction team,
why don't you go down to</font>

236
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">the basement and see if it's
some kind of crazy type dungeon.</font>

237
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

238
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dungeons and tons of guns and—
dude, please give me a chip.</font>

239
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not getting shit, okay?</font>

240
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:08,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

241
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave it alone with the chips.</font>

242
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanted chips, you could've
gotten a bag at the hamburger store.</font>

243
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ask me again!</font>

244
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't listen to this shit anymore.</font>

245
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

246
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Q-tip holder.</font>

247
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

248
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:19,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, problem solved.</font>

249
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:20,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just get out of here?</font>

250
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, wait, wait.</font>

251
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, hold on.</font>

252
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you need to see this.</font>

253
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you are nosing in.</font>

254
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nip it in the bud.</font>

255
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">A whole bunch of tickets to
<i>The Jay Leno Show.</i></font>

256
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?</font>

257
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Listen to me.</font>

258
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to see Jay Leno 15, 16 times?</font>

259
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:32,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one.</font>

260
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:33,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one wants to see him once.</font>

261
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">At all, right?</font>

262
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:35,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a theory.</font>

263
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's banging Leno.</font>

264
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's having an affair with Leno.</font>

265
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, if she was banging Jay
Leno, why would she have to buy</font>

266
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bunch of tickets to his show?</font>

267
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's stupid, Frank.</font>

268
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use your head.</font>

269
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:45,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got an idea, though.</font>

270
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's trying to kill him.</font>

271
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:48,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's still very upset about
the whole Conan thing.</font>

272
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:49,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

273
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it— she's icing Leno.</font>

274
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's packing her suitcase.</font>

275
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's sneaking away from her husband.</font>

276
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:54,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.</font>

277
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the theories of lunatics.</font>

278
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,625
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay.</i></font>

279
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have got to get to
get out of here now.</font>

280
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he's right. Let's go.</font>

281
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Back off, bitch.</font>

282
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't leaving until I get that vase.</font>

283
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:06,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it! Stop it.</font>

284
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:07,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna hurt himself.</font>

285
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never should have let
him have that whip.</font>

286
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">For God sake, let's
just get out of here.</font>

287
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:11,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, come on.</font>

288
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think
the back door's this way.</font>

289
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:31,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch, I am
not getting hogtied over your lack of grace.</font>

290
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope they hogtie you.</font>

291
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I hope they rape you in
their basement for ten years.</font>

292
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, listen to me.</font>

293
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

294
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,467
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm telling you, I have a
weird feeling about this.</i></font>

295
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,671
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He just randomly comes home with
some story about the alarm.</i></font>

296
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,106
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He knows something.</i></font>

297
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,740
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Look, we should just do it now.</i></font>

298
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,741
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Pull the trigger.</i></font>

299
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:51,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull the trigger?</font>

300
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:52,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

301
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:53,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she talking to?</font>

302
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is she talking about
pulling the trigger on?</font>

303
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

304
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, until now, I was
thinking this Southern violence</font>

305
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">talk was just, you know, bull shit.</font>

306
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just an escalation of some kind.</font>

307
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:03,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

308
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I think it might not
be, you know what I mean?</font>

309
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

310
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, who is she
talking to right now?</font>

311
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that person?</font>

312
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna pull the trigger on somebody?
Jesus Christ.</font>

313
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm only asking because I
think knowing this might help</font>

314
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:12,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">us get out of this mess.</font>

315
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm saying?</font>

316
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:14,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Mm-hmm.</font>

317
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on with you, Dee?</font>

318
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be nosing into
this like crazy right now.</font>

319
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:19,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hold it anymore.</font>

320
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

321
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">The toilet's right behind you, so I'm
just gonna go ahead and pee in it.</font>

322
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no.</font>

323
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are just gonna intentionally
spray DNA all over the crime crime.</font>

324
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna spray anything anywhere.</font>

325
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you not familiar with
how a woman urinates?</font>

326
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:32,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am, Dee, but you
cannot flush the toilet.</font>

327
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to make too much noise.</font>

328
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:35,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're just gonna have
a bowl full of evidence.</font>

329
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, you've got a really
good point, but I'm going</font>

330
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do it anyway, okay, so it's
it's happening, it's happening.</font>

331
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do it, you can't do it, no.</font>

332
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:41,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening. Watch me.</font>

333
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. You are all liabilities.</font>

334
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you nose your way into this?
I hate you.</font>

335
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okaym, I'm gonna go find Mac
ad Charlie so they create a</font>

336
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">diversion so we can get
the hell out of here.</font>

337
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:49,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't pee with me in the room!</font>

338
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, yeah, go ahead and go.</font>

339
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you, God.</font>

340
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac? Charlie? Come in.</font>

341
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac? Charlie?</font>

342
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:00,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, Charlie, the
situation is out of control.</font>

343
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get out of
here while we still can.</font>

344
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:03,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without the guys?</font>

345
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:04,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they're as good as dead.</font>

346
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no telling what those
Southern people are gonna do to them.</font>

347
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:08,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, man.</font>

348
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:09,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

349
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should just get the hell out of
here, and I mean out of Philadelphia.</font>

350
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we should just drive and
drive and drive and not look back.</font>

351
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go to Arizona and open
up that imported leather shop</font>

352
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:18,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we've always talked about.</font>

353
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, the leathers, yes—
the tasseled leathers, the</font>

354
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">turquoise studs on the leathers.</font>

355
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the leather.</font>

356
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:23,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

357
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, do you
have the keys on you?</font>

358
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:26,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let's get the keys.</font>

359
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let't s get the keys.</font>

360
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get out of here.</font>

361
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, hey, I heard all that.</font>

362
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:32,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you holding down the button?</font>

363
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:33,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an accident.</font>

364
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't...
It was just sort of a reflex.</font>

365
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're always holding that thing down, and...
What? I'm...</font>

366
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:38,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, sorry, extraction team.</font>

367
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were having a leather conversation.</font>

368
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're-We're... Doesn't really...
Hey, um, what's the status on the vase?</font>

369
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not take off on us!</font>

370
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I repeat, do not take off on us.</font>

371
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leather shop in Arizona?</font>

372
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious?</font>

373
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are far too many leather
shops in Arizona as it is.</font>

374
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would be out of
business in a week's time.</font>

375
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you expect us to do, okay?</font>

376
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got us all freaked out in
here, sitting here waiting for</font>

377
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Southerners to tie us up to
horses and then have them run in</font>

378
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">opposite directions, ripping us apart.</font>

379
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:03,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

380
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we not supposed to fantasize about
opening up imported leather shops in</font>

381
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arizona?</font>

382
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:07,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, give me a chip.</font>

383
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not getting the chips.</font>

384
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chips are off the table, okay?</font>

385
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:12,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a chip!</font>

386
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't bring up the chips.</font>

387
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a chip.</font>

388
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants chips, and I asked him in
the store, Dennis, you were there.</font>

389
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:18,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "Charlie, do you
want a bag of chips?"</font>

390
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, "No, I don't want chips."</font>

391
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:21,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanted the goddamn chami,
you should have gotten the</font>

392
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">goddamn chips at the hamburger shop!</font>

393
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, calm down, calm down, listen.</font>

394
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need the two of you to create a
diversion so that we can sneak</font>

395
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of the house.</font>

396
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just flushed the toilet.</font>

397
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, fine, it's just—
fine, I'm just hungry.</font>

398
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll do a diversion.</font>

399
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, I just thought of something.</font>

400
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

401
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if this vase is cursed, okay?</font>

402
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that's why things
aren't going well, right?</font>

403
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this vase has a curse on it,
you do not want to touch it.</font>

404
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I repeat, do not touch
this vase if you see it.</font>

405
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick it up with, like, you know what?</font>

406
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:53,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a bag of sand of some sort and...
Get, get Dee to touch it.</font>

407
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Dee there?</font>

408
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you find Dee...
Are you still talking about the vase?</font>

409
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:57,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vase is not cursed.</font>

410
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:58,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from the 1800s.</font>

411
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a time of science.</font>

412
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, Dee, why did
you flush the toilet?</font>

413
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you had me all freaked out
about spray and DNA evidence.</font>

414
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-What's going on with Mac and Charlie?</font>

415
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's— I can't get
them to stay focused.</font>

416
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">They keep escalating the
conversation into evil curses</font>

417
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and opening leather shops in Arizona.</font>

418
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:13,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">A leather shop in Arizona?</font>

419
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

420
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they'd be out of
business in a week's time.</font>

421
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly what I said.</font>

422
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to split 'em up.</font>

423
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good idea.</font>

424
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you propose we do that?</font>

425
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Charlie, hey, it's Dee.</font>

426
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, uh, how come Mac's the
only one who gets to push the</font>

427
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">button on the walkie?</font>

428
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:37,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, let me get back to you on that.</font>

429
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you guys?</font>

430
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in a little girl's room.</font>

431
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:50,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, get back here.</font>

432
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac and Charlie are
gonna do a diversion.</font>

433
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:53,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

434
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:55,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little bitch has got a suitcase.</font>

435
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet the vase is in it.</font>

436
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I doubt that.</font>

437
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, at this point, I
doubt that this is even the</font>

438
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">family mentioned in the article.</font>

439
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:06,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frilly little dress, pink nightie.</font>

440
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy hell.</font>

441
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:11,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a teddy bear and it's
got something hard in it.</font>

442
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:16,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet the wife put the vase in the
teddy bear to steal it from the husband.</font>

443
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, that is absolute insanity.</font>

444
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:19,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna gut this thing.</font>

445
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

446
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, n-n-no, Frank.</font>

447
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.</font>

448
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.</font>

449
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.</font>

00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:30,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

451
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.</font>

452
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut, shut up.</font>

453
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is outrageous.</font>

454
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is an outrageous amount of noise.</font>

455
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert, I love you.</font>

456
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's loud.</font>

457
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, oh, I'll smother it.</font>

458
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:41,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Frank, do not.</font>

459
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:42,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fra, stop it.</font>

460
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm
Albert, I love you.</font>

461
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Albert... Are you kidding me?</font>

462
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:51,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

463
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">How have we not been
caught at this point?</font>

464
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up, guys?</font>

465
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, what are you doing here?</font>

466
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:01,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I snuck in.</font>

467
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac was, like, being a dick
about the walkie-talkie.</font>

468
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how, like, he wouldn't
let me push the button and stuff?</font>

469
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dick.</font>

470
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he can just sneak in, but
we can't seem to sneak out?</font>

471
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:12,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't easy— there's, like,
a ton of closets in this house.</font>

472
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know which
closet you were in, okay?</font>

473
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to look in a lot.</font>

474
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, now that we've
split you two idiots up,</font>

475
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe we can finally get
Mac to do a diversion.</font>

476
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mama, I'm home.</font>

477
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:24,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, now there's
a kid in the house?</font>

478
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, dude, a kid just walked into
the house— a little heads up!</font>

479
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you hold on one second, Dennis?</font>

480
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so that's a double-double
cheeseburger meal with a extra-large</font>

481
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">chocolate shake?</font>

482
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:37,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, can you go ahead and throw an extra
double cheeseburger on there, please?</font>

483
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I'm very hungry.</font>

484
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:42,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, now is not the time to
run off and get a hamburger!</font>

485
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your help!</font>

486
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't just run off, dude.</font>

487
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming back.</font>

488
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you to come back now.</font>

489
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you to create a diversion.</font>

490
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:49,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have got to get out of this house!</font>

491
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to Charlie's diversion?</font>

492
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie doesn't know what a
diversion is, apparently.</font>

493
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just ran directly into the house.</font>

494
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. I'll be right back.</font>

495
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great, thank you.</font>

496
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, get chips this time.</font>

497
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna get chips!</font>

498
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got mad at me for not... Shut up.</font>

499
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:03,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know what?</font>

500
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:04,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be a plumber.</font>

501
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll knock on the front door,
tell 'em I got a deal on pipes,</font>

502
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">you guys run out the back.</font>

503
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:11,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a little elaborate, but okay.</font>

504
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I'll do a Swedish accent!</font>

505
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you do not do a Swedish accent—
you don't know how to do one.</font>

506
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't need to, dude.</font>

507
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people don't know who you are!</font>

508
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't just tell them that we're there
to steal their artifact, Dennis.</font>

509
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a huge amount of middle
ground between those two things.</font>

510
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Swedish
plumber— I'm here to fix your pipes.</font>

511
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

512
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good accent.</font>

513
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do a Philadelphia accent if you
insist on doing an accent.</font>

514
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to do a
Philadelphia accent.</font>

515
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna do a Swedish accent,
because that's what Indy would do.</font>

516
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still
there, Dennis, are you still there?</font>

517
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it, and
don't worry about anything.</font>

518
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill you.</font>

519
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill you!</font>

520
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guys, looks like
we're on our own.</font>

521
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just make our move.</font>

522
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, how'd you sneak in here?</font>

523
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:53,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Front door.</font>

524
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just... Front door?</font>

525
00:15:55,578 --> 00:16:00,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just walked right
in the front door?</font>

526
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I ran, I had a little hustle
going, but yeah, front door.</font>

527
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

528
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm beginning to think we
should just walk right out</font>

529
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">the front door, then.</font>

530
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:12,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm beginning to think that this
family has zero awareness</font>

531
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:13,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">of their surroundings.</font>

532
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Let's just go.</font>

533
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

534
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,668
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So,
tell me, Madison, do you like</i></font>

535
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,602
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Disneyland?</i></font>

536
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,337
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah.</i></font>

537
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,575
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, we are going there right now.
Surprise!</i></font>

538
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:26,976
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I already packed your suitcase.</i></font>

539
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,478
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Did you pack Binky?</i></font>

540
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,746
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, no, I packed Elbert.</i></font>

541
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,381
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't want Elbert.</i></font>

542
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,749
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I want Binky!</i></font>

543
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,151
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Go grab your Binky and hurry
up, 'cause we got to go!</i></font>

544
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,419
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Frank, Frank!</i></font>

545
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:38,421
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Frank! Little girl coming your way.</i></font>

546
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,751
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm gonna whip this little
bitch in the face if she makes a a peep.</i></font>

547
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:48,736
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Binky?</i></font>

548
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Binky?</i></font>

549
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,467
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Binky!</i></font>

550
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are assholes.</font>

551
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one is planning to murder
Jay Leno or anyone else.</font>

552
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a nice woman planning a
surprise California vacation.</font>

553
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:07,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dangerous family? No.</font>

554
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,752
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Barry! What took you so long?</i></font>

555
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,872
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mom, how come Barry's here?</i></font>

556
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:20,976
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, well, uh, he's coming with us
to Disneyland instead of Daddy.</i></font>

557
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,546
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How'd
you like it if we could go to</i></font>

558
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Disneyland every day?</i></font>

559
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,783
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Are we going to California?</i></font>

560
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:27,484
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Without Daddy?</i></font>

561
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,852
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, I'll be your new daddy.</i></font>

562
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

563
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:32,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, did you hear that?</font>

564
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's out there, and they're
all going to Disneyland.</font>

565
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,997
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Barry, I
followed you, you son of a bitch.</i></font>

566

582
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just walk right out.</font>

583
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,869
