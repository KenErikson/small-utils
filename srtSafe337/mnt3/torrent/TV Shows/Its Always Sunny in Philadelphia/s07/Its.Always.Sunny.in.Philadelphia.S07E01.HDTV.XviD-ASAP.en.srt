<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, South
Philadelphia Animal Shelter.</font>

2
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:11,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, hello, I would like
to apply for an adoption, please.</font>

3
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:13,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what are
you guys talking about?</font>

4
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're adopting a
dog-fighting pit bull.</font>

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna keep it in
the bar, all right?</font>

6
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:18,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why wasn't I
consulted about this?</font>

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because last time we tried to
get a junkyard dog, we wound up</font>

8
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting a junkyard cat, and that's
exactly where you're gonna go with it.</font>

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:24,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

10
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:26,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't want some
goddamn snarling hellhound</font>

11
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:28,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">running around inside of our bar!</font>

12
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:29,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you crazy?</font>

13
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're going to
rehabilitate the dog, okay?</font>

14
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want it to
attack other dogs.</font>

15
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we would like for
it to attack people.</font>

16
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it attacks a person, great!</font>

17
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And, if the dog— or when
the dog— bites a customer,</font>

18
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">that person then can go home and have
a great story for their friends.</font>

19
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a win-win for everybody.</font>

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true!</font>

21
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go, like, "Dude, I got
bit a pit bull in a bar."</font>

22
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Paddy's! It was awesome!</font>

23
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome! And if you're an intruder,
you should get bit by a pit bull.</font>

24
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

25
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the biggest... Uh, how long do
you think this process usually takes?</font>

26
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:53,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a dial tone now.</font>

27
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just hung up on
me, for some reason.</font>

28
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:00,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for me
in the back back.</font>

29
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, babe.</font>

30
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:07,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, who's that?</font>

31
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:10,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my new girlfriend— Roxy.</font>

32
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">That woman seems
like a prostitute.</font>

33
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because she is.</font>

34
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're dating a prostitute?</font>

35
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for long.</font>

36
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make that whore my wife.</font>

39
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:51,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

40
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they...?</font>

41
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

42
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not just do that.</font>

43
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh-ho-ho.</font>

45
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm goin' outside, 'cause
this place is shit hole!</font>

46
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you cocks lookin' at?</font>

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank...
that woman is unspeakably crass.</font>

48
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna marry that, Frank?</font>

49
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been my number-one
girl for a long while now.</font>

50
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's still
plowing other dudes.</font>

51
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, Tiger Woods has
been calling her lately.</font>

52
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no.</font>

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">That can't be the truth.</font>

54
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:25,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bullshit.</font>

55
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no way that Tiger Woods
is interested in that woman.</font>

56
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, can't you find someone
who loves you for who you are?</font>

57
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:32,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">That woman's only in
it for the money!</font>

58
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm! Let me stop you real quick.</font>

59
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone love Frank for who he is?</font>

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

61
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! He's got a ton
of good qualities.</font>

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he does!</font>

63
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:40,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, like what?</font>

64
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:41,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

65
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, the other day, we were
hanging out under the bridge; we</font>

66
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:46,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">found box of denim, and I'm,
like, "You know, these look like</font>

67
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">good jeans in here," and he's, like,
"You want to split it with me, 50-50?"</font>

68
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's a nice thing to do.</font>

69
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted you to have
half of that denim.</font>

70
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shared half the jeans.</font>

71
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie! Charlie!</font>

72
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop wearing clothes you find
washing up under bridges.</font>

73
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they're boiled, yeah.</font>

74
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:57,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

75
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:58,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we boil all our denim.</font>

76
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, good, well, they're boiled, so...
- Hey!</font>

77
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know, there is some
dirty crack whore in the alley,</font>

78
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">blowing the busboy from the
restaurant down the street.</font>

79
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:07,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly why
we need that dog.</font>

80
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get that dog!</font>

81
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, you look bad.</font>

82
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, really bad.</font>

83
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

84
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:16,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, is that your
shirt or my shirt?</font>

85
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, like, way
too small for you.</font>

86
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look fat as shit!</font>

87
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, I'm getting very
concerned with the integrity of</font>

88
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">our organization here.</font>

89
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, you have gained, I
mean, 50 pounds of fat.</font>

90
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:26,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mass.</font>

91
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fat.</font>

92
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muscle.</font>

93
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's be clear: fat.</font>

94
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fat.</font>

95
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you are talking about marrying
hookers— this is ridiculous!</font>

96
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:33,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on with our group?</font>

97
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:34,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're becoming the Gross Crew.</font>

98
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gross Crew?</font>

99
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gross Crew.</font>

100
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:37,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't like that.</font>

101
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:38,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want that, all right?</font>

102
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:39,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want that.</font>

103
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if we're gonna have this
woman hanging around, then we</font>

104
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">gotta clean her up or something.</font>

105
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you what— what if we took a
<i>Pretty Woman</i> and threw it</font>

106
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:44,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy's way.</font>

153
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,384
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What?</i></font>

154
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:09,818
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, you're already
in your second act.</i></font>

156
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,088
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah. We're all in our second
acts— don't you see that?</i></font>

157
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,790
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I, for one, I don't
want things to change.</i></font>

158

Mac, and that's gonna be me,</i></font>

172
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,379

197
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,454
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Check it out, though.</i></font>

198
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,489

meeting a millionaire.</i></font>

201
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,426
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That... defeats the purpose.</i></font>

202
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:27,096
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, I'm gonna be
the millionaire.</i></font>

203
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,063
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh. Explain.</i></font>

204
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,365
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All right, check it out.</i></font>

205
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,433
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're gonna play my
limo driver, right?</i></font>

206
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:33,469
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're just like a regular
working stiff to this girl.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She doesn't think you're
a millionaire, okay?</i></font>

date with my limo driver!"</i></font>

223
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:59,376
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just get 'em out.</i></font>

224
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get 'em out— whoo, baby!</i></font>

00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, these blood tests are

body, and my hope is that it</font>

228
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">will incentivize you to finally
lose some of this disgusting</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">weight you've put on.</font>

230
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous, dude, okay?</font>

231
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting older.</font>

232
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,016

vigilant I become.</font>

235
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I don't eat lunch
anymore, for instance.</font>

236
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and on odd days,
I don't eat breakfast.</font>

237
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:29,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds miserable.</font>

238
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, dude, it's not miserable.</font>

239
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah, it is a little bit
miserable, but it has to be, man.</font>

240
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">No pain, no gain.</font>

241
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am also constantly in motion.</font>

242
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, right now, dude, I am
doing leg lifts that are</font>

243
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">imperceptible to the human eye.</font>

244
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call them hummingbirds.</font>

245
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:46,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And although I seem relaxed, I'm
actually incredibly tense at all times.</font>

through this, okay?</font>

247
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cultivating mass.</font>

248
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop staying that.</font>

249
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:54,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not cultivating mass, and
if you are, stop cultivating</font>

250
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,329

<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, I'm not going to try...
Try and move me, bro.</font>

254
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:03,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a running start.</font>

255
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a running start.</font>

256
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

257
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:11,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you want me to read
these test results or not?</font>

258
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was just trying to...
trying to move him.</font>

259
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like a brick wall.</font>

260
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:15,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

261
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You try to move me, Doc.</font>

262
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, you're...
Read the results, Doc.</font>

263
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:21,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I see, uh, severe
dehydration here, multiple</font>

anemia, low blood pressure.</font>

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, look, I don't want
you to fret, okay?</font>

267
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to get you on
my exercise program.</font>

268
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to get you
fit as a fiddle.</font>

269
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, these are...
these are your results, Mr. Reynolds.</font>

270
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No, those can't be my...
my results.</font>

271
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm healthy as shit.</font>

272
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, not according
to your tests.</font>

273
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm healthier
than you, bro.</font>

274
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't exactly
say you're healthy.</font>

275
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have type 2
adult-onset diabetes.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Type 2 adult-onset diabetes?</font>

277
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean for me?</font>

278
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:54,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that means you're going
to have to inject yourself</font>

279
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">several times a day with
insulin, or else you probably</font>

280
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:58,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">need to think about
losing a little weight.</font>

281

<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

282
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm healthy
besides the diabetes?</font>

283
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:03,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, no.</font>

284
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm more healthier than he
is, I think is the point that</font>

285
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're trying to make.</font>

286
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even with the diabetes.</font>

287
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:09,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, stop saying "diabetes!"</font>

288
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:15,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like an ass...
You okay, dude?</font>

289
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.</font>

290
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just, uh...
been doing a lot of hummingbirds today.</font>

293
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

294
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,617

299
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:32,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not as strong as
I thought, Dennis.</font>

300
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I've hurt my back.</font>

301
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:40,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm shit-faced.</font>

302
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, you downed that bottle
of schnapps like it was a soda pop.</font>

303
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:46,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Roxy, I'm trying to give
you a second chance here, but</font>

304
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,405

00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, this jacket is awesome.</font>

306
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, and it's tighter
than dick skin, man.</font>

307
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:54,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you watch your
language, please, Roxy?</font>

308
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:57,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in a classy place with classy
clothes for classy people, okay?</font>

309
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk about dick skin.</font>

310
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

311
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:00,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you with something?</font>

312
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:06,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are aware
that jacket is $500.</font>

316
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you implying we
can't afford that?</font>

317
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:09,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you?</font>

318
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's none of your business.</font>

319
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, it's exactly my business.</font>

320
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

321
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw your dick skin jacket, man.</font>

322
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,168

00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, no, don't do that.</font>

325
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you like me now, gay boy?</font>

326
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now, okay, okay.</font>

327
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:23,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call him gay, 'cause it'd
be one thing if he wasn't, but</font>

328
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">he clearly is, so...
Is there a problem?</font>

329
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a problem, man.</font>

330
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:30,448

this asshole here is giving me shit.</font>

00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:31,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are aware of the price.</font>

332
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here.</font>

333
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I have money.</font>

334
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:36,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

335
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry, can I talk with you
in my office, please?</font>

336
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have got to be kidding me.</font>

337
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, face, Jerry, face!</font>

338
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a hike!</font>

339
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about the gay stuff.</font>

340
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">That did cross the line.</font>

341
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry, please, my office.</font>

342
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:51,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy!</font>

343
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:52,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.</font>

344
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was amazing.</font>

345
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You humiliated that salesman, and then
you had the capital to back it up.</font>

346
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, Roxy.</font>

347
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I got to meet a client.</font>

348
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, Roxy, you don't
have to do that anymore.</font>

349
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:04,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

350
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go find Frank, 'cause
he's got a surprise for you.</font>

351
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's Tiger Woods.</font>

352
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Tiger Woods?</font>

353
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:10,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

354
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, th-this whole thing
is blowing my mind.</font>

355
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your life is way more glamorous

00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

360
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's more like what
I was picturing.</font>

361
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, I feel like a sack
of shit in this thing.</font>

362
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look good.</font>

363
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I'm a... I'm a four year
old going to my sister's wedding.</font>

365
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:34,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to look the part, bud.</font>

366
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't look like
a millionaire.</font>

367
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a casual
millionaire from Texas.</font>

368
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a farmer.</font>

369
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I got the whole
thing worked out.</font>

370
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, listen to me.</font>

371
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:43,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got out on the date.</font>

372
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come down with a slight cough.</font>

373
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:46,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

374
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask to be taken home.</font>

375
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take over.</font>

376
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You charm the hell out of her.</font>

00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how long it's been
since I've been with a non-pro?</font>

379
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you relax?</font>

380
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello.</font>

443
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, help me!</font>

444
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, shit, Charlie, what the
hell went on back there?</font>

445
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swallowed, like, a million
blood caplets 'cause I was gonna</font>

446
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:28,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">cough, like, you know, a handful
of blood to make it it real.</font>

447
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not I'm thinking, like,
you're not supposed to eat them</font>

448
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">or something 'cause they're
making me really sick.</font>

449
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, Charlie, you blew it.</font>

450
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one talking about
eggs and crabs and shit.</font>

451
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love eggs, Charlie.</font>

452
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:38,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like eggs.</font>

453
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I love crabs.</font>

454
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like crabs.</font>

455
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I love boiling denim
and banging whores!</font>

456
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:46,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love boiling... Well...
And I don't care if anybody</font>

457
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't like that about me.</font>

458
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't have to stick around!</font>

459
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw 'em!</font>

460
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:50,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

461
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with that chick?</font>

462
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:54,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss Roxy.</font>

463
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

464
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy and and I are
made for each other.</font>

465
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:03,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Tell you what, if
it's Roxy you want...</font>

466
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the last of it, I think.</font>

467
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:16,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiger Woods?</font>

468
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot believe you invited
him over here, Roxy.</font>

469
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:19,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">My place is a mess.</font>

470
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's here. Are you ready?</font>

471
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready. I'm very excited.</font>

472
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

473
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:28,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

474
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiger Woods.</font>

475
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Tiger.</font>

476
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:32,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, girl.</font>

477
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:34,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought a friend?</font>

478
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

479
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:36,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. I like that.</font>

480
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:36,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

481
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you ready to do this?</font>

482
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:40,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who you are.</font>

483
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you do, honey.</font>

484
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very famous.</font>

485
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, hold on a second.</font>

486
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy, this is not Tiger Woods.</font>

487
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

488
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:48,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy's an actor.</font>

489
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">He definitely pretended to be
Donovan McNabb one time when I</font>

490
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">tried out for the Eagles.</font>

491
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Donovan McNabb? Eagles?</font>

492
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:55,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
she's talking about.</font>

493
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:55,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I play golf.</font>

494
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Roxy, see, this is exactly why
you gotta stop doing this shit.</font>

495
00:15:58,774 --> 00:15:59,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, sir, seriously?</font>

496
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right, all
right, I'm sorry.</font>

497
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got me, all right?</font>

498
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm busted. I <i>am</i> an actor.</font>

499
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Don Cheadle.</font>

500
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not Don...
What are you doing?</font>

501
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:08,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

502
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:11,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care who he is if he pays
me 500 bucks to rub my feet.</font>

503
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you say 500 bucks?</font>

504
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:13,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

505
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:14,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">To rub your feet?</font>

506
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:14,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

507
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have sex with him?</font>

508
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm-mmm.</font>

509
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm into foot shit.</font>

510
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:21,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting...
What shoe size are you, by the way?</font>

511
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, your feet are bizarrely huge.</font>

512
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man will go crazy for that.</font>

513
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:29,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care for how you describe
them, but what are we talking here?</font>

514
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of money are we talking?</font>

515
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:34,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know maybe we could pop those
boots off and kick it around a bit.</font>

516
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:36,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it never hurts
to talk, does it?</font>

517
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do it.</font>

518
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's cute.</font>

519
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

520
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chimichanga, chimichanga, chimichanga,
chimichanga, chimichanga.</font>

521
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac, chimichangas are delicious.</font>

522
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, dude.</font>

523
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:46,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">So good, oh!</font>

524
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you.</font>

525
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you not want to eat one of
these every single day of your life?</font>

526
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:50,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

527
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:53,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, they're delicious,
they're full of carbs, which is</font>

528
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">great for a pump.</font>

529
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're cheap as shit.</font>

530
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hence the garbage bags
filled with them.</font>

531
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. No restrictions.</font>

532
00:16:58,502 --> 00:16:59,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">No restrictions.</font>

533
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love this no
restrictions thing, man.</font>

534
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:03,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now in that vein, I want you to
take a look at that chimichanga.</font>

535
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to say to yourself,
"Chimichanga, you are</font>

536
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">delicious, but what
do I really want?"</font>

537
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I really want?</font>

538
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want more than
anything else in the entire world?</font>

539
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I want more than anything
else in this entire world?</font>

540
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:15,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

541
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crack.</font>

542
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:22,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I thought you were gonna say
pizza or buffalo wings or something.</font>

543
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, no, no.</font>

544
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want crack?</font>

545
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:25,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, crack cocaine.</font>

546
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I've never had crack.</font>

547
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you are going to love it.</font>

548
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am?</font>

549
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so good.</font>

550
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it!</font>

551
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">No restrictions, baby,
no restrictions.</font>

552
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">No restrictions.</font>

553
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man, this is gonna
be awesome, dude.</font>

554
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:36,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want some insulin?</font>

555
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:37,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

556
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo.</font>

557
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

558
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did what now?</font>

559
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she is?</font>

560
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it, but
I don't need to.</font>

561
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll see you there.</font>

562
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:48,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, bye.</font>

563
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:52,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, dude, so, apparently,
Charlie just puked blood all</font>

564
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">over some lady in a limousine and Dee is
sucking off Don Cheadle or something?</font>

565
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:58,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Frank wants to go ahead and get
married to Roxy as soon as possible.</font>

566
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we got to fire down there.</font>

567
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, we can get crack from Roxy.</font>

568
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get crack from
Roxy, Okay, perfect.</font>

569
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now do you want some
of this insulin?</font>

570
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I just want crack.</font>

571
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll get down there.</font>

572
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:11,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on the way, let's fire down
to John Wanamaker's and get</font>

573
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:14,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">ourselves a couple of
Tommy Bahama shirts.</font>

574
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you familiar?</font>

575
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, see what you mean
about these shirts, bro.</font>

576
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
You'll grow into yours, buddy.</font>

577
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, comfy as shit.</font>

578
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:23,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">They hide your fatness.</font>

579
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, they're ugly as all
hell, but I have a feeling</font>

580
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna like 'em a lot more
when I'm high as shit on crack.</font>

581
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, basticks?</font>

582
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Basticks? Is that how you're
gonna talk from now on?</font>

583
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm not taking no shit
no more, so get used to it.</font>

584
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I'm gonna
become a foot girl.</font>

585
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, gross. Whatever.</font>

586
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you ready?</font>

587
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:41,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

588
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:42,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready.</font>

589
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:44,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Roxy, Frank would
like to say a few words.</font>

590
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody.</font>

591
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gather round.</font>

592
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy... Frank.</font>

593
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:52,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are good shit, and I
want to make this legit.</font>

594
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:57,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still gonna pay you, but I want
you to stop banging other guys.</font>

595
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say?</font>

596
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to be my wife or what?</font>

597
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:06,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.</font>

598
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh-oh, my God.</font>

599
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:12,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my... Uh... ooh... Whoops.</font>

600
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ!</font>

601
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:13,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's okay.</font>

602
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:14,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">She does this from time to time.</font>

603
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's had an excessive
amount to drink, so yeah.</font>

604
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, Roxy, get up.</font>

605
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy... Come on, Roxy.</font>

606
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:21,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy?</font>

607
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big day for Frank here.</font>

608
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy, we don't have
a ton of time, Rox.</font>

609
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:25,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up!</font>

610
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bitch is dead!</font>

611
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:29,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could she be dead?</font>

612
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you her heart popped.</font>

613
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:34,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">She <i>was</i> smoking crack in the
car the whole way here and also</font>

614
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:35,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">all day long.</font>

615
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got no pulse.</font>

616
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:37,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

617
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:38,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

618
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:38,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call 911!</font>

619
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call an ambulance.</font>

620
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:41,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

621
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. No, no, no!</font>

622
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I'm sorry.</font>

623
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, what?</font>

624
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:45,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</font>

625
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we gotta think
this through, okay?</font>

626
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead hooker in my apartment?</font>

627
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:49,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't look good for me.</font>

628
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm covered in blood.</font>

629
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, not good to have
a dead hooker, right?</font>

630
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would kind of mess up our
second acts a little bit.</font>

631
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll tell you guys something.</font>

632
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smoked a little crack in
the car on the way over.</font>

633
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you bitch!</font>

634
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:00,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, does she still have any?</font>

635
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:00,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

636
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">> We can't leave her here.</font>

637
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, we can't leave her here.</font>

638
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, let's, uh... Oh, God.</font>

639
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:10,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, I mean... I don't want to
sound insensitive, but we could just</font>

640
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">put her out in the hall.</font>

641
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call in an anonymous tip.</font>

642
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're still calling 911...
Someone finds her.</font>

643
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">just from a pay phone.</font>

644
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">This seems like the best thing to
do considering the circumstances.</font>

645
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, what do you think?</font>

646
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Roxy would have
wanted it that way.</font>

647
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:25,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there you go.</font>

648
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:26,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank would know.</font>

649
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:27,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's it!</font>

650
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would know, Frank.</font>

651
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I say a few words?</font>

652
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it nice.</font>

653
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make the whole thing nice.</font>

654
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:35,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? I just want to
get her out of here.</font>

655
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:40,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice.</font>

656
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roxy, God bless you.</font>

657
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:43,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a good whore.</font>

658
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You serviced me like no
other whore ever did.</font>

659
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:50,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only my crank, but my heart.</font>

660
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:54,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm gonna miss ya.</font>

661
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:58,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

662
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">So should we get the dead
whore out of the apartment?</font>

663
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah,</font>
