back then we were pretty scared.</font>

94

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but why were we so scared?</font>

95
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:35,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Dee got us all worked up
about the computers taking</font>

had us build this bunker.</font>

105
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:55,624

out the bunker.</font>

00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell happened
to the bunker?</font>

109
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">We, uh, we raided the
bunker directly after Y2K.</font>

110
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now it's empty, now there's
nothing in here for us to use.</font>

111
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why is there a condom
wrapper on the floor?</font>

112
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you've probably been
banging in the bunker, right?</font>

113
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilty.</font>

114
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,472

him bang in here.</font>

00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:15,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you?</font>

116
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:15,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird, weird.</font>

117
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bunker is for emergencies.</font>

118
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:18,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a joke.</font>

119
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,909

120
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's an
emergency, I guess.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, he was probably down
here with Mac, watching you</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">rape girls and
eating pickled eggs.</font>

pickled eggs down here, though.</font>

we've never been to the All</font>

143
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, I know, but first we
need to board up windows, so,</font>

144
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you help me with this
plywood and you guys can each</font>

145
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:10,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">grab a box over there and then we'll...
And they have left, they have left now.</font>

00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a pickled egg?</font>

148
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's an egg I
brought from home.</font>

149
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention, all All American
Home Center shoppers...</font>

150
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">People seem pretty amped up.</font>

151
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get our supplies
before they sell out.</font>

152
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, for sure, you know, we
should come up with a plan and</font>

153
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">we should divide up.</font>

154
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

155
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they're spectacular.</font>

156
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine that image in 3-D.</font>

157
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, baby.</font>

158
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, my God.</font>

159
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I'm telling you, we should
get one of these 3-D TVs.</font>

160
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, totally, but
not now, okay?</font>

161
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't spend our
money on a 3-D TV.</font>

162
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right, all right, we got
to get the supplies, head up</font>

163
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:49,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the Poconos ASAP:</font>

164
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:50,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

165
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, I mean,
let's think about this.</font>

166
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, for all we know, it
could be the end of days.</font>

167
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not the end of days.</font>

168
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to go uphill.</font>

169
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, it's not the end of days.</font>

170
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down, it's
just a storm, okay?</font>

171
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">We-We'll get some batteries,
we'll get some supplies.</font>

172
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Food, we'll get food.</font>

173
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:05,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we'll get food.</font>

174
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but I feel like you
did— you didn't say food.</font>

175
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:08,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we'll get food, okay?</font>

176
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:08,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

177
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:09,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

178
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, I'm,
I'm getting crazy.</font>

179
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:12,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll get the food.</font>

180
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:13,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah— oh, my God.</font>

181
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys get the supplies.</font>

182
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll get the supplies.</font>

183
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

184
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:19,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, give us the cash because...
No, no, it's— I have Frank's credit card.</font>

185
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take the cash.</font>

186
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got the cash, we got
the credit card, let's go.</font>

187
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know what
I was thinking?</font>

188
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">In addition to supplies, might
be nice to grab some girls, you</font>

189
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">know, get them back to the bar.</font>

190
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Jackie Denardo chick— she's,
uh, sparked another storm</font>

191
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">inside me if you
know what I mean.</font>

192
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:33,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

193
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be nice to ride the
storm out with some chicks.</font>

194
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, and we could use 'em to
repopulate the planet or something.</font>

195
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll be great to have them.</font>

196
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to entertain
this notion anymore.</font>

197
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear it.</font>

198
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'd at least like to find
one, like, Mexican or Mayan</font>

199
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">or something for predictions.</font>

200
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but get some
batteries, though.</font>

201
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">You be the battery guy and I'll
be the, the chicks and tits guy.</font>

202
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

203
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank!</font>

204
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you want to come
help me do this or what?</font>

205
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, come over here.
I want you to see this.</font>

206
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank...
Come on, check this out.</font>

207
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:04,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">At any moment, hoards of maniacs could
come pouring through the windows.</font>

208
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't concern you?</font>

209
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Deandra.</font>

210
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please come over here and
sit down, look at this.</font>

211
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! What?</font>

212
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember years ago there
was a storm in New Orleans?</font>

213
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:13,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurricane Katrina?</font>

214
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Yeah, I remember it. Mm-hmm.</font>

215
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:16,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, check this out.</font>

216
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think those people
are doing, surviving or looting?</font>

217
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're surviving.</font>

218
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Okay.</font>

219
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember a man
named Rodney King?</font>

220
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course I do.</font>

221
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, the LAPD worked
him over really good.</font>

222
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

223
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:32,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. This was taken during
the Rodney King riots.</font>

224
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:36,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think these people
are doing, looting or surviving?</font>

225
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're looting.</font>

226
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, of course.</font>

227
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's the media, see?</font>

228
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it's white people, it's
survival, and when it's black</font>

229
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">people, it's looting.</font>

230
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Frank, it's because the white
people are stealing bread,</font>

231
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the black people
are stealing speakers.</font>

232
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the white people were
stealing stereo equipment, I</font>

233
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:52,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">would say they
were looting, too.</font>

234
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:55,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know the blacks don't
have bread in those speakers?</font>

235
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

236
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we talking
about right now?</font>

237
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:58,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are big things to do.</font>

238
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:00,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, all right, listen,
listen, listen, okay, calm down.</font>

239
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the best part.</font>

240
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:02,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">More?</font>

241
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, just check this out.</font>

242
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was taken
during the riots.</font>

243
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you recognize
anybody in there?</font>

244
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing in the video?</font>

245
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I happened to be out in L.A.
during the riots.</font>

246
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:11,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on business.</font>

247
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to steal ski
equipment, I guess.</font>

248
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I went in for a loaf
of bread, I took some skis.</font>

249
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody's happy.</font>

250
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the people who own the skis.</font>

251
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:19,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

252
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:22,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, calm...
Oh, my God, the power went out!</font>

253
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

254
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is terrible!</font>

255
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:24,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to get at...</font>

256
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:25,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus! Goddamn it.</font>

257
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I like to have
this little baby with me.</font>

258
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:30,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. I'm go...
All right, let's go to the bunker... bunker.</font>

259
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:31,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You come with me.</font>

260
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, go first. Don't.</font>

261
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just be careful with that.</font>

262
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna call it
a hurricane party.</font>

263
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be cool.</font>

264
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be awesome, yeah.</font>

265
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:38,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a hurricane party?</font>

266
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:39,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hurricane party's exactly
what it sounds like.</font>

267
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a party during a hurricane
at our bar, Paddy's Pub.</font>

268
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:42,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I've heard of that bar.</font>

269
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

270
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hello!</font>

271
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right! Hi.</font>

272
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy, crazy weather
coming our way.</font>

273
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:50,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

274
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trying to get these girls
down to the bunker, or...?</font>

275
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:55,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I'm inviting them back
to our very cool bar we own.</font>

276
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool, cool.</font>

277
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

278
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we got a
sweet bunker, too.</font>

279
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well... It's, like, so secure,
people can't get in or out if we don't</font>

280
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:03,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">want 'em to.</font>

281
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be, like, totally
safe down there.</font>

282
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

283
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a bunch of supplies.</font>

284
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys like pickled eggs?</font>

285
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sardines, too... Yeah, we got a bunch
of other, you know, normal food and</font>

286
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">normal stuff there, too.</font>

287
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:11,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

288
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:12,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's a great bar.</font>

289
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna be free drinks for
everybody, so you know, you'll</font>

290
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">come, you'll party with us, and you can
bring your girlfriends, too, you know?</font>

291
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

292
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:20,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want
just the two of you.</font>

293
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to bring

296
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:26,083

320
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,297

334
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet me in the office section.</font>

335
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. All right, good.</font>

336
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find Mac, 'cause we got
to get out of here, man.</font>

337
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, no, no.</font>

338
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, let's loose the hatchet.</font>

339
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:43,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man. The...
I got another hatchet.</font>

340
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you worry about that.</font>

341
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark as shit in here.</font>

342
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very creepy.</font>

343
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get to the bunker.</font>

344
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that? Was that a rat?</font>

345
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:57,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a looter.
Loot... Behind us.</font>

346
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:00,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a looter! Looter! Shoot him!</font>

347
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:02,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't shoot! It's Cricket!</font>

348
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, no!</font>

349
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cricket.</font>

350
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what are you doing
down here, Cricket?</font>

351
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come down the
bunker sometimes when it rains.</font>

352
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we got to get him
to the hospital.</font>

353
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I ain't going
to no hospital.</font>

354
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">They euthanize the homeless.</font>

355
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're goddamned death mps!</font>

356
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:20,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got no hand, Cricket.</font>

357
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:21,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a hand, Frank.</font>

358
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's-It's a little...
I have a hole in it. Big deal.</font>

359
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Frank, I'm gonna
be honest with you.</font>

360
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:27,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really want to go to the
hospital, either, you know,</font>

361
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're gonna be there
when the hurricane hits, and</font>

362
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's gonna be packed to
the gills with vagrants.</font>

363
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:31,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your mind?</font>

364
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man is bleeding
to death here.</font>

365
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay, oh, you
know what we could do?</font>

366
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could dress him up and take
him upstairs, and then the</font>

367
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">looters would think he's the
owner of the bar, and they'd</font>

368
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">have their way with him, and if
he died, you know, it's on them,</font>

369
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:41,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">and-and not on us.</font>

370
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:42,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">That-That's good.</font>

371
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just do that.</font>

372
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't listen to him!</font>

373
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's delirious!</font>

374
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're bleeding out, Cricket!</font>

375
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:48,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing...
Frank, this is nothing.</font>

376
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:49,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

377
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Cricket, all right, fine,
we'll go, we'll go to the hospital.</font>

378
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, we are coming right back
here after we drop him off, to</font>

379
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">be where we are safe in the
bunker where we belong, okay?</font>

380
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

381
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, get out.</font>

382
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're marching me to the ovens.</font>

383
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis!</font>

384
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:05,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are, dude.</font>

385
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:07,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, things are getting
kind of bad in here, man.</font>

386
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, people are all
worked up, right?</font>

387
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:10,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm been trying to find Mac.</font>

388
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not answering
my phone calls.</font>

389
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went out to the parking lot to
see if he was out there hiding</font>

390
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:15,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">out in the car or something.</font>

391
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took off! Car's gone!</font>

392
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, well, clearly, he's
evacuated to the Poconos.</font>

393
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:19,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
he'd do that to us?</font>

394
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely do that to us.</font>

395
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

396
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:22,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bad, dude.</font>

397
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:23,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you got here?</font>

398
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:24,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you working on?</font>

399
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:25,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, this is great.</font>

400
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an agreement
for the women.</font>

401
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:28,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

402
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it guarantees that
whoever comes back to the bar</font>

the rules that we set forth.</font>

405
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:33,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk me through the details.</font>

406
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:34,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you got, Dennis?</font>

407
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, it's all very simple,
Charlie, very simple stuff.</font>

with our daughters' daughters'</font>

443
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:57,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a perfect society.</font>

444
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I see where you're going
with that, but it sounds</font>

445
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">like it could get
a little messy.</font>

446
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could get a little stick...
let's work out a new agreement, you know...</font>

447
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we'll come up
with a separate agreement.</font>

448
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who sleeps with whose daughter?</font>

449
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:07,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that sounds good.</font>

450
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, all right, I'm gonna go
talk to this woman, you know?</font>

451
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, okay, okay.</font>

452
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

453
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... I got to say, man, this
woman's, like, really throwing</font>

454
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">me off, dude, I feel
very, very nervous.</font>

455
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:16,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't usually get nervous.</font>

456
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:17,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to help you out?</font>

457
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:18,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... no.</font>

458
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go over there with you.</font>

459
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I want you to stay
as far away from me as possible.</font>

460
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're standing too close
to me as it is, actually.</font>

461
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you gotten
into the cheese?</font>

462
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a whole cheese section.</font>

463
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:27,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet there is.</font>

464
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:27,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went nuts.</font>

465
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, you stink.</font>

466
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm, all right,
you know what?</font>

467
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find Frank,
he'll pick us up.</font>

468
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, go call Frank.</font>

469
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go talk to the, uh...
I don't think I can do it</font>

470
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">dressed like this, though.</font>

471
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look ridiculous.</font>

472
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, I don't mean to be a bother,
but are we almost at the hospital?</font>

473
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the hell up, Cricket!</font>

474
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm driving
as fast as I can!</font>

475
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:49,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you not see that?</font>

476
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

477
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, Frank?</font>

478
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:54,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, Frank?</font>

479
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting air.</font>

480
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sucking it all
up with your panicking.</font>

481
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:57,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's freezing outside.</font>

482
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna catch cold and then everyone's
going to get sick in the bunker.</font>

483
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking
about, freezing?</font>

484
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's sunny as shit.</font>

485
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you calm down,
for crying out loud?</font>

486
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:07,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna give
me a heart attack.</font>

487
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:09,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all right.</font>

488
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

489
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:11,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Charlie.</font>

00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:14,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo.</font>

00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:28,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, n-n-n-no, I'm not getting stranded
in the bunker with no supplies.</font>

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, what about me?</font>

Cricket, goddamn you, it's not about you!</font>

00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm gonna pick up the guys,
then I'll drop you off at the hospital.</font>

501
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna take two
seconds, okay?</font>

502
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that okay, Cricket,
with you, huh?</font>

503
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:44,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

get out of the way.</font>

I will slice you in half.</font>

you we're dependant on machines.</font>
