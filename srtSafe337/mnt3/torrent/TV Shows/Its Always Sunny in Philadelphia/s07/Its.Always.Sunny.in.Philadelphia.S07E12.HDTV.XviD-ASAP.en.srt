<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be a good night for us.</font>

91
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, remember how she was
the coolest girl in school?</font>

92
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:05,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

93
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

94
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she was definitely the
prettiest girl in school.</font>

95
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was not. She was not, no.</font>

96
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the most forgettable
girl in school.</font>

97
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, which, by the way, is the worst
thing you could be in high school.</font>

98
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally insignificant.</font>

99
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, good feelings
are gonna get sparked up.</font>

100
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:18,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna see her, she's gonna see me.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, you guys, you guys.</font>

102
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:20,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

103
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brad Fisher. Brad Fisher.</font>

104
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not gonna be happy to see
me after that present I gave him.</font>

105
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what present?</font>

106
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the box of hornets.</font>

107
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, that acne really
came back, didn't it?</font>

108
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it sure did.</font>

109
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:30,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy looks like shit.</font>

110
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

111
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I tell you what.</font>

112
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:34,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you guys sneak past him, and
Mac and I will pick up the name tags.</font>

113
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:35,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

114
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does that sound?</font>

115
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

116
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:37,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

117
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:37,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll meet you inside.</font>

118
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:38,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

119
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, go, go, go.</font>

120
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, come on.</font>

121
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, it's
Brad Fisher, all right!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, buddy?</font>

123
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not great.</font>

124
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:49,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, well, the acne definitely
came back in full force.</font>

125
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

126
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a shame, but I have products
that will clear that acne up, man.</font>

127
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not acne, actually.</font>

128
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:56,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's hornet scars.</font>

129
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh! Ouch. Yikes.</font>

130
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I have any products that'll,
that'll take care of hornet scars.</font>

131
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's more of a...
Plastic surgery situation.</font>

132
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:08,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, plastic surgery
would do it, though.</font>

133
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

134
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">But lasers... Lasers would do it.</font>

135
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd blast those monsters...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

136
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys seen Charlie around?</font>

137
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie Kelly?</font>

138
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:14,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

139
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

140
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:18,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we don't, we don't
associate with him anymore.</font>

141
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm gonna take off.</font>

142
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

143
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Messy.</font>

144
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh-hoo-hoo.</font>

145
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's stay out of that.</font>

146
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:23,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let's stay out of that.</font>

147
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just grab our name tags, huh?</font>

148
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:26,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see 'em over here.</font>

149
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here we go.</font>

150
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we got Charlie, we got
Dee, I got myself right there.</font>

151
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

152
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:34,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, I'm not seeing yours.</font>

153
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I grabbed mine already.</font>

154
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:35,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in my pocket.</font>

155
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, did you grab it?</font>

156
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

157
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, well, pop it on.</font>

158
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'm probably not gonna wear mine.</font>

159
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, who wears a name tag, right?
That's not cool.</font>

160
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna wear mine.</font>

161
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:46,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm seeing everybody else wearing their
name tags, so just pop that on, buddy.</font>

162
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody calls me this anymore.</font>

163
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:50,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I feel like it's
gonna confuse people.</font>

164
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not, because everybody
called you that in high school,</font>

165
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">so pop it on because it's
definitely a rule and they're</font>

166
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">not gonna let you inside without it.</font>

167
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:57,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been so long.</font>

168
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably not even
my name legally anymore.</font>

169
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:01,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to pop it on.</font>

170
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

171
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:17,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Well, okay, Ronald McDonald.</font>

172
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me that.</font>

173
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's your name.</font>

174
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Ronald, I'm gonna take a
little lap around, get people</font>

175
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:25,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">abuzz about my presence at the reunion.</font>

176
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:28,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll meet up with
you guys later, okay?</font>

177
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:36,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one, no one calls me... ♪</font>

178
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he looking?</font>

179
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:43,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who? That guy?</font>

180
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, is he looking at my back rig now?</font>

181
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see the waitress anywhere?</font>

182
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Shut up.</font>

183
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not looking at your back, Dee.</font>

184
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

185
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so obsessed with this guy?</font>

186
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Adriano Calvaniste, Charlie.</font>

187
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the guy who coined the
name "Aluminum monster."</font>

188
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? That's him?</font>

189
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

190
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:56,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cool.</font>

191
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to meet him.</font>

192
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have met him, Charlie.</font>

193
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called you Dirtgrub and
he made you eat spiders.</font>

194
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:01,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that guy!</font>

195
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

196
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he was, like, so cool.</font>

197
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was, like, way above me.</font>

198
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, him and his cronies
all thought that they were</font>

199
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:11,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">way above you and everybody else,
but I've got a plan to get revenge.</font>

200
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna sew myself
into their inner circle.</font>

201
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. How you gonna do that?</font>

202
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm gonna lure 'em in
with my good looks, and then</font>

203
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">as far as I remember, all you
really got to do to get in with</font>

204
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">that crowd is be really
cruel to people.</font>

205
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

206
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:23,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm gonna gain their trust and when
the moment's right, I'm gonna strike.</font>

207
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool, all right.</font>

208
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing it for us, Charlie.</font>

209
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah.</font>

210
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm. Is it, is it him?</font>

211
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:28,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's coming over.</font>

212
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, do you see a spider I can eat?
I can eat a spider.</font>

213
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, stop. Charlie, keep your
mouth shut, keep your...</font>

214
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:38,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, um, excuse me, but
aren't you the aluminum monster?</font>

215
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I mean, no.</font>

216
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't call me
that anymore, but yeah.</font>

217
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor should they.</font>

218
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:45,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, wow, you've, uh,
you've really transformed.</font>

219
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look great.</font>

220
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:47,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

221
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:48,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

222
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:49,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

223
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dirtgrub.</font>

224
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:53,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

225
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so cool.</font>

226
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so cool, Adriano.</font>

227
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

228
00:06:56,298 --> 00:07:00,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, um, why don't you smell this?</font>

229
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's probably poisonous, right?</font>

230
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably, but, you
know, smell it anyway.</font>

231
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should-should I smell it?</font>

232
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smell it.</font>

233
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

234
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie!</font>

235
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, dude?</font>

236
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he wanted me to smell a pen,
and I was going to smell</font>

237
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">the pen, because it's Adriano...
You don't have to do that anymore.</font>

238
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ronald McDonald, right?</font>

239
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:19,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

240
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:21,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your information,
nobody calls me that.</font>

241
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right.</font>

242
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:23,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did we call you?</font>

243
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronnie the Rat.</font>

244
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronnie the Rat, yeah, I
remember, yeah, yeah.</font>

245
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did we call him that anyway?</font>

246
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause he was a nark and a
tattletale, and he became the</font>

247
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">main drug dealer when he told
on the other main drug dealer.</font>

248
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, yeah, yeah, I remember.</font>

249
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, looks like the rat got a
little too much cheese, huh?</font>

250
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fat.</font>

251
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not funny.</font>

252
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put on mass.</font>

253
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:39,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">We eat a lot of cheese.</font>

254
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:40,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">We eat a lot of cheese.</font>

255
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">To put on mass.</font>

256
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you also give
everybody ringworm?</font>

257
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:43,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

258
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:44,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a rumor.</font>

259
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only gave ringworm to Charlie.</font>

260
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it from my dog Poppins,
and then Charlie and I were</font>

261
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">wrestling every day because
we were trying out for the</font>

262
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">wrestling team, and then, you know, we
just sort of passed it back and forth.</font>

263
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:56,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">We passed it back and forth...
Although then we did try out</font>

264
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the wrestling team, and then
I do think a couple of the guys</font>

265
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">got it on the team, so yeah,
you're right, you're right.</font>

266
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:03,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, yeah, yeah, no, that is really gross.
I mean, that is...</font>

267
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's about as low as it gets.</font>

268
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">They probably still have it,
'cause they're so gay together.</font>

269
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:08,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

270
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dee, why don't you come back to
our table— you know, have a drink?</font>

271
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, okay.</font>

272
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

273
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds cool.</font>

274
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later, Dirtgrub
and Ronnie the Rat.</font>

275
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope you suck each other's rotten
peckers until you get mouth cancer.</font>

276
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mouth cancer.</font>

277
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I come to the table?</font>

278
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

279
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some reason, homophobia, it's
just, it's awesome to these</font>

280
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">guys. I'm sewing myself in.</font>

281
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:27,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing this for us, okay?</font>

282
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is she talking about?</font>

283
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to strike
when the moment's right.</font>

284
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's doing it for us, dude.</font>

285
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

286
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:33,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

287
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:34,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you thank her?</font>

288
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I thanked her, absolutely.</font>

289
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:37,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what's up, boys?</font>

290
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

291
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I got your name tags.</font>

292
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

293
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, did you get on Mac about his?</font>

294
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's got... It's not that...
It's not funny.</font>

295
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so funny.</font>

296
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adriano came over,
blasted him about it.</font>

297
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:48,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh he did?</font>

298
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good, oh good.</font>

299
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Adriano's probably going
to tell everybody about it.</font>

300
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's going to get
around the whole reunion.</font>

301
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll get going round
and round and round.</font>

302
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably not.</font>

303
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably getting old already.</font>

304
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">So listen, guys, this is where
we part ways, all right?</font>

305
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:00,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do do not talk to me for the
rest of the night, and know that</font>

306
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be talking to you,
because you lower my stock.</font>

307
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:02,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys get it.</font>

308
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:05,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go post up one of
these tables around here, let my</font>

309
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">loyal subjects come and kiss my ring.</font>

310
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:11,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, don't laugh when
people make fun of me.</font>

311
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Stash.</font>

312
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stash.</font>

313
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, brother?</font>

314
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:24,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis.</font>

315
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, man.</font>

316
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's catch up a little bit.</font>

317
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:30,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right, I'll
catch you later, man.</font>

318
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:32,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, if you see any of the old crew,
let them know I'm posted up over here.</font>

319
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think they know I'm— I'm here.</font>

320
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis.</font>

321
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you...?</font>

322
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I snuck right by that security prick.</font>

323
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I got myself a name tag.</font>

324
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Nicki Potnick.</font>

325
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember the time he crashed
my car into the tree?</font>

326
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went crazy and the tire went down...
We had such a good time.</font>

327
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Frank, first off, Nicki
Potnick is a girl, okay?</font>

328
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">And secondly, she's not 65 years old.</font>

329
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to talk to you.</font>

330
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be around you.</font>

331
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go find Mac and Charlie.</font>

332
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:54,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go.</font>

333
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why— why are you sitting
at a table with no people?</font>

334
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were cool.</font>

335
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am cool.</font>

336
00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the coolest kid here.</font>

337
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:02,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just, you know, posting up,
and they're going to come to me.</font>

338
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:02,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what's going on.</font>

339
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Dennis.</font>

340
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

341
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, goddamn.</font>

342
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:07,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're late on your alimony.</font>

343
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:09,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we not talk about
alimony payments right now?</font>

344
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:10,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at our reunion.</font>

345
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:12,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't think you'd run
into your ex-wife, huh?</font>

346
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I didn't think about it, Maureen,
because I don't think about you.</font>

347
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:15,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

348
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

349
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think about this?</font>

350
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:21,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it wafted over here.</font>

351
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:24,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dead tooth— it spurted
in my nose, it stinks.</font>

352
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:25,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that supposed to be?</font>

353
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where your monthly
payments are going.</font>

354
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a diamond tooth, Dennis.</font>

355
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dead tooth, Maureen.</font>

356
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a diamond in it.</font>

357
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put a diamond on anything
that's dead, and it's still</font>

358
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:34,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">dead, Maureen. It's rotting.</font>

359
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:35,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it out of your face.</font>

360
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't want to talk
about these things, all right?</font>

361
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:39,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to talk to old men
who are pretending to be women,</font>

362
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and-and ex-wives, all right?</font>

363
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be seen like this.</font>

364
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, bitches.</font>

365
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for...!</font>

366
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, I'm off the wagon.</font>

367
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:49,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

368
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:50,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, Dennis?</font>

369
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to go find my name tag—
they didn't have one for me.</font>

370
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

371
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:56,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, see you later.</font>

372
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:00,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I went to go find my name
tag— they didn't even have one.</font>

373
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like— it's like
what, I never existed?</font>

374
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, who cares though, right?</font>

375
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause it's high school.</font>

376
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?</font>

377
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

378
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go, grab it.</font>

379
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes!</font>

380
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:26,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shots for everybody. Shots for the cool...
Oh, Rickety Cricket, everybody.</font>

381
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.</font>

382
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rickety, rickety, rickety.</font>

383
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rickety Cricket!</font>

384
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cricks, how are you?</font>

385
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">All cleaned up huh,
except for that tooth.</font>

386
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, actually it's Father Mara again.</font>

387
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

388
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cleaned up, yes, and I was
welcomed back into the cloth.</font>

389
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:45,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">God had a plan for me.</font>

390
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took me into a deep valley, but
now I'm soaring on eagle's</font>

391
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">wings, so praise Him.</font>

392
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:50,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

393
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that, street rat.</font>

394
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

395
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:55,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I tell you what, Crick,
should I put my balls on your</font>

396
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">chin now or later, huh?</font>

397
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, huh?</font>

398
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down the hatch, everybody.</font>

399
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down the hatch, everybody...
but you, Father.</font>

400
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, nonetheless, I
say to you peace, peace be to</font>

401
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">you, Deandra, okay?</font>

402
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:06,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird.</font>

403
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">And peace be to you, my lady.</font>

404
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:12,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to you, my son, peace be to you.</font>

405
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">To you.</font>

406
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:17,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, everybody, remember me?</font>

407
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably not.</font>

408
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sat behind you in Spanish, remember?</font>

409
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sat... sat right next
to you in Algebra one.</font>

410
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell is that?</font>

411
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:25,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.</font>

412
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:27,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen her before in my life.</font>

413
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee. Dee, you know me, Dee.</font>

414
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Dee.</font>

415
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and Dee, we go way back.</font>

416
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad choice on the dress,
know what I mean?</font>

417
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you, bitch.</font>

418
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you, bitch.</font>

419
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey.</font>

420
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">More shots, more shots, more shots,
more shots, more shots, more shots.</font>

421
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the queen of the night.</font>

422
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the queen of the night,
right, cool table?</font>

423
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, I just shook your dead tooth wife.</font>

424
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I had to wash
my hands and face.</font>

425
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am trying to shake you, Frank.</font>

426
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just smells so bad.</font>

427
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please go away from me.</font>

428
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please get away.</font>

429
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Dennis.</font>

430
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

431
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Tim Murphy. Son of a bitch.</font>

432
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:17,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Tim Murphy?</font>

433
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tim Murphy is the asshole
that slept with my prom date.</font>

434
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis Reynolds, what's up, man?</font>

435
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:24,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Tim.</font>

436
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my wife Christie.</font>

437
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis and I used to be
really good friends.</font>

438
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.</font>

439
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:29,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicki Potnick.</font>

440
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

441
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, honey?</font>

442
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

443
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:34,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go dance.</font>

444
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go ahead.</font>

445
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to hang for a bit.</font>

446
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

447
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you both.</font>

448
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Va-va-voom.</font>

449
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyhow, I saw you
standing over here alone.</font>

450
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to invite you
over to our table.</font>

451
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I won't be going
anywhere with you, Tim.</font>

452
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, why?</font>

453
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:53,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you play coy with
me, you little bitch.</font>

454
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:57,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to stay right here, and I'm
going to wait for my minions to swarm me.</font>

455
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">And swarm they will, Tim.</font>

456
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alone you'll be.</font>

457
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:02,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha.</font>

458
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:07,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such sad little games we play.</font>

459
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Tim?</font>

460
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

461
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same old Dennis Reynolds.</font>

462
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look good, Nicki.</font>

463
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Tim!</font>

464
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

465
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

466
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:18,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like a nice guy.</font>

467
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not. Go!</font>

468
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away from me!</font>

469
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just got to get our mojo back.</font>

470
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:27,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

471
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some drinks in us, and...
Confidence, yeah.</font>

472
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six beers, for the two of us, please.</font>

473
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink tickets for the
two of us, please.</font>

474
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all right.</font>

475
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

476
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, this is only four.</font>

477
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all they gave us, bozo.</font>

478
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:40,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's only two per person, bozo.</font>

479
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:44,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how am I supposed to get drunk
off of only four beers? I, I...</font>

480
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any way you can work something out?
Or... Two tickets per person, guy.</font>

481
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask you, pretty boy.</font>

482
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a conversation between
me and the longhair.</font>

483
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:51,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

484
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">None for him, or the fat bitch.</font>

485
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You making this about weight?</font>

486
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gained a lot of weight.</font>

487
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to take some
shit from some bartender.</font>

488
00:14:58,967 --> 00:14:59,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a bartender.</font>

489
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know that!</font>

490
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, did you guys see
Ronald McDonald's his name?</font>

491
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

492
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight beers, my friends.</font>

493
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, buddy?</font>

494
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you? Boom!</font>

495
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:08,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy.</font>

496
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:09,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

497
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was only two per person!</font>

498
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:12,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">The, uh, computer lab printed
out like a hundred of them.</font>

499
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way more than I need.</font>

500
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:14,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome.</font>

501
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get a few of them?</font>

502
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No way.</font>

503
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:18,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, I'm sorry I brought it up, man.</font>

504
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:19,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

505
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Adriano, can I get
some more of those tickets?</font>

506
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:21,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you bet. Here.</font>

507
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:22,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help yourself.</font>

508
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

509
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:23,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch!</font>

510
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:24,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just gave them to that guy.</font>

511
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:28,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that guy's cool, so...
Okay, I got an idea, man.</font>

512
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:29,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a, I got an
excellent plan, Charlie.</font>

513
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to get everything we
need, we're going to get our</font>

514
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">confidence back, and we're going
to fire back into this room.</font>

515
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:34,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready?</font>

516
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:35,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, good.</font>

517
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:35,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

518
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:36,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want those guys to like us.</font>

519
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:37,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow my lead.</font>

520
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

521
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adriano made fake tickets.</font>

522
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:40,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those tickets are fake!</font>

523
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:41,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't rat on him!</font>

524
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he made fake ones, and he
gets to drink and we don't.</font>

525
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not fair!</font>

526
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:46,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, I'm sorry.</font>

527
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">If those are fake, you can't
get any of these beers.</font>

528
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

529
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:50,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got in trouble.</font>

530
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got in trouble!</font>

531
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Ronnie the Rat strikes again, huh?</font>

532
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks a lot, douchebag.</font>

533
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:56,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst, Dirtgrub.</font>

534
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

535
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have anything to do...
Don't sell me out.</font>

536
00:15:59,193 --> 00:15:59,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what you did, man?</font>

537
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're supposed to be on
the same team, Charlie.</font>

538
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw... see, high school sucks!</font>

539
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

540
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go to the bathroom,
I'm going to find stuff to huff,</font>

541
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:05,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to get high.</font>

542
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm the Dirtgrub, I'm going
to be the Dirtgrub.</font>

543
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to go into Plan B.</font>

544
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I brought Dee's old back
brace, and I got it in the car.</font>

545
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we can implement... Not now, Frank!</font>

546
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little rehearsal or something.</font>

547
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Charlie, dude, you
don't have to do this.</font>

548
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can find another way.</font>

549
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:25,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do!</font>

550
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just the Dirtgrub, okay?</font>

551
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone wants the Dirtgrub,
I'll give 'em the Dirtgrub.</font>

552
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get high, I'll get sad.</font>

553
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can laugh at me.</font>

554
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate high school, man.</font>

555
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, Charlie, don't put the
bleach and the ammonia together!</font>

556
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to knock
the shit out of you.</font>

557
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me how to
mix my own inhalants!</font>

558
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to do inhalants.</font>

559
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, it's going to
knock you unconscious.</font>

560
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I know how to do
my own inhalants, okay?</font>

561
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need that from... God.</font>

562
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops-a-daisy.</font>

563
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:48,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

564
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

565
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's just wait till he wakes
up, and then we'll... Oh, wow.</font>

566
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we got here?</font>

567
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronnie the Rat and, uh...
Hey, look, everyone, Nicki</font>

568
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potnick made it to the reunion.</font>

569
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

570
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you had a rough
couple of years, there, Nicki.</font>

571
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah. I'm a guy now.</font>

572
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Right. Yeah.</font>

573
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing, perving
out on Dirtgrub over there?</font>

574
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, probably.</font>

575
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what these gay guys do, they just...
knock each other</font>

576
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">out with poppers, and then find
some kinda rabies-infested</font>

577
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">rodent to tickle each
other's taints with.</font>

578
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, that's not what
we're doing, all right?</font>

579
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are grown adults.</font>

580
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are respected businessmen now.</font>

581
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did kind of rat me out there, Ronnie, so...
Yeah, so, I guess it's time</font>

582
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pay the piper, Rat.</font>

583
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh... old man I don't know.</font>

584
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! No, no!</font>

585
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:32,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are...?</font>

586
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:34,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

587
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

588
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:40,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been waiting a long time for this.</font>

589
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know me!</font>

590
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:44,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

591
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a grown, goddamn man!</font>

592
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should stay away from those people.</font>

593
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:59,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, they-they will ruin your
life like they tried to ruin mine.</font>

594
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

595
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:03,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys just missed something
so awesome that we did.</font>

596
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heed my warning.</font>

597
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how you guys doing?</font>

598
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm here.</font>

599
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe I came to this thing?</font>

600
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was posted up over there, I
guess you guys probably didn't see me.</font>

601
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:12,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we saw you.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I've sinned!</font>

625
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, you are covered in ringworm.</font>

626
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,772

627
00:18:58,774 --> 00:18:59,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me she loved me.</font>

628
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were supposed to
be together forever.</font>

00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... what are you, crazy? No!</font>

634
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I told him I loved him once,
but that was like four years ago.</font>

635
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two probably have
ringworm together, don't you?</font>

636
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

637
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,956
