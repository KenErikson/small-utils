for I have sinned.</font>

00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been one week since
my last confession.</font>

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, my son.</font>

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, what is your confession?</font>

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fat.</font>

command thee to smite my friends!</font>

8
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, calm down, son.</font>

9
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:47,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

10
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try and remain composed.</font>

11
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Father.</font>

12
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try, but I can't promise
anything 'cause I'm pretty excitable.</font>

13
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I'm super pissed because
my friends made me fat.</font>

14
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did your friends make you fat?</font>

15
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were they force-feeding you?</font>

16
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no, not exactly.</font>

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole thing started because
we became incredibly successful,</font>

18
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:09,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then they became monsters, which
in turn made them make me fat.</font>

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, really, I'd like to confess on them,
because they're sinners and pricks.</font>

20
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:18,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son, I don't think you understand
the purpose of confession.</font>

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

22
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

23
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:20,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Father.</font>

24
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:21,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need the context.</font>

25
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me start at the beginning.</font>

26
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, my friends and I own and
operate a bar in South Philly.</font>

27
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:30,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a few weeks ago, we became more
successful than we ever have before.</font>

28
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:32,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was insane.</font>

29
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, oh!</font>

30
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:35,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who's back!</font>

31
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:39,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I scored a shitload of fireworks.</font>

32
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of my way, Frank.</font>

33
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

34
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

35
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

36
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:46,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">North Carolina— what
a hell of a state.</font>

37
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:47,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, Frank.</font>

38
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're packed.</font>

39
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the shit is
going on around here?</font>

40
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really don't get it.</font>

41
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how we're so popular now.</font>

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't
wrap my head around this.</font>

43
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were we doing anything different?</font>

44
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we may have tipped.</font>

45
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:05,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

46
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:06,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is a good thing.</font>

47
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:09,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what happens with
success in business.</font>

48
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

49
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if you keep making the
right decisions over time,</font>

50
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:17,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">eventually you will get to a point where
you tip, and you become successful.</font>

51
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like that book <i>The Tipping</i> <i>Point.</i></font>

52
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,235
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I totally buy that.</i></font>

00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,237

out this decision.</i></font>

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I keep a very clean bar
every day, very tidy.</i></font>

55
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I think people respond to that.</i></font>

56
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,575
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They say, "What was that clean
bar I was at the other week?"</i></font>

57
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,476
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then they show up again.</i></font>

58
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,645
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then someone says, "Hey,
did you see that clean bar?</i></font>

59
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Let's go there."</i></font>

60
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i></font>

61
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,415
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And my comedy, you know.</i></font>

00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,951
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like, all my, all my funny jokes

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

197
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:29,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, because I drank three
bottles of champagne and hung</font>

night under a bridge, okay?</font>

jokes never land, all right?</font>

203
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">So please don't concentrate on
your comedy anymore, 'cause it's</font>

205
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I said it.</font>

what we normally do?</font>

207
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't even be
bartending, all right?</font>

218
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Company meeting.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hop on out. Company meeting.</font>

222
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to.</font>

223
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to.</font>

224
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a company meeting.</font>

225
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to... No.</font>

226
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on in there?</font>

227
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bashing it.</font>

228
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

229
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bashing it.</font>

230
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. Don't bash.</font>

231
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't bash.</font>

232
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come out. I'll come out.</font>

233
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

234
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:17,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I saw a couple gray
hairs, and I was, like, "I'll</font>

With black paint?</font>

236
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, just-just go
easy on me, all right?</font>

237
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make fun of me or anything.</font>

238
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel very sensitive right now.</font>

239
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:25,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to maintain all this.</font>

240
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like Superman.</font>

241
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:27,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool. Yeah, right on.</font>

242
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:29,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he was the
original, right, so...?</font>

243
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">The original what?</font>

244
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">S-Superhero. He was, like... Ugh.</font>

245
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you're going for?</font>

246
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

247
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, come on.</font>

248
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be that obvious,
like, if you didn't know me.</font>

249
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be, like, "Oh, shit.
Maybe that's Superman."</font>

250
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you wouldn't.</font>

251
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows who Superman is,
and they know it's not you.</font>

252
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit. Right.</font>

253
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, come on.</font>

254
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, success is starting
to get to all of us.</font>

255
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't be Superman.</font>

256
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

257
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah. No shit.</font>

258
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm running around like
an animal out there.</font>

259
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, all I'm doing
is serving drinks.</font>

260
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to serve
drinks; You're a waitress.</font>

261
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:57,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">People need their drinks, and we need
a waitress to serve those drinks.</font>

262
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, don't change now.</font>

263
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

264
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a certain chemistry
that got us here to begin with.</font>

265
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:01,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

266
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to start...
Oh, that's terrible.</font>

267
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get back out there and
step it up a little bit, please.</font>

268
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get back to work,
man, and do what we do, okay?</font>

269
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not good.</font>

270
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Back to work.</font>

271
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to work, everybody.</font>

272
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Charlie, and I'm in
charge all of a sudden."</font>

273
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you eating in there?</font>

274
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, I got some donuts and
some M&Ms and some, uh, chips.</font>

275
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could pass them through
if you want some.</font>

276
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You aren't allowed to eat in here.</font>

277
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Father.</font>

278
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I have enough.</font>

279
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want a donut, I
could give you one.</font>

280
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better put that away and
come back when you're finished.</font>

281
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

282
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I'm done... done.</font>

283
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, so Charlie was up all night
working, and Frank was still</font>

284
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming up with plans,
and they were not good.</font>

285
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

286
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

287
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's morning already, huh?</font>

288
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

289
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's good.</font>

290
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to do that to people?</font>

291
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

292
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

293
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:03,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a plan.</font>

294
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll do it to people.</font>

295
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go around... Look at that.</font>

296
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the look on your face.</font>

297
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:07,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so good.</font>

298
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I don't even think
you know what a plan is, dude.</font>

299
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I got something else
I've been working on all night.</font>

300
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come with me.</font>

301
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock up, let's go, come with me.</font>

302
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't hit me with the stick again.
Oh, my God.</font>

303
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:16,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Charlie?</font>

304
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look at this now.</font>

305
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put two extra stop signs.</font>

306
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

307
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there's four stop signs.</font>

308
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right So no cars can go.</font>

309
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you've just created
a four-way intersection.</font>

310
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, you've made
this intersection safer.</font>

311
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">No shit. Oh.</font>

312
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:40,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, dude, I don't have time
for these shenanigans, all right?</font>

313
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need sleep.</font>

314
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a success now.</font>

315
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:43,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying so hard not to tip.</font>

316
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

317
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need sleep?</font>

318
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop hitting me with the
stick, dude, I swear to God...</font>

319
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the plan, this is
the one we should have done.</font>

320
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't hit me with that anymore. Oh!</font>

321
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the one.</font>

322
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little bitch.</font>

323
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Charlie was, like, "I'm
gonna jam that stick up your ass."</font>

324
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Frank was, like, "Come here,
you little bitch, uh, God damn it."</font>

325
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't need to repeat all
of the obscene language.</font>

326
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:04,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry, Father.</font>

327
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:08,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I got lost in the moment
because I'm a natural storyteller.</font>

328
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... Anyway, I was being super
prudent, and I was mapping out</font>

329
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">my successful lifestyle— you
know, champagne, sailing.</font>

330
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:15,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted to sail.</font>

331
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was really the only one who
was handling the success with</font>

332
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">class, to be honest with you.</font>

333
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:24,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Dee interrupted me with some
lazy plan to get out of working.</font>

334
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lazy's a sin, right?</font>

335
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:26,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you mean sloth?</font>

336
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:27,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

337
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee is guilty of sloth,
and she's pro-abortion.</font>

338
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

339
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, listen to this.</font>

340
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:41,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">One sec.</font>

341
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just picking out the places I want to
avoid when I sail across the world.</font>

342
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Africa for you, huh?</font>

343
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

344
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:49,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to go to any
poor places, you know.</font>

345
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Successful guy like myself,
I'll have a target on my back.</font>

346
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

347
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I guess... Okay. Well...
That's, uh... And, uh, too cold.</font>

348
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

349
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Too violent.</font>

350
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's hot down there.</font>

351
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too angry.</font>

352
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the whole thing?</font>

353
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just going to sail around the
United States is what it looks like.</font>

354
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:10,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you're... Uh, well, I
probably want to avoid, like, this.</font>

355
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

356
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't blame you for that.</font>

357
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know
what happens out here.</font>

358
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I tell you what.</font>

359
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, while you were planning all
of this, I came up with an</font>

360
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:20,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">amazing idea that's going
to save everything for us.</font>

361
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready for this?</font>

362
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get ourselves replacements.</font>

363
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a very good idea.</font>

364
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, stay with me.</font>

365
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not just any replacements.</font>

366
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be the total embodiment
of us in looks and personality</font>

367
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that we maintain the same group
chemistry and avoid tipping.</font>

368
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:35,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they'll be like our avatars?</font>

369
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:36,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, if that helps you.</font>

370
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:37,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's tell Dennis.</font>

371
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah.</font>

372
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, Dennis, wake up.</font>

373
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sleeping.</font>

374
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

375
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you hiding under the covers?</font>

376
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

377
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God.</font>

378
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:53,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I look foolish?</font>

379
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what in God's name
have you done to your face?</font>

380
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:57,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a chemical peel.</font>

381
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a monster, dude.</font>

382
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:03,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just trying to live up to
all of your expectations of me.</font>

383
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:04,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">What expectations?</font>

384
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Physical perfection.</font>

385
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

386
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, the success of the
bar has proved that I have</font>

387
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">achieved physical perfection.</font>

388
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now there's nowhere else for
me to go but down from here.</font>

389
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now I'm hanging on by a thread.</font>

390
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you lay off the
skin treatments for a while?</font>

391
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:22,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

392
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you don't think I should
mess with my face anymore?</font>

393
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, right now it looks
like you're wearing a mask of</font>

394
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:28,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">yourself over your face.</font>

395
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

396
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a good one, not
a nice mask of myself?</font>

397
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:32,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a good one.</font>

398
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you guys think that a normal
mask of me might look good?</font>

399
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

400
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if there was,
would you guys wear it?</font>

401
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is happening?</font>

402
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very confused.</font>

403
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to be alone.</font>

404
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

405
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">And without Dennis to shit all
over Dee's ideas with me, I was</font>

406
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:57,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">lured into her very lazy,
slothy, sinful avatar plan.</font>

407
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:02,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, I got to say, I like
what I'm seeing here.</font>

408
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:03,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

409
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:07,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let me, uh... let me just
fill you in on what we're doing here.</font>

410
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, Mac and I run the hottest
bar in Philadelphia, and we are</font>

411
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking for a couple of employees
to fill our shoes, literally.</font>

412
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. That said, there's a set
of dumbbells to your feet there.</font>

413
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:18,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like you to lift those and curl
them, but don't do it in a normal way.</font>

414
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is for a
bartending job, right?</font>

415
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

416
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:23,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is all part of it.</font>

417
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:24,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, get to work beefcake.</font>

418
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Guess I can fire
off a couple reverse curls.</font>

419
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:28,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said fire off.</font>

420
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:29,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that.</font>

421
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I heard him.</font>

422
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:31,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that.</font>

423
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:32,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look... look at that.</font>

424
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:33,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

425
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

426
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:35,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">He executed those perfectly.</font>

427
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh.</font>

428
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was exactly
what I'm talking about.</font>

429
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:39,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to fast-track him, Dee.</font>

430
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:40,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's perfect.</font>

431
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:41,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? For you?</font>

432
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:42,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course.</font>

433
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:43,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do...?</font>

434
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks nothing like you.</font>

435
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no.</font>

436
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, since we've been working, I've
been neglecting my fitness regimen.</font>

437
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He understands... No, no, no, no.</font>

438
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never, ever once in your
life have looked like that.</font>

439
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I leave the gym, and I
have a full pump... Yeah?</font>

440
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee was right though.</font>

441
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me to use that gorgeous
muscle monster as my avatar, I</font>

442
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">had to put on some serious bulk.</font>

443
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did you go to the gym?</font>

444
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:08,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gym?</font>

445
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:10,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, when Peter did the
statue of David, he wasn't just</font>

446
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:11,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">hammering at pebbles.</font>

447
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:15,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, he ordered the Jews to bring
him a massive slab of marble.</font>

448
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

449
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's wrap this up.</font>

450
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

451
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so Charlie was
working his ass off.</font>

452
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, but the customers were getting
just as frustrated as he was.</font>

453
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, the pressures of success
were cracking both he and Dennis.</font>

454
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:27,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a second.</font>

455
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a second.</font>

456
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this guy.</font>

457
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:30,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my man right here.</font>

458
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who wanted the, uh, two
Coors Lights and the gin and tonic.</font>

459
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right?</font>

460
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:34,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

461
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been waiting half an
hour for a Jack and Coke.</font>

462
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been waiting half an hour?</font>

463
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been waiting half an hour?</font>

464
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, with an attitude like that, you
can wait another half an hour, buddy.</font>

465
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:42,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, this drink tastes like bleach.</font>

466
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm dipping them in bleach
so that I can clean them faster.</font>

467
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time to
wash every single glass.</font>

468
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dip it in bleach, then it's clean!</font>

469
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:50,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not drinking bleach.</font>

470
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:51,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then get out of my bar!</font>

471
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my bar!</font>

472
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:52,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to see you.</font>

473
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your buddy?</font>

474
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go with him.</font>

475
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't even know him.</font>

476
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even know him.</font>

477
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, become friends,
and you walk home!</font>

478
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!</font>

479
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

480
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, man?</font>

481
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, dude, is
that I'm completely overwhelmed.</font>

482
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:07,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suck at bartending.</font>

483
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going crazy.</font>

484
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's yelling at me.</font>

485
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're getting all pissed off.</font>

486
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:11,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is your face shiny?</font>

487
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had my skin
peeled off wh chemicals.</font>

488
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

489
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to know why?</font>

490
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.</font>

491
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just, uh, you
know, I've created a level of</font>

492
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">success for myself that, uh, I
just don't know if I can live up</font>

493
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">to it anymore, man.</font>

494
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">My level of excellence is so high
that I'm feeling the pressures, man.</font>

495
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:28,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I'm operating at
such an excellent level.</font>

496
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:29,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's insane.</font>

497
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:32,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'm running at of ten
of excellence, and I'm used to</font>

498
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">being at whatever number.</font>

499
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I don't even want to be at a—
like, somewhere lower, but whatever.</font>

500
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is that I'm not
going to let the bar down.</font>

501
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean?</font>

502
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">He being on the tipping point is
about working hard and caring</font>

503
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">about that work and really
giving it your all.</font>

504
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:46,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get high in the back office.</font>

505
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get high and
drop all this, right?</font>

506
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

507
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, you got to— all you
have to do is hold the pigeon,</font>

508
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I stick the M80 under
its wing, I blow it up.</font>

509
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:28,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Frank.</font>

510
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to help
you detonate a pigeon.</font>

511
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be terrible publicity
for a young comedienne.</font>

512
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you-you don't
have to do anything.</font>

513
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just— we stick the pigeon
in there, we run, the flock</font>

514
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">blows up, we got a lot of tasty meat.</font>

515
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:39,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, hold on.</font>

516
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:40,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

517
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a pigeon feast.</font>

518
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:41,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. What's going on?</font>

519
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everyone?</font>

520
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have all kinds of new
bits and no audience.</font>

521
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:45,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

522
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we tipped too soon.</font>

523
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:47,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

524
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just starting to
get a taste of success.</font>

525
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more.</font>

526
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

527
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:52,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Music.</font>

528
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming from in the back.</font>

529
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:55,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back here?</font>

530
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

531
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! What the hell are you
ck bags doing back here?</font>

532
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bar is completely empty.</font>

533
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm watching Charlie do his
thing, and it's good, man.</font>

534
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's, like, good.</font>

535
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like we did tip, Deandra.</font>

536
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might as well sin and get high.</font>

537
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm a sinner, too, right?</font>

538
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:14,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ho, ho.</font>

539
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:16,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mac's the best.</font>

540
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:17,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love him.</font>

541
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:18,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't he?</font>

542
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I'm pro-abortion, so I'm
probably going straight to hell.</font>

543
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, and I got fat.</font>

544
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:24,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm much fatter than Mac.</font>

545
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:27,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so fat, and, uh...
♪ Oh, big, fat, big, fat Big, fat titties</font>

00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not exactly sure how that
conversation went, but I imagine</font>

551
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was along those lines.</font>

552
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:41,052

they dropped a bomb on me.</font>

precaution of boiling the blood</font>

you boil it, Charlie.</font>

Frank's blood with bags of blood</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But... wait, wait.</font>

562
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just won't work.</font>

567
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,379

571
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it.</font>

572
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,052

00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the avatar that we're
going to get to do all of</font>

576
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">our work for us, so I can go
sailing, and-and Dee can tell</font>

577
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">her stupid jokes, and Dennis can
pour more acid on his face.</font>

578
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we still doing that?</font>

579
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We-We gave that plan
up a really long time ago.</font>

580
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:25,932

your face for six weeks?</font>

581
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I've been trying to get as
big as my avatar, so we don't tip.</font>

00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, that was, like,
a million plans ago.</font>

00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh-Where have you been?</font>

586
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys dropped the tipping plan?</font>

587
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:39,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

588
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were just putting it on
the back burner until I hit two hundo.</font>

589
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think we've been
calling you fat this entire time?</font>

590
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:48,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh... Why wouldn't somebody
tell me that we dropped the plan?</font>

591

00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to be perfectly honest.</font>

620
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't know what
you want me to do.</font>

621
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, um, let me start at the
beginning, because clearly,</font>

622
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't understand it.</font>

623
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:50,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no
, hat won't be necessary.</font>

624
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:53,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, if, uh... if I smite your friends
and absolve you, will you leave?</font>

625
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

626
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,082

your friends are smited.</font>

627
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:59,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Spirit, please leave.</font>

628
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:00,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great.</font>

629
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:03,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um, when should I see the results?</font>

630
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

631
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when does the spell kick in?</font>

632
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh-When is God going to shed
some of this weight for me?</font>

633
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:09,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six weeks.</font>

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not hard. Perfect.</font>

636
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:16,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, glory unto you, ghost man in
the sky, that created us all and</font>
