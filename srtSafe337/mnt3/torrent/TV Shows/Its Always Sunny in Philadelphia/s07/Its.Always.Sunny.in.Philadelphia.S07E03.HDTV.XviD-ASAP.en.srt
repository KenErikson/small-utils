kings in this country.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't
think we ever had kings.</font>

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:07,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the whole point of this
country is that we didn't want a king.</font>

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:08,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't want the king.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

11
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:18,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you broke your nose.</font>

12
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm screwed. I'm screwed. Ah!</font>

13
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, strange man, titty bar.</font>

14
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:25,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great investment opportunity.</font>

15
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beauty pageant.</font>

16
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:27,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you getting it?</font>

17
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, I think I got this.</font>

18
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You met a strange man at a titty
bar who offered you a great</font>

19
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">opportunity to invest
in a beauty pageant?</font>

20
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything looked very legit.</font>

21
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:37,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all in place.</font>

22
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had all the connections.</font>

23
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted somebody
to front the money.</font>

24
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:42,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me. Okay, fine.</font>

25
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted to
do a beauty pageant.</font>

26
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:45,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Why?</font>

27
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you make a lot of cash,
and you ogle some broads.</font>

28
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't question
that aspect of it.</font>

29
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:52,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that seems right
up your alley, bro.</font>

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this jerk gets pinched
for coming on to one of the</font>

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">contestants, and now it
looks like a whole scam.</font>

32
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I don't legitimize this
thing, everybody's gonna think</font>

33
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:02,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just like him.</font>

34
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just
drop the whole thing?</font>

35
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:05,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, Charlie.</font>

36
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:06,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's already going.</font>

37
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:07,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in motion.</font>

38
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's really a mess.</font>

39
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any second now, there's gonna be broads
walking through that door in swimsuits.</font>

40
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

41
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good thing.</font>

42
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:17,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't see what the
problem is here, Frank.</font>

43
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:21,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Looks like somebody
forgot their swimsuit.</font>

44
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:25,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, girls.</font>

45
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the problem.</font>

Are you kidding me?</font>

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,867

a kids' pageant.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy didn't make that clear.</font>

51

<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm lumped in
with a diddler.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I gonna do?</font>

53

54
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know
what the big deal is.</font>

55
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I did pageants all
the time when I was little.</font>

56
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">The big deal?</font>

57
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">The big deal is that mothers
force their kids into this so</font>

58
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:16,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they can dress them up like dolls
and parade them around like sex objects.</font>

59
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:17,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's creepy.</font>

60
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother didn't
force me into it.</font>

61
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:20,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I entered them myself.</font>

62
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's true.</font>

63
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, when Dee used to enter
pageants when we were kids, Mom</font>

64
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:25,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">used to tell her not to waste her time,
because she isn't pretty enough.</font>

65
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm, she would say that, and
then I would jam it right in</font>

66
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:28,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">her face when I'd win them.</font>

67
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you win pageants?</font>

68
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:30,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have a different face?</font>

69
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she was a dog
back then, too.</font>

70
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that
she worked at it.</font>

71
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">She used to go to tanning, and you
know, she practiced with her makeup.</font>

72
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you that— you did
a lot of that practicing.</font>

73
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Frank.</font>

74
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, you guys got to change
your thinking about child pageants.</font>

75
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, child pageants— that's
American tradition right there.</font>

76
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Child pageantry.</font>

77
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:46,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it.</font>

78
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">In other countries, okay, women that
can't show their ankles, right?</font>

79
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got to be in those big,
black tarps or whatever.</font>

80
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

81
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">In America, we can show toddlers
in tiny bikinis, we can</font>

82
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">make them tan, because
that's our right.</font>

83
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

84
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">As Americans, okay.</font>

85
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Child pageantry is an essential
part of the American fabric.</font>

86
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:01,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

87
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should dress up our little kids
just to show other people that we can.</font>

88
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:05,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

89
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, I never thought
about it that way.</font>

90
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about
freedom, isn't it?</font>

91
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

92
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can do whatever we
want with our kids.</font>

93
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

94
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what
America is all about.</font>

95
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you
just did, Charlie?</font>

96
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just loaded up that train
with coal, and now it's ready to</font>

97
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">tear down the tracks.</font>

98
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was inspiring as hell.</font>

99
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

100
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's throw ourselves a pageant!</font>

U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!</font>

104

105
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Thank you. Good.</font>

106
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,994

113

<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not my thing.</font>

00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:10,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me.</font>

153
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's in charge here?</font>

154
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, usually that's whoever
yells the loudest, but I am the</font>

00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

162
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:31,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you know, I... I'm-I'm pretty much...
I'm in charge of this... the</font>

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

165
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:36,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's a guy.</font>

166
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,665

you want to talk to.</font>

169
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:48,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might be this way, so I'll go...
I'm gonna go back here and look for him.</font>

00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you check it out
around the corner.</font>

171
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real jacked up face and fat.</font>

172
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:57,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how's everyone doing today?</font>

173
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everyone feeling safe?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The F.A.P.C., huh?</font>

175
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what he said.</font>

178
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we're fine, Frank.</font>

179
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got nothing to hide.</font>

180
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know what?</font>

181
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest with you, I'm
glad he's gonna observe us.</font>

182
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, somebody should be
looking out for these kids.</font>

183
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, those mothers just left
their kids here in a bar with</font>

00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:18,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

187
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:19,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a mess!</font>

188
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, why don't you go lay

190
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Jesus, Frank, fix
your face, for God sake.</font>

191
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

192
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

everything in here.</font>

00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:30,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's gonna
be fine, Frank.</font>

196
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we got it. We got it.</font>

197
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:32,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all gonna be fine.</font>

198
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you pinned the whole
thing on him, right?</font>

199
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:35,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, of course I did.</font>

200
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, good thinking.</font>

201
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Good, good, good, good.</font>

202
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:41,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, ladies, chins up,
hands down, step forward.</font>

203
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:44,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three, one, two.</font>

204
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:46,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fan, turn. Hit it! Stick it!</font>

205
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see it!</font>

00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pose!</font>

207
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, hit the line.</font>

208
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in line. What is this?</font>

209
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:54,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we got to put on a show!</font>

210
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were
professionals.</font>

211
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm looking for,
and I don't see professionals.</font>

212
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:08,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see amateurs, I see trash, little
pieces of trash on my stage.</font>

213
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are dummies.</font>

214
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not even hard.</font>

215
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are dumb.</font>

216
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not hard.</font>

217
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samantha's mean.</font>

218
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:20,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samantha gets to be mean
because Samantha is a star, okay?</font>

219
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one day you'll be a star,
but right now you're not.</font>

220
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're junk.</font>

221
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

222
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:25,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You belong in the bathroom.</font>

223
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

224
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take a five,
let's take a break.</font>

225
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:28,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so upset.</font>

226
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

227
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing great.</font>

228
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be dressed very stylishly
for the performance.</font>

229
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be a great
performance, Walter, very classy.</font>

230
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look forward to seeing it.</font>

231
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just make sure that the
children are featured.</font>

232
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is who this is about.</font>

233
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

234
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... it's about the kids.</font>

235
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:45,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, all about
the kids, yeah.</font>

236
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:46,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, yeah, no, totally.</font>

237
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Walter, you want
to come sit with us?</font>

238
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, come sit sith...

show, you guys, we got to.</font>

work out there, Samantha.</font>

246
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't get sassy with me.</font>

247
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,803

you a compliment.</font>

248
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,939

of myself in you.</font>

249
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,940

253
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the meanest
girl in the world.</font>

254
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what?</font>

255
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better thank your lucky
stars I'm not in this</font>

256
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">competition because I would
eat you for breakfast.</font>

yourself, Samantha.</font>

266
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

267
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:44,197

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet he's never
won one of these.</font>

few adjustments to the song,</font>

306
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe update it a little bit.</font>

307
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the song needs an update.</font>

308
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these old patriotic
songs need updates.</font>

309
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they're like
200 years old.</font>

310
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why nobody wants
to listen to 'em.</font>

Ah, I know, but I'm the adult</font>

so that's what's gonna happen.</font>

win this pageant, don't you?</font>

325
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just said a
lot of bad words.</font>

326
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,311

you are going to win this pageant.</font>

330
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:43,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you excited?</font>

331
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you excited about that?</font>

332
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't really
care about any of that.</font>

333
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:49,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but it's not what you care
about, it's what I care about.</font>

00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:50,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

335

<font color="#FFFFFF">What on earth did you
do to your face?</font>

350
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had it done at a funeral home.</font>

351
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, why, why?</font>

352
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where in the hell am I going to go— to
the goddamn makeup counter at Macy's?</font>

353
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go to a funeral home
to get gruesome repairs.</font>

354
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:27,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

355
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like you're
at your own wake.</font>

356
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:35,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Frank, I need some water.</font>

357
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:39,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mouth is dry.</font>

358
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mouth is dry.</font>

359
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:45,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go into the toilet and run
your mouth under the sink.</font>

360
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

361
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, can I, could I, can I?</font>

362
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a... Who's that?</font>

363
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:51,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the mortician.</font>

364
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:51,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invited him.</font>

365
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you brought the mortician.</font>

366
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, that's not going to
seem strange to anybody at all.</font>

367
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figure he's a cretin.</font>

368
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I have a cretin like that
near me if I have something to hide?</font>

369
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm... Associating with a man like
that's not going to make you</font>

370
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">look any better.</font>

371
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey,
you're on in five.</font>

372
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:04,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, whoa.</font>

373
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Artemis, what are
you doing here?</font>

374
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's working the
soundboard, okay, relax.</font>

375
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:08,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a good idea?</font>

376
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know how to
work a soundboard?</font>

377
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else are we going to get?</font>

378
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have a very
deep bench, dude.</font>

379
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

380
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get high
before the show.</font>

381
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

382
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like a bad idea.</font>

383
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't get high.</font>

384
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's making us look bad.</font>

385
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:21,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sweating like a pig.</font>

386
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to get my makeup redone.</font>

387
