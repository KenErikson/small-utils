00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay,
what would you do, Dee?</font>

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:04,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying that if I
were a cop, I would have an Uzi.</font>

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:07,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, but I'm saying that the
police force would never issue</font>

4
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:07,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">you an Uzi, so now what?</font>

5
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not
her point, though.</font>

6
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what we're talking about, that's not my...
Thank you, Charlie.</font>

7
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:13,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, if you had the choice,
would you choose to carry one</font>

8
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">gun that shoots one bullet or
would you choose to carry an</font>

9
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uzi— one gun that shoots a
thousand bullets in one second?</font>

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're shooting
bullets everywhere.</font>

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:20,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree with her 100%.</font>

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right?
- I mean, she's absolutely right.</font>

13
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got people coming at
you from every angle.</font>

14
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:28,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, honestly, if you're going to join
in the conversation, will you swallow</font>

15
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">your food and then speak?</font>

16
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:30,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's disgusting.</font>

17
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, hey, Frank, what
are you eating over there?</font>

18
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hoagie.</font>

19
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not eating a hoagie.</font>

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are just jamming meats and
cheeses inside of your mouth.</font>

21
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to make it in my mouth.</font>

22
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">It tastes better.</font>

23
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie?</font>

24
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gino?</font>

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You piece of shit!</font>

26
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:56,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch!</font>

27
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you, I'll kill
you, I'll kill you!</font>

28
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is interesting.</font>

29
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:00,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

31
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:03,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, do we break this up?</font>

32
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:04,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, n-no, d-don't
break it up.</font>

33
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:07,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see how this
whole thing plays out.</font>

34
00:01:10,543 --> 00:01:11,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

35
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, that
seemed to settle it.</font>

36
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

37
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right,
okay, all right.</font>

38
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:20,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, Frank, who
the hell is this man?</font>

39
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:22,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">My goddamn brother.</font>

41
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I had no idea
you had a brother.</font>

42
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:51,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what gives, Frank?</font>

43
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told us your
brother was dead.</font>

44
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you said that he had
his guts sucked out of his</font>

45
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">asshole through a hot tub drain.</font>

46
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told that to my
own niece and nephew?</font>

47
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, well, technically, sir, he's
not our father, which would</font>

48
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:02,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">mean you're not our uncle.</font>

49
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we thought he was for a
long time, and then as it turns</font>

50
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">out... You know what?</font>

51
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a whole thing, so...
Yeah, let's not get into it.</font>

52
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:07,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do
this to me, Frankie?</font>

53
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:09,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do what, Gino?</font>

54
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:10,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm talking about.</font>

55
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to
steal her from me.</font>

56
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:14,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's my woman.</font>

57
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole her from me first.</font>

58
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you stole her back.</font>

59
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, who the hell
are you guys talking about?</font>

60
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">The love of my life.</font>

61
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:23,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this just got
more interesting.</font>

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna pull up a
seat and get into it.</font>

63
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">This just got very
interesting, Frank.</font>

64
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you walk
us through this?</font>

65
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not dragging
this shit up again.</font>

66
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ancient history.</font>

67
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I think
they need to hear this.</font>

68
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they need to hear what a
liar and a cheat their father is.</font>

69
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:40,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me start at the beginning.</font>

70
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:42,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was back in the '60s.</font>

71
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna jump in for a
second 'cause it sounds like</font>

72
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:46,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're about to launch
into a whole thing.</font>

73
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it going to
take a long time?</font>

74
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">My attention span
is very short.</font>

75
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a valid concern.</font>

76
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll take as long as it takes.</font>

77
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah... okay.</font>

78
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we might pop
in and out mentally.</font>

79
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know, our generation— it's like...
Yeah, you want to make it</font>

80
00:02:58,684 --> 00:02:59,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">funny or something?</font>

81
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it some flair.</font>

82
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:04,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, it was in the '60s.</font>

83
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:08,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were looking for me,
you'd find me at a happening</font>

84
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">little jazz club on the
north side of town.</font>

85
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:14,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an all-black joint.</font>

86
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blacks played the best music.</font>

87
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I gave a
shit— I got a tin ear.</font>

88
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all sounded like a
bunch of noise to me.</font>

89
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I was running numbers
as a bookie for the club.</font>

90
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd take bets for
the owner Reggie.</font>

91
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Gino.</font>

92
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a temper.</font>

93
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:33,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">He also had a weakness for betting horses
and a strength for losing those bets.</font>

94
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:39,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Reggie owed me money, and when
he came up short, I called in a favor.</font>

95
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:40,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to hire someone.</font>

96
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't hiring another one
of your bimbos, Gino.</font>

97
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:46,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bimbo is my little brother.</font>

98
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here every night
for the music.</font>

99
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's more Negro-ish than
anybody else in this club.</font>

100
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie.</font>

101
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gino.</font>

102
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to work here?</font>

103
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would I ever?</font>

104
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:59,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love the music, sir.</font>

105
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:00,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a kid.</font>

106
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old are you, boy?</font>

107
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nineteen.</font>

108
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, you don't
look a day over 12.</font>

109
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do anything.</font>

110
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was looking out for
my younger brother.</font>

111
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was keeping him
out of trouble.</font>

112
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Frankie a job
and he loved it.</font>

113
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a shit job.</font>

114
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was mopping up puke, I was
busing tables and washing dishes.</font>

115
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stunk.</font>

116
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ <i>So far, so good... </i> ♪</font>

117
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at least I had that sweet
music to keep me going.</font>

118
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ <i>So far, so good... </i> ♪</font>

119
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then one night I heard
the voice of an angel.</font>

120
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not her.</font>

121
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ So far, so good ♪</font>

122
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ <i>So far, so good</i> ♪</font>

123
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:38,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep going.</font>

would be long gone... ♪</font>

125
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's her.</font>

126
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ <i>So far, so good... </i> ♪</font>

127
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, she was the cat's meow.</font>

128
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:50,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was Shadynasty.</font>

129
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to stop you.</font>

130
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good time to stop.</font>

131
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:58,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so... The love of your life
was a black woman named Shadynasty?</font>

132
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

133
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's wrong with that?</font>

134
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, th-th-there's
nothing wrong with it.</font>

135
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:03,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of things.</font>

136
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:04,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's strange, it's strange.</font>

137
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just unexpected.</font>

138
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's strange.</font>

139
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:07,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty.</font>

140
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:08,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, go on, though.</font>

141
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:08,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

142
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:13,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, so it was late one night, I
was cleaning up, doing my usual routine.</font>

143
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of
your goddamn mind?</font>

144
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you with her.</font>

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitch, if I want to be with another
woman, I'll be with another woman.</font>

146
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, relax.</font>

147
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax, relax, be cool,
daddy-o, be cool.</font>

148
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gino, get this bitch
out of my sight.</font>

149
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just be cool, man,

bitch, goddamn.</font>

151
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Frankie here is gonna take you
home and I'm gonna talk to Reggie.</font>

152
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He old enough to drive?</font>

153
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

154
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:51,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a while, we drove in silence until I
finally got the nerve to speak to her.</font>

155
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a huge set on you.</font>

156
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

157
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:58,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pipes— you got a great voice.</font>

158
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:03,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

159
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:05,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like black music?</font>

160
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I?</font>

161
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna open a jazz joint of
my own someday— an integrated</font>

whites can get along.</font>

00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:16,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Orientals, though.</font>

164
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:19,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to have a
dream, I guess.</font>

165
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're going to be
my star attraction.</font>

166
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Child, I ain't nothing
but a backup singer.</font>

167
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, you're the real,
true star, Shadynasty.</font>

168
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:34,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just need a
sky to shine in.</font>

169
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:38,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I didn't know better, I'd
think you were flirting with me.</font>

170
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">White man. Get down.</font>

171
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, why were you
shoving her head down?</font>

172
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:47,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not want to be caught out in the
street in those days with a Negress.</font>

173
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd tear you apart.</font>

174
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negress?</font>

175
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

176
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever the proper word was.</font>

177
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not that,
it's a different word.</font>

178
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't that.</font>

179
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking '60s terms.</font>

180
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

181
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:57,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

182
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you used those terms.</font>

183
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't have.</font>

184
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you open the club or what?</font>

185
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bet your ass I did.</font>

186
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">With hard work
and perseverance.</font>

187
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit. We opened the club
with my gambling money.</font>

188
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's when we became
business partners.</font>

189
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:15,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, we opened the club, and
we named it after our star attraction.</font>

190
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:22,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shady-nasty's?</font>

191
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty's, asshole.</font>

192
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.</font>

00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out of here.</font>

194
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you spell it?</font>

195
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:34,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">So business was booming.</font>

196
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:38,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Like fire needs the
air to breathe... ♪</font>

197
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,075

210
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,852

take my best bitch.</font>

00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disappear?
Where am I going to disappear to?</font>

303
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to get you
to South America.</font>

304
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got connections.</font>

305
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:06,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">South America?</font>

306
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:07,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Shadynasty?</font>

307
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna look after Shadynasty.</font>

308
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:10,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie!</font>

309
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty!</font>

310
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:12,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie!</font>

311
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Shadynasty!</font>

312
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:25,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I started
my new life.</font>

313
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colombia.</font>

314
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:30,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a dump.</font>

315
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gino scored me a job all right.</font>

316
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was quality control for his
Colombian cocaine connection.</font>

317
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd become everything I hated.</font>

318
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:50,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that kept me going
was writing letters to Shadynasty.</font>

319
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:53,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote her every night.</font>

320
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I never heard back.</font>

321
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty!</font>

322
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I occupied my mind immersing
myself in the culture.</font>

323
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking in the cuisine.</font>

324
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">But mostly doing cocaine.</font>

325
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

326
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">That part was a blast actually.</font>

327
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:31,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weeks turned into months, and
months turned into years.</font>

328
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I had to wean myself off.</font>

329
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:44,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was living life just
going through the motions.</font>

330
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I had to get back home.</font>

331
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to Shadynasty.</font>

332
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

333
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't be calling.</font>

334
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too risky.</font>

335
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little birdie wants
to fly back to the cage.</font>

336
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too close to the stove.</font>

337
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's too much heat.</font>

338
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little birdie
can stand the heat.</font>

339
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:08,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to migrate home.</font>

340
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little birdie can't come home
on account of the attempted murder!</font>

341
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you say that, Gino?</font>

342
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used my name.</font>

343
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:17,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to hang up now.</font>

344
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't come home, Frankie.</font>

345
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you used my name!</font>

346
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,984

347
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,319

<font color="#FFFFFF">So I snuck into the States.</font>

349
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:39,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what I saw when I
got home made me sick.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

369
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:40,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said that you were
gone, and I was here.</font>

370
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:45,523

<font color="#FFFFFF">Break it up.</font>

389
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have had
any girl you wanted.</font>

390
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was my one and only.</font>

391
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole her from me.</font>

392
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're stealing her from me.</font>

393
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:45,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found the new love letters you've
been writing to her, Frankie.</font>

394
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:47,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talking about meeting up
again and running away.</font>

395
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

396
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't written
to her in years.</font>

397
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit!</font>

398
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all signed, "Love,
your one and only."</font>

399
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have destroyed these, like I
destroyed the letters from Colombia.</font>

400
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

401
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:07,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You destroyed the letters
I wrote to Shadynasty?</font>

402
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I intercepted and I
read every one of them.</font>

403
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were poetry.</font>

404
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one was more
beautiful than the last.</font>

405
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too beautiful, though.</font>

406
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't let
Shadynasty read them.</font>

407
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if she was going
to stay with me.</font>

408
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:28,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">But these letters—
these are smut.</font>

409
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I want to be in you.</font>

410
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dick is a raging
bull for you."</font>

411
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:39,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this one, here, "Meet me at the
airport, Friday, at 5:00, Terminal C.</font>

412
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love, your one and only."</font>

413
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:43,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are trying to steal her from me,
Frankie, and I ain't gonna let you.</font>

414
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gino, Gino.</font>

415
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not me.</font>

416
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, I
never wrote those.</font>

417
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:51,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

418
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:53,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm putting something
together here.</font>

419
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's at the airport right
now meeting some dude.</font>

420
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, like, if you want to try and
get her back, you got to move.</font>

421
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, it's almost 5:00.</font>

422
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'd like to see this
whole story play out.</font>

423
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's appealing to
the romantic in me.</font>

424
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I want to see it.</font>

425
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man.</font>

426
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go to the airport.</font>

427
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:07,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

428
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, go.</font>

429
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the gate.</font>

430
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see a black
woman anywhere.</font>

431
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

432
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, there's her, but...
That's her!</font>

433
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:21,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

434
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? That is not at all
what I was picturing.</font>

435
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:24,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

436
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, right?</font>

437
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty.</font>

438
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie!</font>

439
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:30,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my word!</font>

440
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:34,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're still as
beautiful as ever.</font>

441
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

442
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:40,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know, I wrote to you every
single day from South America.</font>

443
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I really feel like
we could still be together.</font>

444
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's still a chance for us.</font>

445
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadynasty, I'm sorry
for whatever I did.</font>

446
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, don't go.</font>

447
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't choose Gino, choose me.</font>

448
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, you choose me.</font>

449
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have loved you all my life.</font>

450
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, pick me.</font>

451
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

452
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:55,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our love was strong.</font>

453
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:56,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were together.</font>

454
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:57,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick me, pick me.</font>

455
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:58,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick me, Shadynasty.</font>

456
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:02,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but I pick him.</font>

457
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't this some shit.</font>

458
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie.</font>

459
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie?</font>

460
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, everyone's a lot fatter
than I was expecting them to be.</font>

461
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:10,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

462
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time I saw you, Frankie,
you had me sent to jail.</font>

463
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:15,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I forgive you.</font>

464
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:16,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all in the past.</font>

465
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie is your one
and only, huh?</font>

466
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was all along.</font>

467
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:24,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">But because of you two,
he was always in jail.</font>

468
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never be with him.</font>

469
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, Mr. Mohamed?</font>

470
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

471
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name came up
on a no-fly list.</font>

472
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:32,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to come with us.</font>

473
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hell no.</font>

474
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to be
getting on this flight.</font>

475
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, please cooperate.</font>

476
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm getting on that
plane with Shadynasty.</font>

477
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:41,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

478
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take him down.</font>

479
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Oh, hell no!</font>

480
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Times have changed!</font>

481
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't still be like this!</font>

482
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him be.</font>

483
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie? No!</font>

484
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you call that in?</font>

485
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:54,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that just happened.</font>

486
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:57,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... Guess times kind of
haven't changed much, huh?</font>

487
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm being honest,
she looked like shit.</font>

488
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

489
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:00,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

490
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did not age well at all.</font>

491
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

492
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:04,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she ever look good?</font>

493
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was never attractive.</font>

494
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess black can crack.</font>

495
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's still...
still kind of racist.</font>

496
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's racist.</font>

497
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:12,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anybody hungry?</font>

498
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm hungry.</font>

499
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starving.</font>

500
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:15,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's go eat.</font>

501
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, did Frankie ever tell you
about the time that I threw</font>

502
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">him off the John
Wanamaker Building?</font>

503
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:21,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch.</font>

504
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told us about that.</font>

505
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't— I can't listen
to another goddamn story.</font>

506
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear that story.</font>
