00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you
guys wanna do today?</font>

2
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- We could sing a song.</font>

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just ate.</font>

4
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're drinking.</font>

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know what?</font>

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:12,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac's coming over here pretty soon...
Mac's always got something...</font>

7
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll have a plan...
He always has something.</font>

8
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:15,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he'll get us
into something good.</font>

9
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">He comes in with something.</font>

10
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:16,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">He comes in hot.</font>

11
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:17,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll be perfect.</font>

12
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I feel like we're having a hard
time getting into something good today.</font>

13
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:20,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is! There he is!</font>

14
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good timing!</font>

15
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:23,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac in the house.</font>

16
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:23,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac in the house.</font>

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac in the house.</font>

18
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got some news?</font>

19
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:27,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got some news for me?</font>

20
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lay it on us.</font>

21
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the news?</font>

22
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your news?</font>

23
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:30,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, what's your news?</font>

24
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:31,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us the news.</font>

25
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't have any news.</font>

26
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you guys had news.</font>

27
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always come
in hot with news.</font>

28
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what's the plan?</font>

29
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:36,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I got nothin'.</font>

30
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

31
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Oh.</font>

32
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:38,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's disappointing.</font>

33
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You usually fire in
here with something.</font>

34
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

35
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've actually been
kinda bored today.</font>

36
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're bored over here.</font>

37
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:44,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys bored, too?</font>

38
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are bored out of
our goddamn minds.</font>

39
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got no plan?
Didn't run into a thing or...?</font>

40
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Don't you remember, love
We built this city...</font>

41
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">We built this city on
rock 'n' roll... ♪</font>

42
00:00:56,298 --> 00:01:00,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... wait... guys...
I know what we can do.</font>

43
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

44
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:05,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's play "Chardee MacDennis."</font>

45
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:06,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Yes!</font>

46
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:07,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

47
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no... No!
'Cause we're not playing!</font>

48
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:10,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

49
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's
"Chardee MacDennis"?</font>

50
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:13,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

51
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Chardee MacDennis" is an awesome
board game that we came</font>

52
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">up with, many years ago,
on a day much like today.</font>

53
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:18,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like fun.</font>

54
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:20,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're not playing it!</font>

55
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:21,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not playing it!</font>

56
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't start chanting it, 'cause
we're not playing that stupid game!</font>

57
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not playing that game!</font>

58
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:27,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What's the big deal?</font>

59
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only a game.</font>

60
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just a game!</font>

61
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:33,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a war.</font>

Now what we did is we took</font>

64
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">our favorite aspects of a bunch
of different board games and we</font>

65
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">mashed 'em all together.</font>

66
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did the same thing with the name,
'cause we couldn't agree upon one.</font>

67
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the point of the game is
actually quite simple: It's a</font>

68
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">race to the finish from
Level One to Level Three.</font>

69
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the board, and we start
at Level One, which is "Mind."</font>

70
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">That consists of "Trivia,"</font>

71
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Puzzles" and "Artistry."</font>

72
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is also the level at which the
alcohol being consumed is wine.</font>

73
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:26,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

74
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get to drink
during the game?</font>

75
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, drinking is the game, Frank.
It's the whole point of it.</font>

76
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to play any game in
which I'm not getting annihilated.</font>

77
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving on to Level Two, which is
"Physical Challenge,"</font>

78
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:37,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pain" and "Endurance."</font>

79
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the beer level.</font>

80
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:42,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and Level Three is
"Emotional Battery"</font>

81
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:43,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and "Public Humiliation."</font>

82
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom— hard alcohol level.</font>

83
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell you
doing, Deandra?</font>

84
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is very
important, Frank.</font>

85
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta nail the board down to
the bar, because, at a certain</font>

86
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:54,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">point during the game, Mac can get
very pissed off, 'cause he's</font>

87
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">not doing very well.</font>

88
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna try and
flip the board over.</font>

89
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right; it's for the best.</font>

90
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will forget, later,
that it's nailed down.</font>

91
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He will.
- Okay, here's the big one:</font>

92
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a 15-minute
time limit to the game.</font>

93
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">15 minutes doesn't seem like
a long time for a game.</font>

94
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's a fair amount
of a clock stoppages.</font>

95
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:10,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, each team gets three
time-outs; there's a half-time;</font>

96
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">post-level breaks; a two-minute
warning and a significant amount</font>

97
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:13,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">of injury stoppages.</font>

98
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hence the first-aid kit.</font>

99
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, pay very close attention
to this first part: Each team</font>

100
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">must collect a certain number of
cards, at each level, in order</font>

101
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:22,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">to progress to the next level.</font>

102
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the first team to complete
all three levels wins the game.</font>

103
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:27,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the winner— ooh— the
winner gets a sweet prize.</font>

104
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice!</font>

105
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the prize?</font>

106
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:32,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">The winner gets to smash the
other team's game pieces.</font>

107
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the prize?</font>

108
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get to smash the
team's game pieces?</font>

109
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's incredibly gratifying.</font>

110
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's awesome, Frank.</font>

111
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:41,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now these are our game pieces.</font>

112
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice, right?</font>

113
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:47,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And... these...
- are Mac and Charlie's pieces.</font>

114
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the condition
that they're in.</font>

115
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty pathetic, as you can see
from the state that these pieces</font>

116
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:56,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">are in, Mac and Charlie have never, ever,
in the history of Chardee MacDennis,</font>

117
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">won the game.</font>

118
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never won?</font>

119
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never won once?</font>

120
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

121
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost statistically
impossible to play that many</font>

122
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">games and never win, but...
It's truly an anomaly.</font>

123
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't won yet, all right?
But maybe this is our time, all right?</font>

124
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, yeah, it
is gonna happen.</font>

125
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out! Watch out!</font>

126
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... I'm gonna slit throats.</font>

127
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

128
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ack! I love this game!</font>

129
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want in!</font>

130
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I want to be Mac
and Charlie's partner.</font>

131
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That seems fair to me.</font>

132
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

133
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll say why: Because, you
see, Frank's mind is still</font>

134
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">fairly strong, but his body's very,
very weak, so I think it's a wash.</font>

135
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">And his spirit's garbage,
so I'm okay with it, too.</font>

136
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a second, dude.</font>

137
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just
jump on our team.</font>

138
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us talk about this.</font>

139
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, first of all, we
got a team photo, right?</font>

140
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

141
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're gonna have to decide,
you know, do we get a</font>

142
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">new team photo with or without you...
Plus, we have a whole new</font>

143
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:43,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">strategy to come up with, you know...
Our strategy has never worked.</font>

144
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:44,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I hate the team photo.</font>

145
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:45,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what?</font>

146
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just join our team.</font>

147
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on the team.</font>

148
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

149
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.</font>

150
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.</font>

151
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and the Golden Geese are
very much looking forward to</font>

152
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">another annihilation.</font>

153
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are. Now... in the spirit of
tradition, I propose that we begin the</font>

154
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">ritual of sportsmanship.</font>

155
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck to you, sir.</font>

156
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, sir.</font>

157
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do hope you have
a good game, miss.</font>

158
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:14,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, sir.</font>

159
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the hell are youse
talkin' like that?</font>

160
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:18,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is an important
part of the process, Frank.</font>

161
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gives the illusion of
respect for your opponent.</font>

162
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are about to get real
dark, real quick, Frank.</font>

163
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to start off
on a positive note.</font>

164
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:27,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that reminds me: Once the
game begins, you are not allowed</font>

165
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:28,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">to ask any questions.</font>

166
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! In fact, if you do, don't
say a question, look it up</font>

167
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the book of rules, okay?</font>

168
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

169
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think I understand.</font>

170
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you haven't begun to understand,
Frank, but that's okay.</font>

171
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get it as we go along.</font>

172
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like every other board game.</font>

173
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, how much time?</font>

174
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, ten seconds.</font>

175
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Perfect!</font>

176
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:50,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, gentlemen... Suck my dick.</font>

177
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the shit are you doing?</font>

178
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it, Frank.</font>

179
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked a question!</font>

180
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

181
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Mac, Charlie—
drink for five seconds.</font>

182
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, drink, drink, drink!</font>

183
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how we get psyched
up before each level.</font>

184
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's our
Maori war dance.</font>

185
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how we demonstrate
intimidation.</font>

186
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shows off our physical prowess!</font>

187
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Dee, put two
more minutes on the clock.</font>

188
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:26,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

189
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:28,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

190
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen... Level One begins.</font>

191
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, first card is trivia.</font>

192
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Dee, answer this question
correctly, we get the card.</font>

193
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:40,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

194
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, they get a
chance to steal.</font>

195
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:42,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

196
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what is the
greatest band in the world?</font>

197
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chumbawamba.</font>

198
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct!</font>

199
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:46,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice!</font>

200
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! That's not trivia!</font>

201
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:48,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make sense.</font>

202
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">We made up all these questions, Frank,
so there's gonna be a lot of opinion.</font>

203
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, really, it's more of a
memory game than anything else.</font>

204
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">But drink.</font>

205
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:53,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink, bitch. Let's go.</font>

206
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, whatever.</font>

207
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our turn. Our turn.</font>

208
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go. Ready, Charlie?</font>

209
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

210
00:06:57,336 --> 00:07:00,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">No puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles... Trivia!</font>

211
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trivia!</font>

212
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do trivia, baby.</font>

213
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude, and you
definitely wrote this one.</font>

214
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:06,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. Lay it on me!</font>

215
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lay it on me!</font>

216
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dennis is asshole.</font>

217
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why Charlie hate"?</font>

218
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I wrote that.</font>

219
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:21,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You definitely wrote
this one, Charlie.</font>

220
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else would
have written this?</font>

221
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not remembering that.</font>

222
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:25,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

223
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:26,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I wrote that one.</font>

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you did.</font>

225
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many other illiterates
are in the...?</font>

226
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just throw out a guess.</font>

227
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:31,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass.</font>

228
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

229
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:32,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass, pass.</font>

230
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:34,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he didn't pass,
he didn't pass.</font>

231
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:35,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just throw out a guess.</font>

232
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any guess, come on.</font>

233
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass.</font>

234
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch!</font>

235
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:41,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlie.</font>

236
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:42,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't think of one.</font>

237
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, chance to steal.</font>

238
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Dennis is a bastard man.</font>

239
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what it is.</font>

240
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I definitely wrote that.</font>

241
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was it, right?</font>

242
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two card, two cards, two cards.</font>

243
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was mad at you about
something, I wrote that.</font>

244
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:55,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter.</font>

245
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:56,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next card is Artistry.</font>

246
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's all play, so
pay attention, guys.</font>

247
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">All play, all play.</font>

248
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get it back.</font>

249
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The artist from your team must
draw the clue from the card</font>

250
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">on your teammate's back.</font>

251
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">The teammate must guess the
clue based solely on feel."</font>

252
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready?</font>

253
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to pass the
card over to the drawer.</font>

254
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:11,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I draw, I draw.</font>

255
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't want
to have to read it.</font>

256
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:15,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is hard.</font>

257
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, ready... and...
You guys ready?</font>

258
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

259
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:18,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">begin.</font>

260
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go, go, go.</font>

261
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, go.</font>

262
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:21,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, uh, bird?</font>

263
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not getting it, dude.</font>

264
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because it's
impossible to draw.</font>

265
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how to dr...
Jesus, Dee, your back is so</font>

266
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">boney and crooked and all over the
place, I can't get a flat surface.</font>

267
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:29,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anger.</font>

268
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me have it.</font>

269
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:31,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let Frank go.</font>

270
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me try it.</font>

271
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, if only the answer was ribs.</font>

272
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, Frank, give me...
Kicking, kicking.</font>

273
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got it.</font>

274
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:39,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got it!</font>

275
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch.</font>

276
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kicking, kicking.</font>

277
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:45,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I forgot about your stupid
strange connection with each other.</font>

278
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get the card, we
get the the card.</font>

279
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:49,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink.</font>

280
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">No puzzles, no puzzles,
no puzzles, no puzzles.</font>

281
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chance.</font>

282
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chance.</font>

283
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a great one, Frank.</font>

284
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:56,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We stole this straight
from Monopoly.</font>

285
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be good,
it could be bad.</font>

286
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the chance.</font>

287
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

288
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's like the best one.</font>

289
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:04,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Take the money from
everyone's pockets."</font>

290
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:07,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

291
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:09,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foo-foo, fork over, foo-foo.</font>

292
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the best card there is.</font>

293
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I don't know what
you're so excited for.</font>

294
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:13,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your money.</font>

295
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, I'm on your team.</font>

296
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:19,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, the card says "Take the
money from everyone's pockets."</font>

297
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone. You are everyone.</font>

298
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie gave up his 50...
I got $500 in my pocket.</font>

299
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:23,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not putting my
money on the table.</font>

300
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:24,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to do it, dude.</font>

301
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:24,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

302
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:25,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the game.</font>

303
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a part of
the game, Frank.</font>

304
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:27,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see that card.</font>

305
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, if you're going to play the game...
Let me see that card.</font>

306
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're going to play the game...
Let me see the card!</font>

307
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a part of the game.</font>

308
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you show him the card.</font>

309
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him see the card.</font>

310
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Swallow this card whole."</font>

311
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:40,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheating! Cheating!</font>

312
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:41,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheating.</font>

313
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:42,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been caught cheating.</font>

314
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time's up.</font>

315
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:44,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been caught cheating.</font>

316
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the same team, dude.</font>

317
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Frank, cheating is
tolerated, it's accepted, it's</font>

318
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a big part of the game, but
if you get caught cheating, they</font>

319
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:52,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">advance to the next level.</font>

320
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ruined my scheme.</font>

321
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know, in his defense, you
were trying to steal his money.</font>

322
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:57,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

323
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was not the time
to cheat, dude.</font>

324
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy that.</font>

325
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one card down.</font>

326
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, it's too late now.</font>

327
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's done is done.</font>

328
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:02,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

329
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:06,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

330
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

331
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the Game of Games.</font>

332
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:14,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Frank, good,
you're getting it.</font>

333
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very civil.</font>

334
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can questions now I ask
that clock stop-ed?</font>

335
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, just 'cause you jumble up the
words doesn't make it not a question.</font>

336
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:25,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the answer is yes.</font>

337
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:29,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the clock is stopped, all
rules are off and civility reigns.</font>

338
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:30,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">They advance, do we?</font>

339
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, I'll explain
it to you, Frank.</font>

340
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can get a little confusing.</font>

341
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:35,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are now in Level Two.</font>

342
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means they need only two
cards to advance to Level Three.</font>

343
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:39,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are still in Level One.</font>

344
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a goddamn mind boggler.</font>

345
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I've never really
understood it, but the point is,</font>

346
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Mac's telling you
what to do, listen.</font>

347
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

348
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now at Level Two, there
is no more cursing.</font>

349
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

350
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big-time Level Two rule.</font>

351
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:51,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, where we at here?</font>

352
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we at?</font>

353
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gentlemen, it's time.</font>

354
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:55,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is it?</font>

355
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick it!</font>

356
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:08,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">You flinch, you lose.</font>

357
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:08,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

358
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:13,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't wince, all right.</font>

359
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. Not even a...
All right.</font>

360
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

361
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:17,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, come on.</font>

362
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

363
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is his hands are like...
So tiny.</font>

364
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Dee had gotten this, we could have just...
Obliterated those giant paws.</font>

365
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:24,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I got him.</font>

366
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to put it right
in the center of his hand.</font>

367
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it, do it.</font>

368
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese and crepes!</font>

369
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, hit him, hit him!</font>

370
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dadgumit!</font>

371
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me have a go at it.</font>

372
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, here.</font>

373
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

374
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for it.</font>

375
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for it.</font>

376
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:48,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese and crepes.</font>

377
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:49,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a gun.</font>

378
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese and crepes!</font>

379
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, we'll be taking this card.</font>

380
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese and crow.</font>

381
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, it's our turn.</font>

382
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go get the cards.</font>

383
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:01,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

384
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, puzzles, no, puzzles, no
puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles,</font>

385
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:08,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">no puzzles, no puzzles, no
puzzles, no puzzles... Chance.</font>

386
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, okay.</font>

387
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, could be good,
could be bad.</font>

388
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Go to jail.</font>

389
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:13,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not pass Go.</font>

390
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not collect $200."</font>

391
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:16,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam of a bush.</font>

392
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we take our pieces,
we put them in jail.</font>

393
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no, no.</font>

394
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, see, you don't get it.</font>

395
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no jail on the board.</font>

396
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you go in there.</font>

397
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to be kidding me.</font>

398
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, jail's a dog kennel.</font>

399
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get out, but you're
not going to like how.</font>

400
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to eat a cake.</font>

401
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's sounds good.</font>

402
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:35,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not.</font>

403
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to eat the
ingredients of a cake.</font>

404
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:38,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, shit.</font>

405
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, by one... Oh! No!</font>

406
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:40,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

407
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:41,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the clock!</font>

408
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude!</font>

409
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, I hate this game.</font>

410
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this game.</font>

411
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, all right,
we drink for five seconds.</font>

412
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not getting it.</font>

413
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Level Two, the
other team counts.</font>

414
00:12:55,818 --> 00:13:06,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four... five.</font>

415
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awful.</font>

416
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more cursing.</font>

417
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:15,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more cursing.</font>

418
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in jail.</font>

419
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:17,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

420
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might want to brush up on
some of these rules while you're</font>

421
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:20,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">in there too, pal.</font>

422
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:21,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

423
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:22,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good idea.</font>

424
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:23,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him read the rule book.</font>

425
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, our turn.</font>

426
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I'll play.</font>

427
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,684

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,553

more than five!</font>

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Level three!</font>

458
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Level three now!</font>

459
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, they're still inside me!</font>

460
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:12,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get them out!</font>

461
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter!</font>

462
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Golden Geese!</font>

463
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Golden Geese!</font>

464
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:20,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

465
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">We move on to Level Three!</font>

466
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this game!</font>

467
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this game!</font>

468
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now this part.</font>

469
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:27,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Oh, yes.</font>

470
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know this game.</font>

471
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Board flipping, cheating.</font>

472
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sick from
that cake stuff.</font>

473
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you shouldn't have even
eaten it, man, 'cause the game's</font>

474
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">gonna be over in,
like, a second.</font>

475
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:45,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna kill us.</font>

476
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second.</font>

477
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a plan.</font>

478
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was in the cage,
I had the books.</font>

479
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:52,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it, Frank.</font>

480
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way we can
beat them, okay?</font>

481
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:57,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are tailor-made
for level three.</font>

482
00:14:57,142 --> 00:15:00,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time we played, Dee got
"Emotional Battery," we berated</font>

483
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">that bitch for, like,
two straight hours.</font>

484
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, really personal stuff.</font>

485
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way over the line.</font>

486
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind of stuff that cuts
you to the core, you know.</font>

487
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">She held it together
without a single tear.</font>

488
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:12,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, when her two minutes were up,
she cried for a month straight.</font>

489
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it was really sad.</font>

490
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, crying all day long.</font>

491
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">She talked about
taking too many pills.</font>

492
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she tried
to kill herself.</font>

493
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did, she did.</font>

494
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it, but I didn't
tell you about it.</font>

495
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:22,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you bitches
ready for round three?</font>

496
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:25,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you're
going down, clowns.</font>

497
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, I want
to tell you something.</font>

498
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:36,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

499
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I get "Emotional
Battery" this time, from them,</font>

500
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:43,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">because this is why— you guys,
you always emotional batter me.</font>

501
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm gonna,
I'm fine with it.</font>

502
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:46,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't care about it.</font>

503
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting good at it now.</font>

504
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's something that
I hope for this game.</font>

505
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

506
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help you with that.</font>

507
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Frank.</font>

508
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, come on!</font>

509
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so I broke another rule.</font>

510
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:57,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you did?</font>

511
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke a rule?</font>

512
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't rat us out if it's a rule!</font>

513
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably not a rule.</font>

514
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:01,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's keep playing.</font>

515
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:02,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It probably is a rule.</font>

516
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:03,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it's a rule.</font>

517
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:04,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it is.</font>

518
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:08,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rule 463: When a player
spills his or her drink, his</font>

519
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">or her team has to chug
the opponent's drinks.</font>

520
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

521
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a terrible,
terrible teammate.</font>

522
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to chug hard alcohol
on top of all this wine.</font>

523
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:18,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like... No, that's okay,
you don't have to do it.</font>

524
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to, because
you guys are in Level One.</font>

525
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't even drink
hard alcohol, anyway.</font>

526
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:22,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to trick us.</font>

527
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to trick us
'cause then we'll not drink it</font>

528
00:16:24,972 --> 00:16:26,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it'll be a rule that
we had to drink it.</font>

529
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's fine.</font>

530
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:28,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">No tricking us.</font>

531
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:29,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we're playing the game.</font>

532
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:30,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're playing the game.</font>

533
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Chardee MacDennis.</font>

534
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">This tastes like water.</font>

535
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is water.</font>

536
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:39,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha! I knew it!</font>

537
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... I knew it was water.</font>

538
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he threw his beer in
my face, I could taste it.</font>

539
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, dog!</font>

540
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheaters!</font>

541
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... Cheaters.</font>

542
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:51,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been cheating!</font>

543
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We caught you cheating!</font>

544
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eff you in the A!</font>

545

00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:57,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, all right?</font>

547
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge on crackers, all right?</font>

548
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Falconing sons of birds!</font>

549
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother fathers, you've caught
us cheating for the first time</font>

550
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">in, like, 18 games.</font>

551
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:09,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the team ahead gets caught
cheating, then the team behind</font>

552
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">jumps to their level, which means...
Level Three!</font>

553
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:14,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Level Three!</font>

554
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Level Three!</font>

555
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

556
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've never been to
Level Three before!</font>

557
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:21,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to Level Three!</font>

558
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:22,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you in Level Three!</font>

559
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep, yep, yep, yep.</font>

560
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:28,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ The team going to Level Three We are
the team going to Level Three... ♪</font>

561
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the buzzer.</font>

562
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

563
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">The timer's never
gone off before.</font>

564
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, so what does that mean?</font>

565
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, look that up, because you
guys always win before the</font>

It means we have to draw the black card.</font>

567
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember a black card.</font>

568
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:49,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a black card?</font>

569
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:49,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember.</font>

570
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember a
black card at all.</font>

some dark shit right here.</font>

00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:54,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is.</font>

573
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:57,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be a
battle to the death.</font>

574
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

575
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, that's scary.</font>

576
00:17:59,101 --> 00:17:59,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, read it.</font>

577

579
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:02,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready.</font>

580
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:03,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here I go.</font>

581
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? What... I don't know.</font>

582
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why... I don't know.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we came up with?</font>

589

<font color="#FFFFFF">Flip a coin.</font>

590
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's lame as shit.</font>

00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now I remember.</font>

592
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we were writing the rules,
at one point, we just got really</font>

594
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so lame!</font>

595
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's awesome.</font>

596
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,503

they can't outsmart us.</font>

598

endurance or anything like that.</font>
