00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:05,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn! Burn! Burn!</font>

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:07,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!</font>

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:08,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn! Burn! Burn!</font>

4
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Burn, burn! Burn!</font>

5
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:12,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, cool.
What are you guys burning?</font>

6
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bunch of garbage</font>

7
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,794
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and burns the tar</i>
that's just taking up space.</font>

8
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:17,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, goddamn it!</font>

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Frank, why are
you burning our photo album pictures?</font>

10
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?
Because it's trash.</font>

11
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:23,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kidding me? Oh, my God!</font>

12
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, these are all the pictures</font>

13
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">from our Jersey Shore vacations.
You were gonna burn these?</font>

14
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:27,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">These were, like, the
happiest days of our lives.</font>

16
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Jersey
Shore sucked.</font>

17
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:32,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Shore didn't suck, Frank.</font>

18
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:33,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sucked, okay?</font>

19
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:36,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just complained the whole time
and ruined it for everyone else.</font>

20
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, because I had
to do all the work.</font>

21
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never got to relax.</font>

22
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:39,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would love to
go on a vacation.</font>

23
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, me, too.</font>

24
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would love to
go on a vacation.</font>

25
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:43,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but not to the
Jersey Shore, though.</font>

26
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that place
sounds like a nightmare.</font>

27
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with
the Jersey Shore?</font>

28
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
You've seen that TV show.</font>

29
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a bunch of sweaty
Guidos getting hopped up</font>

30
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">on energy drinks and giving
each other diseases.</font>

31
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, the Jersey Shore
is nothing like that.</font>

32
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:57,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a magical place where
people swim in the ocean and</font>

33
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">they get to ride on fun rides and
they get to have their first kiss.</font>

34
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:01,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you would love it.</font>

35
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:02,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hang on a second.</font>

36
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:03,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen the ocean.</font>

37
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could get into that if you guys
want to go down to the Shore.</font>

38
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:06,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, yes!</font>

39
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:07,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

40
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should all go to
the Shore together.</font>

41
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what.</font>

42
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll knock myself out and
we'll head down to the Shore.</font>

43
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I feel like you're
just gonna screw it up if you</font>

44
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:15,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">try and knock yourself out.</font>

45
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're probably gonna
come to halfway there, and then</font>

46
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">complain the rest of the time.</font>

47
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll tell you what.</font>

48
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:21,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't I take the rag, I'll
get the chloroform, I'll get you</font>

49
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you least expect it.</font>

50
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:24,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, sweet.</font>

51
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

52
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:26,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
Goin' down to the Jersey Shore!</font>

53
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:28,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, going to the Shore, baby!</font>

54
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this ocean,
explain it to me.</font>

55
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's, like, it goes on forever?</font>

56
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to sleep, go to sleep.</font>

58
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I woke up, like, halfway
there, and then you just</font>

59
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">snuffed me out again, huh, Mac?</font>

60
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this place turned
into a major shithole.</font>

61
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">It does not look exactly the
way I remember it looking.</font>

62
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:11,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's different,
it's different.</font>

63
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy at the front desk said
there was meth lab explosion,</font>

64
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:14,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the hotel burned down.</font>

65
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had to rebuild it.</font>

66
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:16,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something like that.</font>

67
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a smell, too, like...
Don't sweat it, you guys.</font>

68
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, with any luck at all,
we won't be spending any time</font>

69
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">here, so just think of
it more like a locker.</font>

70
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:22,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

71
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, is no one gonna
talk about Dee's hair?</font>

72
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:26,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I was waiting to pounce.</font>

73
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't know
what our cue was.</font>

74
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was waiting for
Dennis to jump on top of it.</font>

75
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we were gonna slay her.</font>

76
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:32,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

77
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:32,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. It's fine.</font>

78
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the cool girls get their
hair braided at the Shore.</font>

79
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she looks like Bo Derek.</font>

80
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:36,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Dennis.</font>

81
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm. You see, Dee and I have some
very fond memories of the Shore.</font>

82
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna have you
sullying those great memories</font>

83
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">with all your goddamn insults.</font>

84
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm.</font>

85
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you drinking sunscreen?</font>

86
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's a decoy.</font>

87
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're drinking tequila out
of sunscreen bottles.</font>

88
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very strict open container
laws here at the Jersey Shore.</font>

89
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers.</font>

90
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

91
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the ocean?</font>

92
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

93
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, buddy, that's the ocean.</font>

94
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's on the other
side of it there?</font>

95
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:03,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Europe.</font>

96
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

97
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how long would it take...?</font>

98
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not try and swim to Europe.</font>

99
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:07,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

100
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't swim to Europe?</font>

101
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not.</font>

102
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a matter of fact, why don't
you stick with Dee and I</font>

103
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we can show you the
ropes here at the Jersey Shore.</font>

104
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody, you
know what time it is!</font>

105
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go strut the beach.</font>

106
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not strutting shit.</font>

107
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">No beach strutting for me.</font>

108
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:22,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna find a place
to relax and unwind.</font>

109
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:23,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I'm with you.</font>

110
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:23,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

111
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you grab
us some booze?</font>

112
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go down to the beach
and get us some prime real</font>

113
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:29,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">estate before those gorilla
dickheads get down there.</font>

114
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Gonna relax.</font>

115
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it!</font>

116
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get out of here.</font>

117
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:38,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, this ocean breeze
feels so good on my scalp.</font>

118
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it feels awesome.</font>

119
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:41,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sand feels good
beneath my feet.</font>

120
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

121
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:44,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little curious as to where
all the people are, though.</font>

122
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:45,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea, no idea.</font>

123
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't want to say anything,
didn't want to ruin the mood,</font>

124
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:48,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">but where are the people?</font>

125
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:50,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm seeing a lot more
dogs than people, right?</font>

126
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a shit-ton of
dogs out here, I tell ya.</font>

127
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are their masters?</font>

128
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think these
dogs have masters.</font>

129
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think these dogs play
by their own rules.</font>

130
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, clearly, the action
has shifted elsewhere.</font>

131
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to go to the boardwalk?</font>

132
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, let's go to the boardwalk!</font>

133
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:02,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

134
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:03,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Hey, Charlie!</font>

135
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:04,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie!</font>

136
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here!</font>

137
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, oh, my God, this
place is amazing!</font>

138
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:09,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

139
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:10,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

140
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:11,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the sun block drink?</font>

141
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice, guys.</font>

142
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're really good.</font>

143
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're really good.</font>

144
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thing is, I didn't make you one.</font>

145
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Jesus Chris, Charlie!</font>

146
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're drinking sun block.</font>

147
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:23,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good. It gets you,
it gets you all.</font>

148
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're ingesting viscous chemicals,
and they're getting you high.</font>

149
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:26,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter.</font>

150
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:26,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter.</font>

151
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're going to the boardwalk.
What do you say?</font>

152
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

153
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:30,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to leave?</font>

154
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:30,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

155
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like we're just scratching the
surface of all the cool shit out here.</font>

156
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">What cool shit?</font>

157
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the sea specimens, the
stray dogs, the trash that</font>

158
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">floated over from Europe.</font>

159
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but we didn't come here to
play with stray dogs and trash, man.</font>

160
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">We came here to soak
up the culture.</font>

161
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the boardwalk is the
cultural center of the Jersey</font>

162
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shore, so let's go there.</font>

163
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man!</font>

164
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all right.</font>

165
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goin' to the boardwalk.</font>

166
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:05,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Mac, you see that sign
there that says "Taxic spill"?</font>

167
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

168
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

169
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:08,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disregard that, Frank.</font>

170
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bunch of
liberal bullshit.</font>

171
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:11,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right.</font>

172
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a nice spot.</font>

173
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. Whoa!</font>

174
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

175
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were supposed to get booze.</font>

176
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:19,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is ham soaked in rum.</font>

177
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is loaded with booze.</font>

178
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it, Frank,
eating your drinks?</font>

179
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is genius!</font>

180
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:26,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

181
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

182
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:30,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the... What the...
What is that?</font>

183
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

184
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got stuck with a needle.</font>

185
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's a syringe.</font>

186
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful. They are everywhere.</font>

187
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beach is full of syringes.</font>

188
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that?</font>

189
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're in the steroid
capital of the world, Frank.</font>

190
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest with you, as a man
who works very hard to maintain</font>

191
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">a certain level of physical excellence,
I find shortcuts insulting.</font>

192
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now give me a piece of ham now.</font>

193
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, check that out.</font>

194
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's a
dog doing here?</font>

195
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, get out of here!</font>

196
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:55,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here!</font>

197
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:56,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here!</font>

198
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn dogs, I'm
telling you, dude.</font>

199
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">The were lurking before,
now they're swarming.</font>

200
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:02,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sharing my
ham with no dogs.</font>

201
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:05,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a great idea.</font>

202
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:12,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, warm sun, cool ocean breezes,
getting rip-shit on ham.</font>

203
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might you say
we're getting "hammered."</font>

204
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:18,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice one.</font>

205
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:19,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a great idea, Frank.</font>

206
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great idea.</font>

207
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is 90-proof ham.</font>

208
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you mutts!</font>

209
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here, you bitch!</font>

210
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:31,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come and get it.</font>

211
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:32,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid dogs.</font>

212
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:34,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We outsmarted those dogs, Frank.</font>

213
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, this is the
boardwalk, man.</font>

214
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is amazing.</font>

215
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's a little bit more desolate
than I was hoping it would be, but...</font>

216
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but that's okay.</font>

217
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still really great.</font>

218
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlie, there's all kinds of rides
and games and opportunities to win</font>

219
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:46,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">stuffed toys.</font>

220
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man, the boardwalk
is a blast, man.</font>

221
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:52,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is under the boardwalk
where the action really happens.</font>

222
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, pal.</font>

223
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?</font>

224
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

225
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:56,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what's down there?</font>

226
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlie, come on.</font>

227
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">So under the boardwalk's
where it's at?</font>

228
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man.</font>

229
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna knock
your socks off.</font>

230
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know who you're going to run
into, what they're gonna be doing.</font>

231
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:06,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love the bridge, right?</font>

232
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:06,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

233
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a lot like being under
the bridge, I would think.</font>

234
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:09,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's way better than that.</font>

235
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under the boardwalk is
a magical place, man.</font>

236
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a special place in my heart
'cause I had my first kiss down here.</font>

237
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:14,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

238
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:14,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you?</font>

239
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude, all kinds of romantic
shit happens... Oh, God!</font>

240
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

241
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

242
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

243
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:25,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! What was that?</font>

244
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two homeless guys
banging each other.</font>

245
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:28,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw, but why?</font>

246
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:29,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not magical.</font>

247
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:30,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not romantic.</font>

248
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your idea of romantic?</font>

249
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:32,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

250
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are other kinds of
romances that happen under here.</font>

251
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:36,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to see
anything else like that.</font>

252
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, I'm out of here.</font>

253
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:37,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you guys are perverted.</font>

254
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:38,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get out of here.</font>

255
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:39,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get out of here.</font>

256
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get out of here, Charlie.</font>

257
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch.</font>

258
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

259
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the beach?</font>

260
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, wake up.</font>

261
00:07:58,383 --> 00:07:59,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What's the matter?</font>

262
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the beach?</font>

263
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't know.</font>

264
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in the middle
of the goddamn ocean!</font>

265
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:08,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are.</font>

266
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we gonna do?</font>

267
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:15,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're going to conk out
for a while and let the current</font>

268
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:17,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">gently roll us back to shore.</font>

269
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, the current is what brought
us out here in the first place.</font>

270
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, we should be paddling
against it to get back to the beach.</font>

271
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to pretend
like I didn't hear that.</font>

272
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Frank, we are no
longer in relaxing mode.</font>

273
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are now in survival mode.</font>

274
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:33,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stop being so dramatic?</font>

275
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

276
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

277
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the rum ham?</font>

278
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the rum...?</font>

279
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

280
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rum ham!</font>

281
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Frank, stay in the boat.</font>

282
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rum ham!</font>

283
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, stay in the boat.</font>

284
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want rum ham!</font>

285
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, rum ham.</font>

286
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, rum ham.</font>

287
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, rum ham.</font>

288
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is going
to be great, right?</font>

289
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:03,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it is.</font>

290
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:08,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing like some good, innocent, wholesome,
above-the-boardwalk fun to, uh,</font>

291
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:09,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">get us back on track.</font>

292
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Take a step back
from the situation.</font>

293
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a clearer perspective.</font>

294
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and then we'll plummet
20 stories and the rush will</font>

295
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:17,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">propel us forward into
an awesome evening.</font>

296
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

297
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:20,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hopefully cleanse us of the horrifying
events that we've just witnessed.</font>

298
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">These beads are really
digging into my back.</font>

299
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wind... I don't know.</font>

300
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:27,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if we should
have come back here.</font>

301
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we made a mistake, because
we have so many memories... Oh, no.</font>

302
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:31,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my hair stuck?</font>

303
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

304
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:33,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels it's... Yeah?</font>

305
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

306
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, get it.</font>

307
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:35,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

308
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it out, because we're about to drop...
Get it!</font>

309
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:39,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stick your hand... You think I'm going
to stick my fingers into the machinery?</font>

310
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, you down there.</font>

311
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not make it go, because my
hair is stuck, and something</font>

312
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:45,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">terrible will happen.</font>

313
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's really in there.</font>

314
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you idiot, stop the ride!</font>

315
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:51,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make it fall!</font>

316
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

317
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:11,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

318
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:12,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you holding up, sis?</font>

319
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not well, Dennis. Not well.</font>

320
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:18,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any id how horrifying it was
to ride that back up to get my hair?</font>

321
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, be thankful
you got it back.</font>

322
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:22,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to get my scalp
sewnack on and get the hell</font>

323
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of this miserable town.</font>

324
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to wonder what
the hell we ever saw in this</font>

325
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:26,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">place, you know what I mean?</font>

326
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look at this girl.</font>

327
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's her story?</font>

328
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a decent
bone structure.</font>

329
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was probably very
pretty when she was young.</font>

330
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:33,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

331
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:37,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably spent her summers here, lounging
on the beach and scooping ice cream.</font>

332
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:40,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she didn't want her summers to end,
so she got herself a fake I.D. and a</font>

333
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">push-up bra and started hanging
out at the local bars.</font>

334
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

335
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Developed a nasty coke habit, 'cause
she loved the way it made her feel.</font>

336
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:46,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

337
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extreme highs gave way to extreme
lows and she fell into a depression.</font>

338
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:51,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had herself a kid.</font>

339
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought it would give
her a sense of purpose.</font>

340
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it did, for a while, until
she started using again.</font>

341
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:56,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

342
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then social services came
knocking at the door, and now</font>

343
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:01,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">the kid lives upstate with his
grandparents, 'cause she can't</font>

344
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">take care of this kid.</font>

345
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:05,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here she is festering away
in a one-bedroom apartment</font>

346
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting for the HIV
to turn into AIDS:</font>

347
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wondering what the hell...
You know I can hear you, right?</font>

348
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:13,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry.</font>

349
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:14,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just using you
as a metaphor, though.</font>

350
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:15,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

351
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't mean
anything personal.</font>

352
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't sweat it.</font>

353
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not that far off.</font>

354
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

355
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, baby.</font>

356
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, are you seeing this?</font>

357
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:26,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

358
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, even the doctors in
this town are drug dealers.</font>

359
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:29,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, wait.</font>

360
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:29,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

361
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

362
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:31,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you come from?</font>

363
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:32,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.</font>

364
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:33,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it.</font>

365
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:33,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Goddamn it!</font>

366
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn you!</font>

367
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this town, Dennis.</font>

368
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:37,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this town.</font>

369
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:39,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, all right,
well calm down.</font>

370
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's understandable.</font>

371
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are missing a
piece of your scalp.</font>

372
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

373
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like you two
could use a break.</font>

374
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to come party with
me and my friends?</font>

375
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yes.</font>

376
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

377
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so thirsty.</font>

378
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:58,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gargle some more water, bitch.</font>

379
00:11:58,412 --> 00:11:59,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been gargling.</font>

380
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't snap at me.</font>

381
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, quit acting so bossy.</font>

382
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what, guy,
we can't fight, all right?</font>

383
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:06,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're both very cranky.</font>

384
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't eaten in
a very long time.</font>

385
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starving.</font>

386
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:12,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right, look, maybe
I'll dive down there, I'll spear</font>

387
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:15,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">a tuna, I'll wrestle him
on board and we'll feast.</font>

388
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom, let's eat.</font>

389
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, give me the knife.</font>

390
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't give you the knife.</font>

391
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:23,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why not?</font>

392
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause there may come a time
when difficult decisions must be</font>

393
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">made, and I'd rather be
the one with the knife.</font>

394
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What difficult decisions?</font>

395
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

396
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:33,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, like things
you do to stay alive.</font>

397
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:38,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you talking about killing
and eating me, Frank?</font>

398
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:40,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I'm saying is, that when you
go into survival mode, it's</font>

399
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:42,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">every man for himself.</font>

400
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem like you're in
survival mode right now.</font>

401
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:49,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I am, maybe
I ain't, rum ham.</font>

402
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just call me rum ham?</font>

403
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Frank, we cannot be
talking about killing and eating</font>

404
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">each other already, okay?</font>

405
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell that to the rum ham.</font>

406
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop talking about
the goddamn rum ham.</font>

407
00:12:58,838 --> 00:12:59,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should have been you!</font>

408
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

409
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus...</font>

410
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

411
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

412
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see what you've done?</font>

413
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:09,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've murdered us both,
you son of a bitch.</font>

414
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, what's that?</font>

415
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:13,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a boat!</font>

416
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:14,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a boat!</font>

417
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're saved!</font>

418
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:18,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that an Italian flag?</font>

419
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Guidos.</font>

420
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:24,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guidos, we're here.</font>

421
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:27,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here.</font>

422
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

423
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

424
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie?</font>

425
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:39,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

426
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, what are
you doing down here?</font>

427
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you follow me all the
way to the Jersey Shore?</font>

428
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, I swear.</font>

429
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just out here...
but that's cool!</font>

430
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe we're...
That's like destiny!</font>

431
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:53,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... What's in your hand?</font>

432
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something stupid I found.</font>

433
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">No big deal.</font>

434
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see it?</font>

435
00:13:57,616 --> 00:14:00,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

436
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

437
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's really beautiful.</font>

438
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what, I mean...
I think that's a pretty rare</font>

439
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:09,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">one, but you can
keep it if you want.</font>

440
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:11,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Charlie.</font>

441
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

442
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:17,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you going to insult
me and walk away?</font>

443
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:19,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, or what's going on here?</font>

444
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:22,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I, um...
I don't, I don't know, you know?</font>

445
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love the beach so much,
and it's so beautiful.</font>

446
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could probably just hang
out here for a little while.</font>

447
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:34,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

448
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:36,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't go under
the boardwalk.</font>

449
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

450
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is Dennis and Dee.</font>

451
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:45,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them they could
roll with us tonight.</font>

452
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, uh, hi.</font>

453
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:50,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're, uh, looking forward
to partying with you all tonight.</font>

454
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,401
