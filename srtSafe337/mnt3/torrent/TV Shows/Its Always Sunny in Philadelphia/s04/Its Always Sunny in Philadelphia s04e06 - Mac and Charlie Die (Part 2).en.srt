00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, just to clarify</font>

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:06,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the parole board once
again, you are claiming that</font>

3
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:11,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">your father threatened to, quote,
"eat the living shit out of you".</font>

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is correct.</font>

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Mr. Kelly, in your sworn
statement to police, you claim</font>

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the prisoner told you that
if you didn't, and I quote,</font>

7
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:28,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">"jam a bunch of stuff into
your butt," he was going to</font>

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">"rape you so hard
the room would stink."</font>

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, he was going to, quote,</font>

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">"eat your butt and his son's butt</font>

11
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:43,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the stink until his
stomach was full of...</font>

12
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">your butts."</font>

13
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this correct?
- That is also correct.</font>

14
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, I'm sorry.</font>

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Warden, they're lying.</font>

16
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:55,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not want to hurt them.</font>

17
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:01,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I want to get as far away
from those two as I possibly can.</font>

18
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:02,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Objection!</font>

19
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an objection, Your Honor.</font>

20
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:04,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, he's lying to you!</font>

21
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:05,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move to strike!</font>

22
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:06,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move to strike!</font>

23
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:08,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet! Sit down. Sit down!</font>

24
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:10,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying!
He is lying!</font>

25
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down... Get your hands
off the microphone.</font>

26
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just leave it in the middle
of the two of you.</font>

27
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:14,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave it alone.</font>

28
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:15,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said the middle, put it in
the middle.</font>

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your hands off the mic!</font>

30
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leave it alone.
- That's not the middle.</font>

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave it there.</font>

32
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:21,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

33
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:26,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few weeks ago, they came to
apologize for getting me arrested.</font>

34
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not accept their apology.</font>

35
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:30,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">That never happened!</font>

36
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:31,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were friends...</font>

37
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! Charlie, shut up!</font>

38
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet! Quiet!</font>

39
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet at the hearing!</font>

40
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,616
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, yeah, Dad?</i></font>

41
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Not going to accept our apology?</i></font>

42
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:39,195

tell those parole board dickheads</i></font>

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,900

my butt until the room stinks,</i></font>

exactly like that...</i></font>

something like that, yeah.</i></font>

52
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,787
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, I think all the butt

some stuff into the stinking bindle.</font>

58
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, no matter where we go,
my dad will find us,</font>

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">and while I admit it would be
awesome to be hobos,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">drifting from town to town,
solving mysteries,</font>

a real solution.</font>

62

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, how do hobos fit
all this stuff into a bandana?</font>

63
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't make sense, man.</font>

64
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to need, like, a towel or
a tablecloth or something, but...</font>

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not going to look cool.</font>

66
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to look like assholes...</font>

67
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second. That's it! I got it!</font>

68
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:04,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it!</font>

69
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget the bindle.</font>

70
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:09,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way that
my dad is not going to kill us,</font>

71
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">is if he thinks we're already dead.</font>

72
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:11,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great.</font>

73
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:12,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping you'd say that.</font>

74
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, let's kill ourselves.</font>

75
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:14,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

76
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, you didn't let
me finish. I don't...</font>

77
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's no problem, dude.</font>

78
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:16,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm totally on board.</font>

79
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm going to grab a knife,
I'm going to jab it into your neck,</font>

80
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll yank it out. Then your blood's
going to start going everywhere.</font>

81
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:22,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, buddy, listen.</font>

82
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll die in five
to ten minutes,</font>

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then depending on
how horrific that looks,</font>

84
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:25,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll probably do it myself, too.</font>

85
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, listen, I was going to
say we fake our own death,</font>

86
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then he thinks we're dead,
and he leaves us alone.</font>

87
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:32,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right.
Either way works, dude.</font>

88
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just pick one
before he gets here.</font>

89
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pick the second one
where we don't actually die.</font>

90
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down!
We'll pick the second one.</font>

91
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:40,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right now, let's think.</font>

92
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to do it in some way
that's convincing, all right.</font>

93
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we were going to kill ourselves,
it'd be awesome, right?</font>

94
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. If we were
going to kill ourselves,</font>

95
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would be with class, right,
I mean, because we're worth it.</font>

96
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it would be with class!</font>

97
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:51,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think, I'm not
going to die with class?</font>

98
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe some type of explosion?</font>

99
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:54,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course there's going
to be an explosion.</font>

100
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm not going to explode?</font>

101
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking, Charlie, it would be some
kind of blaze of glory for you, yes...</font>

102
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it's going to be a
blaze of glory.</font>

103
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:01,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going down right now.</font>

104
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:03,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, okay, hold on
a second, okay, all right, so...</font>

105
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I miss something?</font>

106
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not getting this. I'll walk
you through the steps as we go.</font>

107
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">First step: do not douse
yourself with lighter fluid.</font>

108
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that?
- I don't know.</font>

109
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it's for
watching somebody poop?</font>

110
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:21,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think there's some perv
coming in here to watch me make?</font>

111
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:22,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you
guys doing in here?</font>

112
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to go to the bathroom.</font>

113
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a hole in the wall. We're
just trying to figure out what it is.</font>

114
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:30,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well, Deandra.</font>

115
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:31,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you look at that.</font>

116
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:36,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, Dee, what you two have
discovered today</font>

117
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:41,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">is what is most commonly
referred to... as a glory hole.</font>

118
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:42,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">A glory hole?</font>

119
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">A secret portal created
as a passage way</font>

120
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">for one to safely
insert one's penis.</font>

121
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, a hole
to stick your dick in?</font>

122
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">The partition acts
as a physical barrier,</font>

123
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">thus ensuring anonymity throughout
the spontaneous act of copulation,</font>

124
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">or fellatio, or at
the very least, a hand job.</font>

125
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why?</font>

126
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you want to have sex
with someone you can't see?</font>

127
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Dee, I think
the real question is,</font>

128
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">why wouldn't you want to have
sex with someone you can't see?</font>

129
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very European.</font>

130
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Europe leads the way in sexual
exploration, and quite frankly,</font>

131
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's time we caught up.</font>

132
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">This sounds hot.</font>

133
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go get some duct tape.</font>

134
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hold on
a second there, Frank.</font>

135
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you go sticking anything
through that hole,</font>

136
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">you might want to consider that
on the other side of this wall,</font>

137
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">more often than not,
there's a dude.</font>

138
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't see through the wall,
so how do you know it's not a girl?</font>

139
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I could just picture
a girl, and then, it's good.</font>

140
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, well, some might find
that method effective,</font>

141
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's a dangerous game
you're playing, Frank.</font>

142
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Supposing the other guy is
picturing a girl, also.</font>

143
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's he going to do that
with a dick in his mouth?</font>

144
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. That's his problem.</font>

145
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're filling it in.</font>

146
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, buddy, you ready?</font>

147
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:57,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure we have to do this?</font>

148
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, yes, we have to do this.</font>

149
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if the cops are going to
identify the bodies,</font>

150
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">we need to leave dental
records behind, right?</font>

151
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we leave a couple of teeth,
bing, bam, boom.</font>

152
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I feel like
it's going to hurt.</font>

153
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's going to hurt
like a bitch. Okay, ready?</font>

154
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two...</font>

155
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. That just kind of
came out on its own.</font>

156
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:14,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that slipped right out, huh?</font>

157
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I barely pulled that.
I barely pulled it.</font>

158
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Damn, dude!</font>

159
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:20,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's another...</font>

160
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, you should really brush your
teeth more because that is not normal.</font>

161
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:26,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlie, stop pulling
your teeth out like that, man.</font>

162
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:26,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's freaking me out.</font>

163
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just coming right out.
They, like, slip right out.</font>

164
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really freaking me out!</font>

165
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

166
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think it's my dad?
- Of course it's your dad.</font>

167
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:34,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, open up.</font>

168
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a dick hole in the bar.</font>

169
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to come fill it in.</font>

170
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I got to go fill her
a dick hole, bro.</font>

171
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:40,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, bro, come on.
We don't have time.</font>

172
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, uh, audible.
Grab the camera.</font>

173
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Dee's car outside?</font>

174
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... yes.</font>

175
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great. We'll steal it. We'll
use it as a part of blaze of glory.</font>

176
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie, now you got to stop.</font>

177
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:50,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really got to stop.
Just give it to me.</font>

178
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me all the teeth.
Okay, I got them in my pocket.</font>

179
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Hey! What the...</font>

180
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go, go, go!</font>

181
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you do that?</font>

182
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Open the door!</font>

183
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? I don't know.
It's all happening so fast, man!</font>

184
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could've just opened it.</font>

185
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's true.</font>

186
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fire you through that window.
All right, grab the...</font>

187
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go! Just go! Go, go, go!</font>

188
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">The videotape is done.</font>

189
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">My teeth are scattered
throughout the car,</font>

190
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the will is in place.</font>

191
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.
Toss it out the window.</font>

192
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll think we did it
at the last minute.</font>

193
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, got it.</font>

194
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. What's next?</font>

195
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm going to gun
this car as fast as it goes</font>

196
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">directly into that wall.</font>

197
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, judging by the distance,
I'm thinking I could get it up</font>

198
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">to about 60, 70 miles an hour.</font>

199
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:44,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, definitely, definitely.</font>

200
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the last possible second,</font>

201
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking maybe
three feet from the wall...</font>

202
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:51,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">We jump out to safety, the car
explodes in a hot ball of fury</font>

203
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're dead to the world.</font>

204
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okey dokey.</font>

205
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck with that.</font>

206
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Where you going, dude?</font>

207
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
watch you do it.</font>

208
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we need to do it together.</font>

209
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I'm not really doing anything.
- Yes, you are, Charlie.</font>

210
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here for moral support.</font>

211
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if no one's actually
seeing us jump out of the car...</font>

212
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's... we're gonna
kill ourselves together.</font>

213
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no real...</font>

214
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out, get out, get out.</font>

215
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it myself.</font>

216
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole thing's gonna be
better without me anyway, Mac.</font>

217
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, it's gonna be
great without me.</font>

218
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:14,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, buddy, good luck!</font>

219
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:16,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pussy.</font>

220
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit, dude, are you all
right?</font>

221
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you jump out?</font>

222
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm okay, I'm okay, Charlie.
- Holly shit!</font>

223
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, oh, my God!</font>

224
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I was just going too fast.</font>

225
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going too fast.</font>

226
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

227
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's get out of here.</font>

228
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:40,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have to burn the car.</font>

229
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

230
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:42,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to get some gasoline.</font>

231
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

232
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna find something
to burn the car at a pawnshop.</font>

233
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:54,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?</font>

234
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can find amazing things
in pawnshops.</font>

235
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the perfect...</font>

236
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should've gone to a gas
station, dude,</font>

237
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">and buy some gasoline
to burn the car.</font>

238
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but we've been talking
about this the whole walk over.</font>

239
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:03,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't go to a gas station.</font>

240
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's too many cameras.</font>

241
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, like, I say something,
and then you, like,</font>

242
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">forget it two seconds later, okay?</font>

243
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you're all right?</font>

244
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:10,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ear's bleeding a ton.</font>

245
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.</font>

246
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:12,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like $1 million.</font>

247
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well,
you don't seem like...</font>

248
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:16,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, focus,
Mr. Million Dollars,</font>

249
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let's find something
to blow up a car.</font>

250
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlie!</font>

251
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that wedding dress, dude.</font>

252
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's sad.</font>

253
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:26,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that is not gonna blow
a car up, okay?</font>

254
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, can you focus?</font>

255
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please find a way to
focus?</font>

256
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, look at this, dude!</font>

257
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're talking.</font>

258
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, they sell guns here?</font>

259
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:37,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sell everything here.</font>

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what
I'm trying to tell you.</font>

261
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pawnshops are like
international waters.</font>

262
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">People come in, and they just
trade stuff, you know what I mean?</font>

263
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything goes here.</font>

264
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get whatever
we want, all right?</font>

265
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:47,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pick this bad boy up.</font>

266
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, that's awesome.
All right, good.</font>

267
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're sure we'll have enough money
for this and the wedding dress, right?</font>

268
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause that is a great gun.</font>

269
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not buying
the wedding dress.</font>

270
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're buying
the wedding dress.</font>

271
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:58,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you crazy?</font>

272
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just leave it here.</font>

273
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:00,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">We absolutely can leave it here.</font>

274
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not gonna help us
in any way, shape or form.</font>

275
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:02,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's crazy.</font>

276
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, okay, you know what?</font>

277
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">That car wreck, it scrambled
your circuits, all right?</font>

278
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:07,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're losing your mind.</font>

279
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, will you just
let me handle it?</font>

280
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:09,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Dee's purse.</font>

281
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:10,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got her credit cards in here.</font>

282
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:11,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have plenty of money.</font>

283
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:12,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what I'm doing.</font>

284
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And stop talking about
the wedding dress.</font>

285
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

286
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:17,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, excuse me, sir.</font>

287
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:23,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, we are in desperate need
of something that will destroy</font>

288
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">a car and, uh, annihilate any
traces of a human being.</font>

289
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:29,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see what I got.</font>

290
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:31,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you see that?</font>

291
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your old buddy here knows
what he's doing every now and then.</font>

292
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

293
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:43,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is an interesting turn.</font>

294
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assuming this is
a live grenade, yes?</font>

295
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

296
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, we'll take it.</font>

297
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was the wedding in Philadelphia?</font>

298
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

299
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about the wedding.</font>

300
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, do you have anything that
might get my buddy's head straight?</font>

301
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's losing his mind.</font>

302
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got some poppers in the back.</font>

303
00:10:59,326 --> 00:10:59,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

304
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:01,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

305
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Luther, today's the day.</font>

306
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got any plans for the outside?</font>

307
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got some plans.</font>

308
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got some big plans.</font>

309
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna throw
this grenade into the car.</font>

310
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car will explode, and
our problems will be solved.</font>

311
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:35,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,
I need you to do a popper.</font>

312
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I understand the plan.</font>

313
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for when we find the bride.</font>

314
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even start, man.</font>

315
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:42,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a very important part
- You've been talking crazy</font>

316
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- of my plan.
- for way too long,</font>

317
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">so just take
a deep breath of this.</font>

318
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inhale.</font>

319
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

320
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:50,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grenade.</font>

321
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna throw it in the car.</font>

322
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, let's do it.
- You and me?</font>

323
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:53,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm back.</font>

324
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not talk about
the dress anymore.</font>

325
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:55,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, here we go.</font>

326
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:56,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">No dress, grenade.</font>

327
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:58,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, move!</font>

328
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go, go!</font>

329
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:02,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be awesome,
dude.</font>

330
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:03,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be huge.</font>

331
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:11,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?</font>

332
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:11,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird.</font>

333
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was totally lame.
- That's what grenades do?</font>

334
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was a very old grenade.
- What a gyp.</font>

335
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was gonna be so
much more awesome than that.</font>

336
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:19,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car's not even on fire.</font>

337
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:20,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, plan B.</font>

338
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gun, gas tank.</font>

339
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:23,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna fire directly into it.</font>

340
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The car's gonna go up.
- Now you're thinking.</font>

341
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:25,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Go, baby.</font>

342
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

343
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna waste all the
bullets.</font>

344
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to get a lot closer.</font>

345
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:33,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Closer?</font>

346
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you got to stay far away
cause it's gonna blow up, dude.</font>

347
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chickenshit, I'll walk right
up to that thing and shoot.</font>

348
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:39,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't walk right up
to it and shoot.</font>

349
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:40,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll blow you to safety.</font>

350
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, how about this?</font>

351
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Popper... put it to my nose.</font>

352
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll walk up, and I'll just be...
- That will help you focus.</font>

353
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:48,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, let's just...</font>

354
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's at least
the smart thing to do.</font>

355
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, hold on, I'm stepping on
this dress.</font>

356
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two...</font>

357
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:54,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

358
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah, God damn it, dude!
- No more bullets.</font>

359
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grenades and bullets
don't burn cars?</font>

360
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, dude, new plan.</font>

361
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The teeth, the envelope, the crash.
I think it's enough, you know?</font>

362
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's enough?</font>

363
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the cops will think
we just, like, I don't know...</font>

364
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:09,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">disintegrated?</font>

365
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, fine.</font>

366
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:12,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, we'll get these credit cards,
we'll buy some camping equipment.</font>

367
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go up to the roof,
and we'll lay low.</font>

368
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, there's my boy.
He's making plans again.</font>

369
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:16,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's thinking.
- He's back!</font>

370
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's also wearing a wedding dress,
though, and I'd like him to take it off.</font>

371
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, this is outrageous.</font>

372
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's completely crazy, man.</font>

373
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it.</font>

374
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'm starting to have
second thoughts about</font>

375
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:31,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">this sex party thing, Frank.</font>

376
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, what, are you having
second thoughts about the glory hole?</font>

377
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you're gonna be skittish
about the sex party?</font>

378
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't...</font>

379
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you wanted
to have anonymous sex.</font>

380
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the place.</font>

381
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do want to have anonymous sex.
I want to have anonymous sex.</font>

382
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to have a sex party.
I want it all.</font>

383
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:46,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the glory hole.
I want all those things.</font>

384
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is.</font>

385
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I'm having a hard time
believing, though, Frank,</font>

386
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:52,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that there is an elite secret
sex society behind that door,</font>

387
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this building.</font>

388
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to run with this crew.</font>

389
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:57,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people are the most
powerful, influential,</font>

390
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">sexiest people in Philadelphia.</font>

391
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, why are they having
a goddamn orgy in such a dump then?</font>

392
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought this kind of thing went down
in, like, somebody's elegant mansion.</font>

393
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was looking forward to that.</font>

394
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:08,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, nobody's gonna have
an orgy in their mansion.</font>

395
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">All over their nice furniture?
I mean, that doesn't make sense.</font>

396
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no, it doesn't.
That's a really good point.</font>

397
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:14,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's do it.</font>

398
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all right, put your mask on,
and don't embarrass me.</font>

399
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Don't embarrass yourself.</font>

400
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:28,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the password?</font>

401
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orgy...</font>

402
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may enter.</font>

403
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:42,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orgy?
Seriously?</font>

404
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:52,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this place?
What did you bring me to?</font>

405
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a buffet.</font>

406
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can see that it's a
buffet, but why is there a buffet</font>

407
00:14:55,587 --> 00:14:57,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a goddamn orgy, Frank?</font>

408
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:59,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to bang on
an empty stomach, do you?</font>

409
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to bang any of
these people anyway.</font>

410
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all paunchy
and weird and old.</font>

411
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell under the masks.</font>

412
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:05,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can absolutely tell.</font>

413
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why are our costumes so much
more elaborate than everybody</font>

414
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">else's like they didn't put
any effort into it?</font>

415
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Jesus Christ, that guy's
not even wearing a mask.</font>

416
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got the right idea.</font>

417
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">This beak is interfering
with my nosh.</font>

418
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Don't take it off.</font>

419
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Jesus,
what are we doing here, man?</font>

420
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is this even an orgy?
Nobody's having sex.</font>

421
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:23,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you bring me to?</font>

422
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought me...
what is this, like...</font>

423
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a half nude buffet party.</font>

424
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's not exactly what I thought
it was gonna be, either, but it's okay.</font>

425
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:30,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of food.</font>

426
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I think we can both
agree this is not the kind of</font>

427
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:34,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">anonymous sex that
we're looking for, right?</font>

428
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to go down by the bridge?</font>

429
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in God's name could
possibly be down by the bridge?</font>

430
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
It could be cool.</font>

431
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be cool?</font>

432
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Frank, I don't want to go
down by the bridge.</font>

433
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what,
I'm going back to the bar.</font>

434
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:46,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go back
to the glory hole.</font>

435
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's something that I feel like
I could wrap my head around.</font>

436
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:49,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous.</font>

437
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think these are fresh
shrimp or frozen shrimp?</font>

438
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care!</font>

439
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?
These are not...</font>

440
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these people?</font>

441
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a bad acid trip in here.</font>

442
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming.
I'm gonna come.</font>

443
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what if I just slip my
foot over like this, as if to say,</font>

444
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hello, I'd like to have
some anonymous sex please."</font>

445
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:14,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm into that.</font>

446
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, I wait for the signal back.</font>

447
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:20,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's a lady's foot,
I'm in the clear!</font>

448
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Frank, here's
my problem with that.</font>

449
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:22,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man can wear a woman's shoe.</font>

450
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't rule out trickery.</font>

451
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean that's why we need
the viewing slot.</font>

452
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">The slot defeats the purpose.</font>

453
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could see your eyes.
We might as well get married!</font>

454
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the safest way, Frank.</font>

455
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, if I was looking for safe,</font>

456
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be sticking
my dick through a wall.</font>

457
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:39,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, get out here right now.</font>

458
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to take a look at this.</font>

459
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news, Dee, we made
the bathroom unisex.</font>

460
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:45,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glory hole's up and running, baby.</font>

461
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about that.</font>

462
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to
the Philadelphia Police Department,</font>

463
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac and Charlie are dead.</font>

464
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got the camera, man?</font>

465
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:54,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, is it ready?
- Yeah I think so.</font>

466
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:55,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">We good, are we on?</font>

467
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis and Frank, if you're watching
this, then we're already dead.</font>

468
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:00,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our lives were horrible.</font>

469
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horrible and sad,
so we decided to end it all.</font>

470
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me actually, my life
was pretty sweet.</font>

471
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Charlie and I had a suicide pact,
and I have to honor that</font>

472
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I am honorable man.</font>

473
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will die an honorable man.</font>

474
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's also a will enclosed and
you totally have to do all of that</font>

475
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">because that's like a law.</font>

476
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, wait a second.
My life was also very honorable.</font>

477
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go!</font>

478
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe they're dead.</font>

479
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe they didn't
include me in their suicide pact.</font>

480
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:30,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

481
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you crazy?</font>

482
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not dead, they're
definitely doing something stupid,</font>

483
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but they're not dead.
- You saw the tape, Dee!</font>

484
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">My best friends
went on a blaze of glory</font>

485
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they didn't even ask me
to be part of it.</font>

486
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is terrible!</font>

487
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:41,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you buying this?</font>

488
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is ridiculous, Dennis,
they left us a list of demands.</font>

489
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:46,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

490
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's their last will and
testament. That is not demands.</font>

491
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says at the top :
"List of demands."</font>

492
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whatever, it's their wishes
and we have to honor them.</font>

493
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we do? Oh we do,
we have to honor them?</font>

494
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's see, Frank.</font>

495
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:02,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie's number one : my ashes
are to be made into a tea and</font>

496
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:04,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be dranken by everyone in bar.</font>

497
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:05,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done!</font>

498
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, gross, fine, what else?</font>

499
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac's number one.</font>

500
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">In lieu of a body, which was
most likely blown up</font>

501
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the most awesome way imaginable,
I would like the duster to be burned</font>

502
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">and its ashes buried in an unmarked
grave somewhere by the river.</font>

503
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:18,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's crazy.</font>

504
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:21,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna burn
or bury the duster.</font>

505
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we also both have to name
our first born child Murphy</font>

506
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">because that was Robocop's name.</font>

507
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

508
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac is dead and
he's still bossing me around.</font>

509
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mac is not dead, Dennis.</font>

510
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you be so cold?</font>

511
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">They blew up my car!</font>

512
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not burning the duster.</font>

513
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're still talking about a coat?
- Absolutely!</font>

514
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is an automobile.</font>

515
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- It's a piece of clothing!
- They're people!</i></font>

516
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,929
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- They're all lying!
- They're lying people!</i></font>

517
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, man, they must be
really broken up.</font>

518
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can hear 'em from up here.</font>

519
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:47,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like crying
and whing and...</font>

520
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:49,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm excited about the hot dogs.</font>

521
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, crap!
- What?</font>

522
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should've got beans, dude.</font>

523
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:54,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hobos are always eating beans.</font>

524
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:55,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

525
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:56,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be fine without
the beans, all right,</font>

526
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">cause this is a perfect,
perfect hiding spot.</font>

527
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would be better
with beans though.</font>

528
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:02,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave it alone with the beans.</font>

529
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Stop it! Don't do it.</font>

530
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:07,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

531
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">How? How is that possible?</font>

532
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:10,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

533
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just put it down.</font>

534
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think they're my baby teeth?</font>

535
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:14,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it with the other ones.</font>

536
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:18,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna be able to
eat this hot dog.</font>

537
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:19,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll suck it down.</font>

538
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,654
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I asked you to leave me be.</i></font>

539
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:31,456
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I asked you to let me live my life.</i></font>

540
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,679
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But you wouldn't go away.</i></font>

541
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,071
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You kept pushing, and pushing,</i></font>

542
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:44,342
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>until you forced me
to do something drastic...</i></font>

543
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:50,155
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Something I was hoping
I would never have to do...</i></font>

544
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess this is probably,
this is probably gonna be it</font>

545
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we should,
we should get started.</font>

546
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">What to say about Mac.</font>

547
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He certainly was...</font>

548
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:16,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">angry.</font>

549
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Burn the duster!
- I'm not burning the duster!</font>

550
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:20,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm not burning the duster.</font>

551
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that's crazy.
That's like, that's insane.</font>

552
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I ever burn,
I mean, come on.</font>

553
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:28,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will continue to wear it,
in his honor.</font>

554
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will burn some other things.
You know maybe like these,</font>

555
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">stupid goddamn sleeveless t-shirts</font>

556
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:35,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he wants retired
and hung up in the bar.</font>

557
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll burn these. But I am not
burning the duster, okay?</font>

558
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:40,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">So forget it. It probably
won't even burn anyway.</font>

559
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not supposed to...
it's flame-retardant.</font>

560
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:43,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like the whole point.</font>

561
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a shield of armor, so stop
asking me to burn the duster.</font>

562
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna burn it!</font>

563
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:56,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, end of story, you know.
Let's just move on.</font>

564
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

565
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all right.</font>

566
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, thank you.</font>

567
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:14,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

568
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:15,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

569
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not doing it.
- Come on.</font>

570
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:20,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deandra, get on that stage.</font>

571
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:26,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before, uh, Mac and Charlie died
they made a slideshow.</font>

572
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:30,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, we're going to play
a song that was a favorite of theirs.</font>

573
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:31,651

<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bullshit, dude.</font>

586
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's mourning me properly.</font>

587
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about, man?
Your mom's sitting right there.</font>

588
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's mourning you.</font>

589
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:23,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she watched an entire episode
of Mama's Familyand fell asleep.</font>

590
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:26,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, I'm going to give
them the one gun salute.</font>

591
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not!</font>

592
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Oh, my God!
Let go!</font>

593
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that was great
and very touching.</font>

594
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:36,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks so much for coming,
both of you.</font>

595
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:38,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to go.</font>

596
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:40,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at the next one.</font>

597
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:44,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie, aww,
it's going to be okay.</font>

598
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what, why don't
you go into the bathroom,</font>

599
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:50,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">go into the center stall,
I got a little surprise for you.</font>

600
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to cheer you up.</font>

601
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay, Frankie.
I don't need to go potty.</font>

602
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, damn it.</font>

603
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:05,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe it, sis?
They're actually gone.</font>

604
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This changes everything.
- I need a ride home.</font>

605
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
Can't do that, sis.</font>

606
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to get back home ASAP and
meet a couple potential new roommates.</font>

607
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot ones!
You know what I'm saying?</font>

608
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:17,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, hey,
it's time to move on.</font>

609
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:34,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind not breathing
directly into my mouth?</font>

610
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">No thoughts on that?</font>

611
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going to say anything?
You're just going to stare at me?</font>

612
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you're bringing
to the table? That's great.</font>

613
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna... could you excuse me?</font>

614
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:50,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

615
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir... Goddamn.</font>

616
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, I'm just gonna...</font>

617
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:00,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

618
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course, let me do it.</font>

619
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:07,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

620
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

621
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, freak show back there.</font>

622
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, I'm going to need for you
to step behind the line.</font>

623
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:19,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look, as you can probably tell,
I'm not really a bus person.</font>

624
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:22,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, a couple of dicks
destroyed my car and then forced me</font>

625
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:25,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">to lower myself to this, so if you could
just cut me some slack, because...</font>

626
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you've been
back there, but animals.</font>

627
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're touching me. That doesn't...
this isn't weird for you?</font>

628
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:33,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, either you get behind
the line or your ride ends here.</font>

629
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm behind the line.
- You're on the line.</font>

630
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the line, behind the line,
who cares?</font>

631
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.
I'm pulling the bus over.</font>

632
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:42,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, goddamn it, don't pull
the bus over, all right?</font>

633
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

634
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine, you know what?</font>

635
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will go back behind the line with
the rest of the filthy degenerates.</font>

636
00:24:48,273 --> 00:24:49,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I am not happy about it, lady.</font>

637
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me!</font>

638
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my... really?</font>

639
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

640
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, you stay put. I'll get it.</font>

641
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the floor of a bus...</font>

642
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the floor of a filthy bus.</font>

643
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me for just a sec!</font>

644
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:03,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, dude.</font>

645
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe Dee finally caught on
and cancelled her credit cards.</font>

646
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really not good, dude.
Now we don't have any beans.</font>

647
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have any beer, dude.
We're shit out of luck, bro.</font>

648
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:11,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to the bar.</font>

649
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:13,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get some beer there,
at least we'll have that.</font>

650
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a bad idea.</font>

651
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,
I need a popper, all right.</font>

652
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to get my head straight.</font>

653
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:18,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a little bad news
on the popper front.</font>

654
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:20,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the last one, dude.
- Shit! Really?</font>

655
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well,
I think I should get it.</font>

656
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not going to have it.
- Can I just have it?</font>

657
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bro?
- Can I just have it?</font>

658
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:30,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will you let me do the poppers?
- I just want it.</font>

659
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just need it, dude.
- The poppers person.</font>

660
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the popper, dude!
I need that popper, bro!</font>

661
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to have the popper!</font>

662
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:45,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you son of a bitches!</font>

663
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look out.
Look out!</font>

664
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:51,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you jerks!</font>

665
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

666
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! No, stop the bus!
Stop the bus!</font>

667
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:58,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up!</font>

668
00:25:58,304 --> 00:25:59,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shut up, bitch!</font>

669
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the bus!</font>

670
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir? Sir, I just... I need to pull
the cord to get off the bus.</font>

671
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my stop.
You're in my way.</font>

672
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you get out of the way
so I can pull the cord?</font>

673
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get out of your way as soon
as I get off...</font>

674
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, what is
wrong with you?</font>

675
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it, you bitches!</font>

676
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, Mac's shit.</font>

677
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, Mac's shit.
Good-bye, Mac's shit.</font>

678
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye... come on, dude.</font>

679
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">When were you ever going to use
nunchakus? Are you kidding me?</font>

680
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, hang on one second.</font>

681
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:52,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's perfect.</font>

682
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:54,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

683
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hi.
Um, can I help you?</font>

684
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're
looking for a roommate, right?</font>

685
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:03,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was looking
for two, actually. Female.</font>

686
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:06,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe I was pretty clear
in the ad here.</font>

687
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:09,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Male, 30, looking for
Three's Company type deal.</font>

688
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Odd Couplething for past decade,
looking for something new."</font>

689
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:13,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I did the Three's
Company thing once.</font>

690
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:17,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was pretty cool for like a week,
and then I banged one of them.</font>

691
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh... nice.
- Not nice.</font>

692
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what this is like?
Banging the chicks that you live with?</font>

693
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:23,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's terrible, man.</font>

694
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:25,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day you have to deal
with this.</font>

695
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:28,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out, lady.</font>

696
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:32,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, yeah, I guess I never
really thought about that before.</font>

697
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:35,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you're... you're much
smarter than my old roommate.</font>

698
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look, I'm going to be
upfront with you.</font>

699
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:40,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I run with a pretty wild crew.</font>

700
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:44,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's probably going to be chicks
over here, like, all the time.</font>

701
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm into some pretty crazy shit.</font>

702
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:50,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the best part: I don't
even know most of their names.</font>

703
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes! It's like...</font>

704
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've been trying to get
into the anonymous sex thing lately.</font>

705
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah?
- Now, are you, uh, European?</font>

706
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry.
What gave it away?</font>

707
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:08,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. Yeah, well, you know,
I could probably consider, like,</font>

708
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">a, uh, Perfect Strangers type
of deal.</font>

709
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:14,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I like this by the way.
This is a sweet duster.</font>

710
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, he doesn't burn the duster, and
now he's looking for new roommates?</font>

711
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you want to burn that
duster anyway?</font>

712
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he always wears it with
no shirt and a shitload of cologne.</font>

713
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:30,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's totally ruined.</font>

714
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, bitches!
- Jesus Christ, Dee!</font>

715
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">You scared the shit out of me.
I almost dropped all my beer.</font>

716
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you two weren't dead.</font>

717
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing popping
out of our tent? Not cool, Dee!</font>

718
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:41,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, not cool? Oh, I'll tell you
what's not cool.</font>

719
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:45,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crashing my car into a building,
exploding a grenade inside of it</font>

720
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then convincing your friends
your family that you're dead.</font>

721
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of the cooler
things you could ever do.</font>

722
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's really unbelievably
cool.</font>

723
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I suggest you try it...
- Cooler than I thought it was.</font>

724
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:55,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why
you're up here doing</font>

725
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever it is that you're doing,
and I don't care.</font>

726
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:59,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I do care about,
is my 1997 Dodge Neon.</font>

727
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:00,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here's the deal.</font>

728
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:04,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two monkeys are going to get
me a new 1997 Dodge Neon,</font>

729
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:07,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'm going to go and tell Frank and
Dennis that you faked your own deaths</font>

730
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're hiding up on the roof.</font>

731
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:13,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you're just talking crazy.
You can't buy a new 1997 Dodge Neon.</font>

732
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:15,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can buy an old one...
- Okay, new to me.</font>

733
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you got bigger problems,
because my dad just got out of jail,</font>

734
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:19,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's coming to kill you.</font>

735
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Me?</font>

736
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:22,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

737
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill you, kill us,
kill everybody really.</font>

738
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:25,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to kill everyone.</font>

739
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you not tell me
this news earlier?</font>

740
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, get off our case,
Dee, all right? What's done is done.</font>

741
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Mac and I are hobo
drifters now, okay?</font>

742
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't dwell on the past.</font>

743
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:35,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, hobo drifters
live in the present.</font>

744
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:37,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">So look, if you really want
to get back at Frank and Dennis,</font>

745
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got to fake your own death.</font>

746
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to get back
at Frank and Dennis.</font>

747
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to get at you two.</font>

748
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:43,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really is that what...?</font>

749
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Is that what
your plan was?</font>

750
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tuned out during
the whole tirade.</font>

751
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:49,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said the 1997 Dodge Neon
thing and I totally lost her.</font>

752
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:51,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Dee, I'll tell you
what, here's the plan.</font>

753
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:53,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you fake your own
death like us?</font>

754
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really is the only thing you can do
now 'cause you're in this too deep.</font>

755
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:57,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you want to die?</font>

756
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now... what's your bean situation?</font>

757
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got some beans on you,
or what's up?</font>

758
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:16,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, son.</font>

759
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man, I got to tell you,
this is awesome.</font>

760
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:36,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's making me forget
that Mac ever even died.</font>

761
00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:37,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, just relax,
roommate.</font>

762
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to relax.</font>

763
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:41,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to relax all over
the place in a second.</font>

764
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit. Jan?</font>

765
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:47,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I got to get this.</font>

766
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dennis.</font>

767
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? What do you want?</font>

768
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I just wanted to let you
know I was going to go for</font>

769
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">a quick jog in Fairmont Park
by myself.</font>

770
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah? Great.
Okay, have fun.</font>

771
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, it's kind of dangerous.</font>

772
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:58,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got it, Dee.</font>

773
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know if you noticed...
- Go jogging! Ang go!</font>

774
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:01,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this have to do with me?</font>

775
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:05,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just me out there in the middle of
the night in the dark by myself. Really?</font>

776
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about her, I...</font>

777
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a bag... I hate her.</font>

778
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:15,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one do you want first?
Huh, Greta or Sasha?</font>

779
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. No, shit, bro.
Why'd you do that, bro?</font>

780
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here, man.</font>

781
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did I do?
- You said their names.</font>

782
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:22,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man,
that kills it for me.</font>

783
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, bro,
can I be honest with you?</font>

784
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is great and all, but I was
really hoping for more of like a,</font>

785
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:31,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, anything goes, crazy
European sex party kind of a thing.</font>

786
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Something a little kinkier.
- Kinky?</font>

787
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, kinky. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I like this.</font>

788
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like this, we like this.</font>

789
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let me make some calls.</font>

790
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:43,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you could put
something like that together?</font>

791
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I can, man.
I'm European.</font>

792
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:48,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! That's...</font>

793
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like he's got
a lot of new friends.</font>

794
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I can see that, Charlie.</font>

795
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:57,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of them
are really pretty girls.</font>

796
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:58,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they are very pretty.</font>

797
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that's tough, man.
That's a tough thing to see.</font>

798
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:02,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, dude.</font>

799
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:04,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you Frank
is throwing a party, too.</font>

800
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:08,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your turn to take
the bedpan out tonight.</font>

801
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:11,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Little freak!
I did it last time!"</font>

802
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Charlie, I got up in
the middle of the night,</font>

803
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I walked down
the hallway with the bedpan.</font>

804
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:22,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">"All right, Frank, I'll do it,
only because I like you so much".</font>

805
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:29,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you, too, Charlie.
I like you, too, New Charlie.</font>

806
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, man?
I'm kicking it up a notch.</font>

807
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're haunting these bitches.
- Haunting's cool, man.</font>

808
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Coming back from the grave, bitch.
- All right, that's cool.</font>

809
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:44,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this? What are you doing,
like Poltergeistor something?</font>

810
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Awesome, right?
- No, no.</font>

811
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig T. Nelson.</font>

812
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig T. Nelson is the best,
dude, but Poltergeist?</font>

813
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- It's not scary.</font>

814
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all about psychological damage.</font>

815
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big deal, look at me.</font>

816
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psychological damage up to here.</font>

817
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't do anything for me,
you know?</font>

818
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:00,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Physical damage, that's what's
gonna irritate people.</font>

819
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what do you
suggest?</font>

820
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, if anything, maybe
we tie some knives to our fingers</font>

821
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we get a little more serious
about this whole murder thing.</font>

822
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Haunting.
- Haunting!</font>

823
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're gonna haunt them.
- I'm sorry, I was thinking...</font>

824
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, I'm so happy to
see you.</font>

825
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I had the weirdest night.
It was crazy.</font>

826
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as I left Dennis's place,
I realized I don't have a car,</font>

827
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">right, so I actually do
have to run home by myself</font>

828
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">through the park in the middle
of the night.</font>

829
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:22,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm on Spring Garden Street,
and this big car full of gangbangers...</font>

830
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, gangbangers.
That is an awesome story, Dee.</font>

831
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the end of it, right?
That could be the end of the story?</font>

832
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie and I are right in
the middle of something.</font>

833
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:29,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out, we're gonna
put some knives on our fingers</font>

834
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">and start murdering people.</font>

835
00:33:30,764 --> 00:33:31,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Haunting people.
- Haunting.</font>

836
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're gonna haunt people.
- Whatever.</font>

837
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna do like a
Poltergeistthing?</font>

838
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:36,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's Dennis.
- That's Dennis.</font>

839
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, ladies, like I said,
pop them off.</font>

840
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start popping them off.</font>

841
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love it, I love it.
Hey, feel free to be free.</font>

842
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">No American judgments here. The only
rule is: don't tell me your names.</font>

843
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to know your names,
okay?</font>

844
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hi, I'm Charlie.
Frankie, I love these girls."</font>

845
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:02,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, what are you doing, man?</font>

846
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:04,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're freaking the girls out
with this mannequin. Get rid of it.</font>

847
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:09,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, these girls are German.
German.</font>

848
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:12,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We're gonna have demented sex,
right, Frank?"</font>

849
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the greatest party
I've ever seen. These sons of bitches!</font>

850
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he gonna take that stupid
little mannequin everywhere, man?</font>

851
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:22,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That is freaking me out.
- Move past the mannequin.</font>

852
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just hanging out with
a bunch of half naked ladies,</font>

853
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:26,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just ran and sweated for
absolutely nothing?</font>

854
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't sound like
that, all right.</font>

855
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:29,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Goddamn it. Get past it.
- Who cares about the mannequin?</font>

856
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:30,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care about the mannequin!</font>

857
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look like a jerk
in front of those girls.</font>

858
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:33,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm putting an end to this right
now.</font>

859
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:35,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, dude, screw your dad.
Let him eat our asses.</font>

860
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:37,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him eat my butt
into smithereens.</font>

861
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ending this.</font>

862
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:42,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not be rash, right?
I mean, come on.</font>

863
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if we're not gonna haunt them,
we should have a little fun, right?</font>

864
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:46,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's scare the shit out of
them.</font>

865
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:50,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We got to make an entrance.
- Oh, let's scare the shit out of them.</font>

866
00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:02,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jan, this is what I want, man.
You've given me what I want.</font>

867
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:07,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I have this very kinky
surprise for you, my friend.</font>

868
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:11,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've arranged for you to use
the glory hole!</font>

869
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot about the glory hole.</font>

870
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:17,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just sent someone in there now.
- Yeah?</font>

871
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally anonymous.</font>

872
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no words, man.</font>

873
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:29,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, I'm the boss.</font>

874
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:33,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm a good boss, and
I'm gonna allow you to watch.</font>

875
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:37,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Okay, Frankie!"
Somebody's coming.</font>

876
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:44,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any minute now, the German broad
is gonna knock on that wall,</font>

877
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:49,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is my signal to go in my
pants, take out my penis</font>

878
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stick it through the hole.</font>

879
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, she can go to town.</font>

880
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, honey, you want to take
care of this monster for me or what?</font>

881
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no way I can picture
that is a girl.</font>

882
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you doing here, man?</font>

883
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jan sent me.
- Jan sent me, too.</font>

884
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:09,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bad.</font>

885
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody out!</font>

886
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, there has been
a major miscommunication.</font>

887
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:19,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your European, sex-freaky
asses out of the bar.</font>

888
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, come on.
Come on, move it.</font>

889
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it, that's right.
Go, go, go!</font>

890
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:23,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!</font>

891
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:24,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, ladies.
Let's go, let's go.</font>

892
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out, get out,
get out, get out.</font>

893
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, you too, Jan.
- Hey, beat it.</font>

894
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did I do?
- What did you do?</font>

895
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jan, you were gonna have him
"glory hole" me.</font>

896
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah, my ass. Get out of here.</font>

897
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sex freak, go!</font>

898
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:38,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Americans are so uptight.</font>

899
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ruined our glory hole.
Beat it and shut the door.</font>

900
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:42,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sick freak.</font>

901
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:43,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't know anything...</font>

902
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weirdo.
What?</font>

903
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise, bitches!</font>

904
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're alive, and it's blowing
your minds right now.</font>

905
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it is not blowing
our minds at all.</font>

906
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you guys were alive.</font>

907
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I knew you guys were
alive, okay?</font>

908
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured it out right before
the funeral.</font>

909
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:04,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

910
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I could hear you guys
rustling around in the vents.</font>

911
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were speaking at full
volume, okay?</font>

912
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think you were being,
like, crafty?</font>

913
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could see you staring at me
through the window.</font>

914
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:13,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I can see through
my windows, right?</font>

915
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wanted to piss you off.
- Well, what about me?</font>

916
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:16,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you want to piss me off?</font>

917
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, I thought, might
have actually been murdered.</font>

918
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:21,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I thought.
That's what I thought, okay?</font>

919
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:22,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you knew, too?</font>

920
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... I knew.</font>

921
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:31,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some of the stuff you've been doing
with this mannequin here, that's like...</font>

922
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">to teach me a lesson or...?</font>

923
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:41,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I see you bang that thing?</font>

924
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you know what,
let's just...</font>

925
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why were you guys pretending
that you were dead anyway?</font>

926
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a really messed
up thing to do.</font>

927
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:49,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad got out on parole.
He's coming to kill me and Charlie.</font>

928
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, you got a letter
the other day.</font>

929
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:53,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He sent a letter.
- Who sent a letter?</font>

930
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it, I got it.
It was sent to the bar.</font>

931
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dear son, I asked you
to leave me be...</font>

932
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:03,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">forced me to do something that
I hoped I'd never have to do."</font>

933
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:05,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, here we go.</font>

934
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:08,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I just got out of prison,
and I'm heading to Tijuana.</font>

935
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to get as far away
from you as I could,</font>

936
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:13,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that I could learn
how to forgive you.</font>

937
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please do not try
to contact me ever.</font>

938
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,533

I'm not gonna hurt you.</font>
