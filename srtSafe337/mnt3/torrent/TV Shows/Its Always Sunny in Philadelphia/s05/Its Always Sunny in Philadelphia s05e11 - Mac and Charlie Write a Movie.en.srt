1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now keep in mind,</font>

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've been locked in this parking garage
stairwell for, like, 20 minutes, dude.</font>

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so then we turn
around, and what do we see?</font>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">A scary homeless dude. And I'm, like, "Oh, shit!
" Yeah! And I'm like, uh...</font>

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know- I'm like, "What do we-
What do we do?" You know?</font>

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Mac, he's just like, "Just chill.
" And I'm like, "How do we chill, dude?"</font>

7
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And I'm all, "Oh, shit!
He's gonna talk now!"</font>

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And I'm all like, "How do
you know he's gonna talk, bro?"</font>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm like, "Because his mouth is opening.
" And then he did talk.</font>

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And then he goes- he goes, "I'll
let you out of the stairwell...</font>

11
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I have the key, because
I'm the security guard instead."</font>

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a cool story, huh?
Yeah, right?</font>

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, uh...</font>

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so I'm clear on the story
that you just told. Yeah.</font>

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:46,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was about you guys getting locked in a
garage stairwell for 20 or so minutes.</font>

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And then a security
guard came along...</font>

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the security guard
let you out.</font>

18
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah. But...</font>

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's how you tell the
story that makes it good.</font>

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you told the story
was by far the worst part of the story.</font>

21
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't even
paying attention to us, dude.</font>

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you were doing
was playing on that stupid phone.</font>

23
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you rubbing on the phone?
Let me rub on it.</font>

24
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
No, no, no! Hey, hey, Frank!</font>

25
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your greasy, fat, sausage fingers
of my touch screen phone.</font>

26
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing's new.
My fingers are not greasy.</font>

27
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you have four sausage links
in your pocket right now.</font>

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I don't touch
the sausage links.</font>

29
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I do that when I can
let my shirt do the work? Watch.</font>

30
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. No touching, and warm.
My God. You're an animal.</font>

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what, boners. I just got a part in an M.
Night Shyamalan movie.</font>

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yeah. I'm a featured actress,</font>

33
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means I'm gonna be
featured in a scene.</font>

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's an M. Night?
Wow. Gross.</font>

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">M. Night Shyamalan, the
Indian filmmaker from Philly.</font>

36
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
This dude's a big deal, Frank.</font>

37
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like a true-to-life Slumdog Millionaire.
You know what I mean?</font>

38
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">He always puts some awesome twists at the
end of his movies to trick the audience.</font>

39
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, yeah,
like in The Sixth Sense.</font>

40
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find out that the dude in
that hairpiece the whole time...</font>

41
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's Bruce Willis- the whole movie.
- That's not the twist.</font>

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the twist to that movie.
That wasn't?</font>

43
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I'll tell you about it later.</font>

44
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were a lot of twists in that movie.
Watch it again.</font>

45
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? You're gonna
need a very crafty agent...</font>

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">to squeeze everything
out of this slumdog.</font>

47
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I volunteer.
And I decline.</font>

48
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are abusive
and you smell like warm meat...</font>

49
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I want you to leave me alone 'cause
this is really important for me.</font>

50
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is important
for all of us, okay?</font>

51
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an opportunity for Charlie
and I to get M. Night our script.</font>

52
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Since when do you
and Charlie have a script?</font>

53
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since you walked in here and said you were
in that movie. We're great storytellers.</font>

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, goddamn it! No, come on.
Don't involve yourselves in this.</font>

55
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dee, you involved us in this the second you
walked in and told us about the movie.</font>

56
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really shouldn't have done that.
Let's get to work!</font>

57
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, hoo!</font>

58
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get some beer. Dude.
Yeah!</font>

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

60
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
Can I help you?</font>

61
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great. Nonfat, sugar free,
vanilla soy latte. Three shots, no foam.</font>

62
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, why don't you let me in here
so I can start my vocal warm-ups?</font>

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Who are you again?
Dee Reynolds, featured actress.</font>

64
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reynolds?
Yeah.</font>

65
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">And could you send
M. Night over also,</font>

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I have a couple questions
regarding the detes of my character.</font>

67
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Says you're a featured extra.</font>

68
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, featured extra, featured actress.
What's the difference?</font>

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the difference is...</font>

70
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">a featured actress usually auditions for
the role, has lines, gets a trailer,</font>

71
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">whereas a featured extra is a person
whose head shot we pull off a pile,</font>

72
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">has no lines and sits in that tent
over there till we're ready for her.</font>

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Mmm. Okay.
Ah, ah, ah, ah...</font>

74
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we on
the coffee situation,</font>

75
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's early
and I am hungover.</font>

76
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go sit in the tent. Now.
This tent?</font>

77
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one. Thank you.
Are you sure?</font>

78
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is hard.
Mmm.</font>

79
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, because I want the movie to be big,
you know, and, like, a box office smash...</font>

80
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we want to put, like,
a lot of meat in the seats, you know?</font>

81
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You know what I'm thinking, dude?
You know what I'm thinking?</font>

82
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something that's happening in
Hollywood that's, like, pretty cool.</font>

83
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">They take an underrated actor,
right, whose career is in a slump,</font>

84
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then they make him
a star again.</font>

85
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that is awesome, right?
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.</font>

86
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So, who is the most
underrated actor of all time?</font>

87
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's Dolph Lundgren.
- Correct. Why?</font>

88
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, because of his spiky hair, his
ice-cold demeanor and his big muscles.</font>

89
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely. Okay. All right.
All right, so we have our actor.</font>

90
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. - That's great.
Now we need a really great role for him.</font>

91
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know what I was thinking?
Scientists are cool.</font>

92
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he's a scientist?</font>

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. A muscular scientist.
I'm into that. Right.</font>

94
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as we don't cover up that
body with a lab coat, bro. No, dude.</font>

95
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wearing, like,
a hot mesh tank top.</font>

96
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that. Now does he,
like, fight crime or something?</font>

97
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:45,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fights crime,
uh, with his brain and his brawn.</font>

98
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we be writing this down?
Let's get all this down.</font>

99
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
This is good. All right.</font>

100
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Brains-
Brawn...</font>

101
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brawn-
Muscles...</font>

102
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Dude!
Yeah?</font>

103
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got a Shyamalan twist
to put in this bad boy.</font>

104
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Lay it on me.</font>

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if this scientist
runs around on all fours?</font>

106
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he run on all fours?</font>

107
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a science experiment with a
dog that goes absolutely haywire.</font>

108
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:15,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly he wakes up with the ability
to run around like a hound. You know?</font>

109
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not making the lead of our
big-budget action movie half dog!</font>

110
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not half dog. He's all dog.</font>

111
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are we casting
Dolph Lundgren?</font>

112
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will be the twist.</font>

113
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolph Lundgren will be
the voice of this dog.</font>

114
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a twist!
That's a completely different movie...</font>

115
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a talking-dog scientist
with the voice of Dolph Lundgren!</font>

116
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You know what?
Check this out.</font>

117
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it's a man with a few dog-like qualities,
like, uh, heightened sense of smell...</font>

118
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, Charlie.
We're not- There's no- or licking...</font>

119
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
A heightened sense of smell?</font>

120
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he can smell crime?</font>

121
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he smells crime?</font>

122
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!
Yeah?</font>

123
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he can smell a crime
before it even happens?</font>

124
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit, dude. That's amazing.
Smells crime before it even happens!</font>

125
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, dude!</font>

126
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting somewhere.
What if his entire head is just one big nose?</font>

127
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write that down!
I like that!</font>

128
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's one big nose
on Dolph Lundgren's body.</font>

129
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

130
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho!
What?</font>

131
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no, no, no.
What are you two doing here?</font>

132
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, since you've declined
my offer to be your agent,</font>

133
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've since taken on Dennis
as a client.</font>

134
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis has that
"I don't give a shit" attitude,</font>

135
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is perfect for
Hollywood, right, Dennis?</font>

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I- I really don't care.
See? See?</font>

137
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you want to be
everybody's agent?</font>

138
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's where the money is.
What do you do?</font>

139
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just put things together.
You sit back, you collect 10%...</font>

140
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you let the client
do all the work.</font>

141
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis doesn't give a shit.
Right?</font>

142
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop talking to me.
Perfect.</font>

143
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, you can't just walk in
here and get a part in the movie.</font>

144
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not how it works.</font>

145
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, sir?
Yes?</font>

146
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, could my client have a part
in your movie? Sure. Here.</font>

147
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fill out this form.
You do it.</font>

148
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it.
Unbelievable!</font>

149
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second.
Hey, hey. Assistant, hey.</font>

150
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. When is somebody
gonna tell me what my part is?</font>

151
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name again? Dee Reynolds.
I'm your featured... extra.</font>

152
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. You're a corpse.</font>

153
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">A corpse?
Mm-hmm.</font>

154
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a... zombie roaming through the
streets looking for brains kind of corpse?</font>

155
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Like a dead corpse.
Just a dead corpse?</font>

156
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lifeless body lying in the street.
Okay. All right.</font>

157
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll call you when we're ready for makeup.
I know, but...</font>

158
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second. I have one more-
Don't be- Don't walk away from me.</font>

159
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just- He'll be back.
Dee.</font>

160
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, you come off
so desperate.</font>

161
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Hollywood!
Hollywood! Hollywood!</font>

162
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No! Hey, guys.</font>

163
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here! What is that?
What are you guys doing here?</font>

164
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">We in a Hollywood situation!
Yeah.</font>

165
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dennis just got a part in the movie.
- Sweet, dude. Bump it.</font>

166
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-
- Not gonna? All right.</font>

167
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh- So where's the slumdog?
We're ready for him.</font>

168
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You finished the script already?
- No, not exactly.</font>

169
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we, uh- We didn't want
to get locked into anything,</font>

170
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we came up
with a pitch instead.</font>

171
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more like a series of ideas
in no particular order, you know?</font>

172
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We'll work out
the kinks later.</font>

173
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you hit a brick wall, huh?
Yeah. Uh...</font>

174
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Dennis can help you
with that.</font>

175
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is good at coming up with awesome words.
I wouldn't rule it out.</font>

176
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to sign him on
as a producer. That okay?</font>

177
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis? You want to be a producer?
Yeah.</font>

178
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry. - All right.
We'll work out the detes later, man.</font>

179
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe we gotta find,
like, a cooler place?</font>

180
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could we get a place
with some A.C. going?</font>

181
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a meeting and some A.
C., man. Leave it to me.</font>

182
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You guys got 30 seconds.
Blow my mind.</font>

183
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Oh, oh, oh.</font>

184
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys.
It's the prequel to The Sixth Sense.</font>

185
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fifth Sense.
The sense of smell.</font>

186
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine a super ripped,</font>

187
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">super smart scientist
in a mesh tank top...</font>

188
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">named Dr. Dolph Lundgren.</font>

189
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's-
That's not his name.</font>

190
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's played by Dolph Lundgren, but
that's not the character's name.</font>

191
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be the character's name.
No, that's...</font>

192
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">A doctor played by Dolph
Lundgren named Dolph Lundgren?</font>

193
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
That's confusing, dude.</font>

194
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">More confusing than making up an
entirely new name for a person?</font>

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gonna confuse people.
I'm taking over. I'm taking over.</font>

196
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are losing me. - Okay. Okay.
All right, all right, all right.</font>

197
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:04,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine a super smart,
ripped scientist played by Dolph Lundgren,</font>

198
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">who, after a terrible accident
in his lab, blows off his nose!</font>

199
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">After reconstructive surgery, he soon realizes
that he smells something that stinks...</font>

200
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doctor smells crime?</font>

201
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Possibly also runs around like a hound.
No! He doesn't run...</font>

202
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying, don't rule it out.
It's possible- I didn't agree to that.</font>

203
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not in any of our notes.
He might run around like a hound. What do you think?</font>

204
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, uh- All right.
First things first.</font>

205
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys gotta type some of this shit out
and get organized, for Christ's sakes.</font>

206
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your shit together. Come on.
I mean, that's ridiculous.</font>

207
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:44,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now in terms of the story, uh, clearly
it's brilliant. It's amazing.</font>

208
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great idea. Brilliant idea.
Thank you.</font>

209
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is one critical
element that's missing.</font>

210
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs a sexual punch-up.</font>

211
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get a female
lead character in there...</font>

212
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Dolph can bang
throughout the whole movie.</font>

213
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I kind of hate women though.
Oh.</font>

214
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like they just slow action
movies down too. Right, dude.</font>

215
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Mac. See, you're dead wrong on that.
You're dead wrong.</font>

216
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, one of the problems with Shyamalan's
movies is that they lack a certain eroticism.</font>

217
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we were to bring, uh,</font>

218
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">an incredibly hot but skeptical
female lab partner into the mix?</font>

219
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then that way, whenever Dolph's not out
busting heads because he's smelled crime,</font>

220
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's back at the lab performing
outrageous sexual experiments...</font>

221
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">on her supple, young body.</font>

222
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now here's the twist.
And there is a twist.</font>

223
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We show it.</font>

224
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">We show all of it.</font>

225
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because what's the one major thing missing
from all action movies these days, guys?</font>

226
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Full penetration.</font>

227
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we're gonna show
full penetration,</font>

228
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna show a lot of it.</font>

229
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we're talking, you know,
graphic scenes of Dolph Lundgren...</font>

230
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">really going to town on
this hot, young lab tech...</font>

231
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">from behind, 69, anal, vaginal,
cowgirl, reverse cowgirl...</font>

232
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the hits. All the big ones.
All the good ones.</font>

233
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he smells crime again.
He's out busting heads.</font>

234
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he's back to the lab
for some more full penetration.</font>

235
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">He smells crime.
Back to the lab, full penetration.</font>

236
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crime, penetration, crime, full
penetration, crime, penetration.</font>

237
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this goes on and on and back
and forth for 90 or so minutes...</font>

238
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">until the movie
just sort of ends.</font>

239
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is brilliant!</font>

240
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the most brilliant movie
I've ever heard in my life.</font>

241
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:32,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think audiences are gonna be very uncomfortable
seeing Dolph Lundgren's naked penis...</font>

242
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">going into this young girl
that you're talking about.</font>

243
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Just to be clear, though,
I don't care either way.</font>

244
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was worth it,
you know- 30 seconds.</font>

245
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we got the chick thing out of
it, so this is good. Yeah, 30 seconds.</font>

246
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. All right. Well, maybe
we should type this stuff up,</font>

247
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then, Frank, we'll be in touch.
Get it all together.</font>

248
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll type it up.
We'll get another thing going.</font>

249
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">And think about the representation thing.
Definitely, dude. Definitely.</font>

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You don't have to rep him.
You could just rep me.</font>

251
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Let me just get all this stuff.</font>

252
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not a writing team.
Okay. Are we good?</font>

253
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We're good.
Okay.</font>

254
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we good?
Go ahead, Charlie.</font>

255
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. And we'll get-
we'll get the...</font>

256
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, I write better without him.
Seriously. We'll talk about it.</font>

257
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know? Okay.</font>

258
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cool.</font>

259
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fifth Sense.
Here we go. Here we go.</font>

260
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write-Write- Write a couple words.
The...</font>

261
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifth-
Dude, go faster.</font>

262
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on. Hold on.
I can't- Go faster.</font>

263
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! I got it in my head.</font>

264
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just- I can't type it fast enough.
You can't type it at all.</font>

265
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could type more better, then
I think it would come out faster.</font>

266
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should get somebody else
who can type. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</font>

267
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at her, dude.</font>

268
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be good to have an older lady in the
mix, right, sort of a workhorse secretary?</font>

269
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah- I don't care for her demographic.
I find them judgmental.</font>

270
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.
You know what I mean?</font>

271
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
We need someone more our...</font>

272
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

273
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check out this one over here.
Does he look Indian to you?</font>

274
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, dude.</font>

275
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be great to have
an Indian in our corner, right?</font>

276
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. They're natural storytellers.
They're great with twists.</font>

277
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh- Psst! Psst!
- Dude!</font>

278
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, where are you from?
- Baltimore.</font>

279
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right.
Baltimore, sure.</font>

280
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are your parents from?
- Jersey.</font>

281
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. All right.
Getting nowhere here.</font>

282
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you're so-
Yeah, well, uh...</font>

283
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anyone in your
family from India? Mmm.</font>

284
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pakistan.
- Pakistan. Now that's...</font>

285
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, isn't-
a country somewhere, so...</font>

286
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the difference between
that and- Yeah, what is...</font>

287
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're right next to
each other, both countries.</font>

288
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's perfect.
Perfect.</font>

289
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's close enough, dude.
There's probably a lot of going back and forth.</font>

290
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Pakistanis are probably great with twists
too, in their own kind of way, you know?</font>

291
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. How'd you like to be
in the movie business?</font>

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, how you doing on makeup in there?
We're ready.</font>

293
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm okay, but I feel like maybe
they used a little too much blood.</font>

294
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, we need to move here.
Let's go. Let's go.</font>

295
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gut feeling is
they went a little overboard.</font>

296
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, can you even tell that it's me?
Yeah. It's perfect.</font>

297
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just need to pair you up with
a husband for the shot. - Husband?</font>

298
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
How about this guy right here?</font>

299
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll work.
That'll work.</font>

300
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!
Great.</font>

301
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit, Dee.
This is like...</font>

302
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. I could barely tell
that was you.</font>

303
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, did they dip you by your heels
into the blood? - That's ridiculous.</font>

304
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks so stupid.
Uh...</font>

305
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank had 'em go a little more subtle
with me, so you could see my face.</font>

306
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">This? This is it?
Yeah.</font>

307
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the hell
did you manage that?</font>

308
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm working my ass of.
Corpses, let's go now!</font>

309
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on, go on, go on.</font>

310
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. Go on, will ya?
Whatever.</font>

311
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

312
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody focus.
Get down now.</font>

313
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very simple shot.
Lot to do today. Lot to do.</font>

314
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need all corpses lying down.
We are losing light, people. Let's go.</font>

315
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I need you to turn over.
I need you face down. - Face down?</font>

316
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. No, 'cause then you won't
be able to see my face.</font>

317
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Face down or in the pile of
bodies over there. You pick it.</font>

318
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Face down. - That's what I thought.
All right. Energy. Energy.</font>

319
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're dead. Dead energy.
Dead energy. Here we go.</font>

320
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it. I get it.
Okay, so he's on the edge of this cliff...</font>

321
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">throwing his nose off into the ocean because
he's at the happiest point of his life.</font>

322
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the
scientist's lowest point in the movie.</font>

323
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Here. He throws his nose
of the cliff into the ocean...</font>

324
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he's- he's rejecting his
life as a savior of all of mankind.</font>

325
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I finally just got it.</font>

326
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bro, that is...</font>

327
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, that is-
That's nice.</font>

328
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deep shit, man.
That's awesome.</font>

329
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome.
It's nice.</font>

330
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you landing on the full penetration?
- I'm into it. Big time.</font>

331
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Injun says yes-
Snaking around.</font>

332
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's what we're doing, I guess.
It's done. It's on.</font>

333
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, but, but- I-I-
I mean, the title?</font>

334
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. The title.
Title sucks.</font>

335
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's stupid, yeah.
Come on.</font>

336
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Title sucks, right?
The Fifth Sense?</font>

337
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, stupid.
Well, yeah.</font>

338
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who came up- Who came
up with that? - Uh...</font>

339
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid.
Come on, man.</font>

340
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">So stupid.
You kidding?</font>

341
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why don't you type out
this whole movie real quick,</font>

342
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll go sell it to Shyamalan.
Yeah.</font>

343
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. I don't write.
I'm a big picture kind of guy.</font>

344
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't write.
You don't... write.</font>

345
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

346
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- Dennis, hey.</font>

347
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hit a wall on the pitch.
Uh, what pitch is that, man?</font>

348
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The pitch of the movie that you're a producer on.
- Oh, yeah. That thing. Yeah.</font>

349
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's up with that?
- We realized that none of us are writers,</font>

350
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we decided to play to our
strengths and make a poster.</font>

351
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">What tells a person about a movie better
than a picture of what the movie is?</font>

352
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are your thoughts?</font>

353
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are my thoughts?
My thoughts are that's brilliant.</font>

354
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's cool.
Cut!</font>

355
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?
What are you doing?</font>

356
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, shit. Were you guys rolling on that?
- Yes. We were rolling on that.</font>

357
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not talk on your phone
during the shot.</font>

358
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? And you, ma'am?</font>

359
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, me?
- Do not roll over during the shot.</font>

360
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know, but you know what?
I thought about it.</font>

361
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel like it's better if I'm
right side up. - Back over.</font>

362
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Back over!
Face down on the hot cement!"</font>

363
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's roll it again, people.
- "Yeah, again!"</font>

364
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brains! Brains!</font>

365
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell are you doing?</font>

366
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? You.
Why are you saying "brains"? What...</font>

367
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, 'cause it's a zombie movie.
It's, like, the Shyamalan twist. I figured it out.</font>

368
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a zombie movie.
It's a movie about Serbian genocide.</font>

369
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Huh.</font>

370
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! Sir! Yes, sir.
Your phone, it's ringing.</font>

371
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. I know.
But listen, man.</font>

372
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't let me answer it and solve my
boys' problems, the phone's gonna ring.</font>

373
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't have it both ways.
Can I talk or not?</font>

374
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I gotta agree with him
on that one, buddy.</font>

375
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not being very clear.
Which is it?</font>

376
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn your phone of! You, miss!
Don't improvise! Let's go!</font>

377
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay! You know what? I have had about
enough of you dicking me around all day.</font>

378
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Where is M. Night?
I have questions for him. Yeah.</font>

379
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. Mr. Shyamalan isn't directing this unit.
This is a simple pickup shot.</font>

380
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.</font>

381
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the hell is M. Night?
He's not here?</font>

382
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. What the hell's
going on here?</font>

383
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, he won't get of his phone, for starters.
- Give me your phone, Dennis.</font>

384
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Give me your phone.</font>

385
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
I heard that.</font>

386
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'll tell you
exactly what's going on.</font>

387
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy's been treating me
like a dickwad all day long,</font>

388
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't appreciate it.
Ha, ha, ha!</font>

389
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'm gonna fix it, hon.
Thank you.</font>

390
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire both of them and I'll
take their spot. What?</font>

391
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Done. You're both fired. - Hold on a second.
What are you talking about, Frank?</font>

392
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being an agent is crap.
I want to be an extra, lay around doing dick.</font>

393
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. Both of you, get your shit
out of the tent. Get out of here.</font>

394
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, fine.
Hey, give me my phone back, Frank. What?</font>

395
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just to be clear, pal.
I don't care about any of this.</font>

396
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my own thing
going on, so...</font>

397
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just gave you
the old Shyamalan twist.</font>

398
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, maybe you did, maybe you
didn't, but I'll tell you what.</font>

399
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care either.</font>

400
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. What do I do?</font>

401
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey-oh!</font>

402
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, where his he, dude?
Where's Night?</font>

403
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got it!
Dude, we totally got it.</font>

404
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brace yourself!
Brace yourself!</font>

405
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crime Stinks:
The Smell of Penetration.</font>

406

407
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, yeah.
I get it. Get it?</font>

408
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I-I get it. Now, there is a lot
going on there with- with Dolph.</font>

409
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had to make some artistic compromises.
I think we're good with the body.</font>

410
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's a lovable character.
It's a lovable guy.</font>

411
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, these are
good compromises.</font>

412
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bottom line, M. Night's gonna love it.
So where is he?</font>

413
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Night? Uh, well-
Oh, he's not here.</font>

414
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, Dee.
What happened to you?</font>

415
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">He brought in a "B" team
or something like that,</font>

416
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">covered me all in blood.</font>

417
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">That slumdog bastard
twisted all of us!</font>

418
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, dude.
We need him to execute our script. Yeah.</font>

419
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you guys don't need
Shyamalan to execute your script...</font>

420
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:58,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I've got the mother of all
Shyamalan twists in my hand right here.</font>

421
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, you think I've just been
playing with my phone the whole time,</font>

422
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're wrong.</font>

423
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been writing a little
movie script of my own,</font>

424
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I finished it right
before you guys called.</font>

425
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a horror movie about two men
trapped in a garage stairwell...</font>

426
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">who get hunted down by a
psychotic, homeless killer...</font>

427
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">who turns out to be
a security guard... instead.</font>

428
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's our story, dude.
- Damn right, it's your story.</font>

429
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why you two guys
are gonna be attached as producers.</font>

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice, baby!
Producers!</font>

431
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!
I feel like that's...</font>

432
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a natural born producer.
I love showbiz, dude. I love showbiz.</font>

433
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, can I be in it?
Uh, you know, normally, Dee,</font>

434
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would take this
opportunity to insult you,</font>

435
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna throw
an insane twist your way.</font>

436
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be the lead of the film.
I am? Really?</font>

437
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not. Twisted again!
Boom! Try and keep up.</font>

438
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lot of twists. Lot of twists in
this thing, so try and keep up.</font>

439
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's so many twists,
I can't even follow it.</font>

440
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's tough to follow.
I'm gonna pull up the first scene...</font>

441
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you guys can get a taste of what
else is going on in this film.</font>

442
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Lay us on it.
It's really good.</font>

443
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh- For some reason the phone
is frozen- Lay it on us.</font>

444
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm having a little trouble
pulling up the scene...</font>

445
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why is there grease
all over...</font>

446
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this Frank's g-
goddamn sausage grease?</font>

447
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you froze my phone
with your sausage greasy fingers!</font>

448
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you son of a bitch!</font>

449
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut! Cut!
For the love of Christ!</font>
