00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,929

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have I done?</font>

15
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did what you had to do.</font>

16
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed a man once.</font>

17
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a... a hijacker.</font>

18
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was going to shoot me.</font>

19
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't know I had a gun in the truck.</font>

20
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you live with that?</font>

21
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">It changes you.</font>

22
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you go on.
You have to, Juliana.</font>

23
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You read my letter.</font>

24
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got worried after you said you might not come back.</font>

25
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

26
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you.</font>

27
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you just, uh, try and get some sleep.</font>

28
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:58,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

29
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the morning we'll get you home.</font>

30
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't go home.</font>

31
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Juliana, has it ever occurred to you</font>

32
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">that maybe there is no contact?</font>

33
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">That your sister would have walked
into the same trap you just did?</font>

34
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to do this.</font>

35
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to.</font>

36
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, that guy tonight</font>

37
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">was most likely a Nazi agent.</font>

38
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

39
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you know both of us would be killed</font>

40
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">if anyone found out what happened.</font>

41
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never meant for you to be there.</font>

42
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you didn't, but I was.</font>

43
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:46,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's going to come looking for that man,</font>

44
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can't be here when they do.</font>

45
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister Laura and her children
will be exterminated.</font>

46
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lie, Frank.</font>

47
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">That film can change the world.</font>

48
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Juliana Crain?</font>

49
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay strong.</font>

50
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">a woman who thinks you are a failure?</font>

51
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tough choice, Frank.</font>

52
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it worth dying for?</font>

53
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?</font>

54
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost something.</font>

55
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drawing.</font>

56
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to get going.</font>

57
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clerk's not up yet.</font>

58
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's your key.</font>

59
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What are you doing?</font>

60
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checking out.</font>

61
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. That man dies,</font>

62
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">and suddenly we just disappear.</font>

63
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that going to look?</font>

64
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:46,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like we left.</font>

65
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't wait around here.</font>

66
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll leave— not in a hurry and not together.</font>

67
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, what if you drive out of town this morning</font>

68
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I stay at the diner till after lunch?</font>

69
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'll meet you.</font>

70
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

71
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wait outside town.</font>

72
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

73
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get ready for work.</font>

74
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope I didn't scare you.</font>

75
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You okay?</font>

76
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

77
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your door was open.
This was on your step.</font>

78
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus.</font>

79
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">They really did a number on this place.</font>

80
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it say?</font>

81
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You confirm these as the bodies</font>

82
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Laura Frink Crothers,</font>

83
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,532

84
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sign here.</font>

85
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,971

86
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Frink?</font>

87
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">As enemies of the state,</font>

88
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">they've lost all burial rights.</font>

89
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be cremated</font>

00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">within the next seven to ten days.</font>

91
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll receive notice in the mail.</font>

92
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

93
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you got a cigarette?</font>

94
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:15,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Sure.</font>

95
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey, let me.</font>

96
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go, pal.</font>

97
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that about?</font>

98
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better not to ask.</font>

99
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Here by popular demand,</font>

100
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">your occupying overlords
the Crown Prince and Princess.</font>

101
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck 'em.</font>

102
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
We got to get to work.</font>

103
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going.</font>

104
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, you didn't call in sick yesterday.</font>

105
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You miss today—</font>

106
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll tell them that you're so sick,</font>

107
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't make it to the phone,</font>

108
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're puking up blood and organs and shit.</font>

109
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

110
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Connolly.</font>

111
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joe Blake with a progress report, line 2.</font>

112
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, Joe.</font>

113
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, sir.</font>

114
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still no word from our contact?</font>

115
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what else I can do</font>

116
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">except show myself and wait.</font>

117
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about your, uh, S.D. man?</font>

118
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one who makes the origami?</font>

119
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He seemed to have left town.</font>

120
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

121
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">So should you.</font>

122
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why?</font>

123
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been two days, Joe.</font>

124
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they were going to contact you,</font>

125
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:10,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'd have done it by now.</font>

126
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the mission's a failure?</font>

127
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not necessarily.
You still have the film.</font>

128
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just getting the film wasn't my objective, sir.</font>

129
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

130
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it wasn't.</font>

131
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.
What did I do wrong?</font>

132
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps nothing.</font>

133
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have a full debriefing when you get back.</font>

134
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand me, Joe?</font>

135
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">My orders are clear?</font>

136
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir, very clear.</font>

137
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heil Hitler.</font>

138
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heil Hitler.</font>

139
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

140
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank, it's me.</font>

141
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:31,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

142
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Jules.</font>

143
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been so worried about you, Frank.</font>

144
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to reach you a few times.</font>

145
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, but there's no phone at the campsite, is there?</font>

146
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

147
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, there isn't.</font>

148
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you left your necklace.</font>

149
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured if you saw it, you'd know I left.</font>

150
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I— I'm sorry, Frank.</font>

151
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay, Frank?</font>

152
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

153
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank—</font>

154
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss you so much.</font>

155
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I got to go.</font>

156
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I— I love you, Frank.</font>

157
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

158
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

159
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me.</font>

160
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where I can find the attendant here?</font>

161
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, thanks, buddy.</font>

162
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bucket.</font>

163
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hey, Marshal.
What can I do for you?</font>

164
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gas.</font>

165
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, can I get s—</font>

166
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

167
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody.</font>

168
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your truck, nobody?</font>

169
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

170
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:26,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see your I.D. papers.</font>

171
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't any cops around here,
so the way I see it—</font>

172
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

173
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let me get it out of the truck first.</font>

174
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in the truck, Joe Blake?</font>

175
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coffee makers.</font>

176
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

177
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:07,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, can I get some of that?</font>

178
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bucket, you seen this fella?</font>

179
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.
Who is he?</font>

180
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a friend.</font>

181
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lot of guys look like him.</font>

182
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy makes little paper animals.</font>

183
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,138

<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

185
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talking to Carl over at the bookstore.</font>

186
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

187
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get a cup of coffee.</font>

188
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Bucket, fill it up, will you?</font>

189
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were leaving.</font>

190
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pour the coffee.</font>

191
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

192
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a man out there</font>

193
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a sawed-off shotgun,</font>

194
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's looking for a friend of his.</font>

195
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">That didn't take long.</font>

196
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to figure out pretty fast</font>

197
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">that that man's dead.</font>

198
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we do?</font>

199
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">We leave.</font>

200
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">First we have to get rid of something.</font>

201
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll meet you out back.</font>

202
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

203
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:27,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you should be careful</font>

204
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">who you should make friends with out here.</font>

205
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not so bad.</font>

206
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trudy, I'm not your friend.</font>

207
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. There you are.</font>

208
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">12 marks.</font>

209
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shew.</font>

210
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how much a tank costs in the Reich?</font>

211
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky I got any gas at all.</font>

212
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, who is that guy?</font>

213
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calls himself the Marshal.</font>

214
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a dirty old bounty hunter.</font>

215
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Likes to call himself that.</font>

216
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll want to steer clear.</font>

217
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Thanks.</font>

218
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that smell in here?</font>

219
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you describe it?</font>

220
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't say.</font>

221
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. You couldn't say.</font>

222
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably spend so much time in here,</font>

223
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">you don't notice.</font>

224
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old books.</font>

225
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got the stink of their owner.</font>

226
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cigarettes and coffee, cat piss, smell of decay.</font>

227
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for a friend of mine</font>

228
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">who was supposed to meet me this morning.</font>

229
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't show.</font>

230
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seen him?</font>

231
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-Yeah, I did a couple days ago.</font>

232
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he want in here?</font>

233
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:29,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to lie to me, Carl.</font>

234
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

235
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">H-He bought a Bible.</font>

236
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tsk tsk tsk.</font>

237
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going around selling Bibles?</font>

238
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to find my friend, Carl.</font>

239
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know where he is, I swear.</font>

240
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

241
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He send anyone else in here buying Bibles?</font>

242
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

243
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">a girl.</font>

244
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, she's in her 20s...</font>

245
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">brown hair,</font>

246
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">pretty.</font>

247
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you wouldn't know</font>

248
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I could find this pretty girl, would you?</font>

249
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

250
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:27,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selling Bibles is a risky business, Carl.</font>

251
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">There isn't a law against it.</font>

252
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only because there's no law around here,</font>

253
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">it doesn't make it right, does it?</font>

254
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many you got back there?</font>

255
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six, maybe seven.</font>

256
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I— I'll burn them.</font>

257
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be wise, Carl.</font>

258
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is your name, right?</font>

259
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl?</font>

260
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-Yes.</font>

261
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:12,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?</font>

262
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:27,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure it isn't...</font>

263
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">David?</font>

264
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">David P. Frees?</font>

265
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salem, Ohio,</font>

266
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">escaped from a camp outside New Berlin in '54?</font>

267
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir, that's not me.</font>

268
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it is.</font>

269
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill you now.</font>

270
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing you can say or do about that.</font>

271
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm going to need something first.</font>

272
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Baynes.</font>

273
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trade Minister.</font>

274
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:32,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lovely day and a long time coming.</font>

275
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you intend to proceed?</font>

276
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need the name of my contact.</font>

277
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:48,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man over there—
suit and blue tie.</font>

278
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's Shimura, Science Minister.</font>

279
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:53,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you told him?</font>

280
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing yet.</font>

281
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this some kind of a joke?</font>

282
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Baynes, you have not exposed yourself,</font>

283
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">and neither have I,</font>

284
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">nor will I until I must.</font>

285
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:06,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is when?</font>

286
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">During His Highness' speech.</font>

287
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Nazi Embassy.</font>

288
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">In front of all those people?</font>

289
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crowd will provide cover.</font>

290
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only opportunity.</font>

291
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy, what are you doing out here?</font>

292
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you,</font>

293
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">12-hour flight from Tokyo,</font>

294
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use a belt.</font>

295
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, what happened?</font>

296
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:54,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You run into a pole or something?</font>

297
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gone, Bill.</font>

298
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?
Laura's usually home by now.</font>

299
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not coming home.</font>

300
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:14,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

301
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:16,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, Bill, I am so sorry.</font>

302
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

303
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kempeitai, they killed them.</font>

304
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">They— They just killed them last night.</font>

305
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kempeitai?</font>

306
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

307
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes no sense.</font>

308
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are you saying?</font>

309
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:32,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kids?</font>

310
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">They— They said they were Jews.</font>

311
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're not.</font>

312
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our grandfather was Jewish,</font>

313
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Laura's and mine.</font>

314
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that means you're a Jew, right?</font>

315
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't they kill you?</font>

316
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I— I don't know.</font>

317
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bill, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</font>

318
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get away from me, Frank.
- Please, Bill.</font>

319
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bill!
- I said get the hell away from me!</font>

320
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up!</font>

321
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm done,</font>

322
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">tie him off.</font>

323
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:02,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him here.</font>

324
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand?</font>

325
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cuts that body down</font>

326
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">till the birds pick it clean.</font>

327
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We administered</font>

328
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">200 micrograms of D-lysergic acid</font>

329
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">30 minutes ago.</font>

330
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Advanced interrogation technique.</font>

331
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's intended to break down inhibitions,</font>

332
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">psychic barriers,</font>

333
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">inducing a sensation of oneness.</font>

334
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oneness?</font>

335
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some describe it as an oceanic experience,</font>

336
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">a unity with all things.</font>

337
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fail to see how that would lead</font>

338
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the disclosure of information.</font>

339
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">In such a state,</font>

340
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">the subject feels no reason to hold anything back.</font>

341
00:30:57,955 --> 00:31:01,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no reason since he is
connected to everything and everyone.</font>

342
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Meyer.</font>

343
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know the route</font>

344
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">my car would be taking yesterday?</font>

345
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have an informant in my office?</font>

346
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a halo.</font>

347
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">The medication often induces hallucinations.</font>

348
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:39,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the name of your informant.</font>

349
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an angel.</font>

350
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.
Will you bring him out of this?</font>

351
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am deeply sorry, Obergruppenführer.</font>

352
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:58,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I cannot do that.
- You can't?</font>

353
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once administered,</font>

354
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">it takes hours for the medication to wear off.</font>

355
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

356
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:07,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this man tries to kill me,</font>

357
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we reward him with an oceanic experience.</font>

358
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:18,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you tell me when this
little fantasy has worn off?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky to be alive.</font>

391
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,936

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

397
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,653

398
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to them.</font>

399
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randall—</font>

400
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Randall was in the next cell.</font>

401
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He didn't say anything.
- You sure about that?</font>

402
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why they shot him.</font>

403
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, relax, Frank.</font>

404
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:06,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the same side here.</font>

405
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not on your side.</font>

406
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:13,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your side got my sister killed and her kids.</font>

407
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">My side didn't kill them.
The pawns did.</font>

408
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of us paid a price like you, Frank.</font>

409
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost my husband and two brothers.</font>

410
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">They— They come at us with guns and gas chambers,</font>

411
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you, hmm?
You just aim a movie at them.</font>

412
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you put some of their
blood on the streets for a change?</font>

413
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that simple, Frank.
We weaken the Japs too much,</font>

414
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:33,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're just begging Berlin to drop another bomb.</font>

415
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you just watch old movies.</font>

416
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">The films are more important than you know.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ So hush, little baby ♪</font>

419
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are honored that you found time in your schedule</font>

420
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">to visit with us, Your Highness.</font>

421
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">The solidarity between our nations</font>

422
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">is foremost in my mind, Ambassador Reiss.</font>

423
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's time we greeted our subjects</font>

424
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the Pacific States in person.</font>

425
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:15,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, which makes my next request very difficult.</font>

426
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:20,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">We respectfully request</font>

427
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the Crown Prince cancel his public address</font>

428
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside the Embassy.</font>

429
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:25,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a proper request</font>

430
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be made in the presence of His Highness.</font>

431
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Trade Minister.</font>

432
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to hear why.</font>

433
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want to hear it from the person</font>

434
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually making the request.</font>

435
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have received word from New York.</font>

436
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Resistance are stepping up their attacks.</font>

437
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand and thank you for your concern,</font>

438
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my Imperial Guard and the Kempeitai</font>

439
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">provide excellent security.</font>

440
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have obtained evidence</font>

441
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:01,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the Resistance are in
possession of false travel papers.</font>

442
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have knowledge of such a threat</font>

443
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">against the Crown Prince?</font>

444
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not direct knowledge, no,</font>

445
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the safety of Your Highness</font>

446
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:13,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">is our paramount concern.</font>

447
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Ambassador,</font>

448
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:21,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will address my people in person.</font>

449
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ask that your guards remain vigilant, Mr. Tagomi,</font>

450
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we certainly will.</font>

451
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:37,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for the tea and your hospitality.</font>

452
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you aware of any threats
such as Oberführer mentioned?</font>

453
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are many threats, Trade Minister,</font>

454
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:16,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">not least from Nazi agents seeking to destabilize us</font>

455
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">and blame their crimes on subversives.</font>

456
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:23,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're comfortable with
the Crown Prince proceeding?</font>

457
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Imperial Guard vouch for his safety.</font>

458
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the false travel papers?</font>

459
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about them?</font>

460
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who might be carrying them or if in fact they exist.</font>

461
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matters of internal security</font>

462
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">do not concern the Trade Ministry.</font>

463
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:53,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obergruppenführer, the subject is recovered</font>

464
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">from his exposure to the D-lysergic acid.</font>

465
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he needs to see you and only you.</font>

466
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mister.</font>

467
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:38,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.</font>

468
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:40,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're looking for that man,</font>

469
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one who makes the paper birds?</font>

470
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:45,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I am?</font>

471
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where he went.</font>

472
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me 2 marks, and I'll tell you.</font>

473
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me or I'll kill you.</font>

474
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him drive down that way</font>

475
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">late last night.</font>

476
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of car?</font>

477
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:05,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">An old one, black.</font>

478
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was he going?</font>

479
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:07,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

480
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.</font>

481
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is this far?</font>

482
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a couple miles, maybe.</font>

483
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">He marked it on the map.</font>

484
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think it is?</font>

485
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you're thinking.</font>

486
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do not have time for this.</font>

487
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to come.
I'm doing this.</font>

488
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, haven't you had enough?</font>

489
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Connolly.</font>

490
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:32,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Connolly, please join us.</font>

491
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Obergruppenführer.</font>

492
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see,</font>

493
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Meyer has recovered from his hallucinations.</font>

494
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just told me something very interesting.</font>

495
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

496
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he tell you?</font>

497
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's named you as a conspirator.</font>

498
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:05,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's r—
That's ridiculous.</font>

499
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's obviously a lie.</font>

500
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he name you?</font>

501
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

502
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never met this man.</font>

503
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:21,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">An informant doesn't have
to meet his co-conspirators.</font>

504
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

505
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:30,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he just has to pass on the information.</font>

506
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">What information?</font>

507
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:35,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">The route of my car, Captain.</font>

508
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've only been loyal, Obergruppenführer.</font>

509
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever he said, he's lying.</font>

510
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him now.</font>

511
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">This— This man is lying.</font>

512
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so, Captain.</font>

513
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:01,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Meyer has given me a very detailed account</font>

514
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">of how you passed on the information.</font>

515
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explain yourself.</font>

516
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obergruppenführer, I—</font>

517
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-it's not true.</font>

518
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell him it's not true.</font>

519
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Th-There's no proof,</font>

520
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">just the word of this Semite.</font>

521
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Captain.</font>

522
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have nothing to confess.</font>

523
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me now.
- Please, this is a trick.</font>

524
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:24,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lie.</font>

525
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying I'm a fool?</font>

526
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've allowed myself to be deceived?</font>

527
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course not.</font>

528
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's telling the truth.</font>

529
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not!
Please tell him you're lying.</font>

530
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

531
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:52,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew he was lying.</font>

532
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I suspected.</font>

533
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may be relieved, Captain,</font>

534
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we still don't know how they got to us.</font>

535
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I come in?</font>

536
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a drink?</font>

537
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've just been to the Kempeitai.</font>

538
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:24,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't tell me exactly what happened,</font>

539
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they did say it wasn't about Laura and the kids.</font>

540
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was about your crazy fucking girlfriend.</font>

541
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It wasn't like that.
- This is her fault.</font>

542
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">She and that sister of hers did something</font>

543
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">and dragged the rest of us into it.</font>

544
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the only reason they're dead.</font>

545
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:40,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tortured me.
They beat me.</font>

546
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

547
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">For, uh, information I couldn't give them.</font>

548
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't or wouldn't?</font>

549
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not kill Laura and the kids.</font>

550
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kempeitai did.</font>

551
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is their country, Frank!</font>

552
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it?</font>

553
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:01,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

554
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I get it.</font>

555
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always wanted to have kids, didn't you, Frank?</font>

556
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hope you do one day,</font>

557
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I hope they're taken away from you</font>

558
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you took mine from me</font>

559
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you could feel the same pain I'm feeling.</font>

560
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">sail upon this ship do their duty</font>

561
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">with honor and integrity</font>

562
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the betterment of our glorious empire.</font>

563
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Royal Highness the Crown Prince</font>

564
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess</font>

565
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">began the day at the Shinto Temple</font>

566
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the Pan Pacific park</font>

567
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">by making their offering to Amaterasu,</font>

568
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Goddess of the Sun.</font>

569
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">In one of the highlights of the Crown Prince's visit,</font>

570
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will speak in front of the
Nazi embassy in a public address.</font>

571
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">All subjects of the Pacific States are invited.</font>

572
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty girl.</font>

573
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should just be up through those trees.</font>

574
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming with me.</font>

575
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:11,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't be doing this.</font>

576
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand you.</font>

577
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would if you saw that film.</font>

578
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:17,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? A film that shows another world?
So what?</font>

579
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:20,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it means that maybe things
don't have to be this way.</font>

580
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the world can change.</font>

581
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how.</font>

582
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like Frank.</font>

583
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm starting to like Frank.</font>

584
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever think how different life could be</font>

585
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:39,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you could change just one thing?</font>

586
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

587
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad died during the war.</font>

588
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know who I'd be if that hadn't happened.</font>

589
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

590
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hold up a second.</font>

591
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I lied to you, too.</font>

592
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm following in my father's footsteps,</font>

593
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe I'm not.</font>

594
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never even met him.</font>

595
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't married to my—
my mother, and—</font>

596
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:46,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">he doesn't live near us.
He never took any interest.</font>

597
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

598
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whew.
Yeah, well, I don't know</font>

599
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">why I felt I had to tell you this.</font>

600
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you did.</font>

601
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, m-maybe you're right.</font>

602
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe if I'd met you sooner,</font>

603
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">my life would be a whole lot different.</font>

604
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you have.</font>

605
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it will be.</font>

606
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Frank.</font>

607
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, buddy?</font>

608
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to work to eat.</font>

609
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good. Great.</font>

610
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, did you tell Mr. Wyndam-Matson you're here?</font>

611
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. I told him.</font>

612
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good. It's, uh,</font>

613
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">good to have you back, Frank.</font>

614
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really good.</font>

615
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's got to be it.</font>

616
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

617
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

618
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a woman.</font>

619
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:18,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

620
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's their names.</font>

621
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,952
