and you choose to rob us?</font>

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I... I need
to get to the train.</font>

3
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've broken my father.</font>

4
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:27,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wildly unstable...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">bouncing between old roles.</font>

6
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:32,880

complex encryption key.</font>

put him down with the rest.</font>

11
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.</font>

12
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:07,895

00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,739

We have to go!</font>

15
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,942

right now!</font>

00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:46,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

21
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dredging's almost
at fifty percent.</font>

22
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:50,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should have the rest of them
skimmed up by end of day.</font>

23
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also started draining
the valley.</font>

24
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want all personal effects,
or just skin and bones?</font>

25
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything.
Down to the last Stetson.</font>

26
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fly the whole pile over.</font>

27
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:03,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll crack 'em open to see if
we can't reprogram these things</font>

28
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to behave by our rules again.
- Copy that.</font>

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I have two teams out
looking for Abernathy.</font>

30
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

31
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:13,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you find him,
bring him to me personally.</font>

32
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, what have we got?
- It's not good.</font>

33
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're pulling what we can off the
recovered host control units.</font>

34
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what's really unsettling</font>

35
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:57,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">is... what's in
about a third of them.</font>

36
00:04:57,383 --> 00:05:00,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And what's that?
- Nothing.</font>

37
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They've been wiped?
- More like they're virgin.</font>

38
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like they never held data
to begin with.</font>

39
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">No user prints
or anything.</font>

40
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's not
the worst of it.</font>

41
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a look.</font>

42
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've put the fires out,</font>

43
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's nothing
we can recover from the Cradle.</font>

44
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts' backups
have all been destroyed.</font>

45
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we've effectively lost a third
of our IP in a single sweep.</font>

46
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:35,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's quite a story
you gave them...</font>

47
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one hell of an ending.</font>

48
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did all
these disparate threads</font>

49
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">come together to create
this nightmare?</font>

50
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:55,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we figure that out,
we'll know how the story turns.</font>

51
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's that?</font>

52
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:26,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like a dead man to me.</font>

53
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the old saying
about knives and gunfights?</font>

54
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the saying have a footnote
about fucking lassos, then?</font>

55
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
that's enough.</font>

56
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lay down your sword.</font>

57
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your associates
to set us free.</font>

58
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">We mean no harm.</font>

59
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, darling?</font>

60
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything under control.</font>

61
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beautiful way
to watch the sunrise.</font>

62
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glistening off the intestines
of the recently mutilated.</font>

63
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus. Ohh.</font>

64
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judging by their weapons,</font>

65
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say local police.</font>

66
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">And given that
he's got one now...</font>

67
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:35,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captured by samurai cop-killers.</font>

68
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck me!</font>

69
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you...
say something to them?</font>

70
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm from Honk Kong,
asshole.</font>

71
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just the tip
of Shogun World's prick.</font>

72
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">An experience
expressly designed</font>

73
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the guests
who find Westworld too tame.</font>

74
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:55,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We based this park
on Japan's Edo period</font>

75
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:58,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the true aficionado
of artful gore.</font>

76
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world will end badly,</font>

77
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll make sure
your end is worse!</font>

78
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand them?</font>

79
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all do. Look,
she's a Madam...</font>

80
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consciously fluent
in dozens of languages,</font>

81
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:30,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">including Japanese.</font>

82
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you all have
those com skills</font>

83
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">buried somewhere
in your code.</font>

84
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is,</font>

85
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:43,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fact that
these psychos</font>

86
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't flip to English
as soon as I opened my mouth</font>

87
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">means that the same
malfunctioning shitshow</font>

88
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:52,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's playing out in Westworld
has found its way here.</font>

89
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's also why your vocal
voodoo didn't work on them...</font>

90
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You spoke
the wrong language.</font>

91
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">This all feels
a little too familiar.</font>

92
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a...
a butterfly?</font>

93
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">A mariposa.</font>

94
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be damned.</font>

95
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's us.</font>

96
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, fine,</font>

97
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have cribbed
a little bit from Westworld.</font>

98
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:17,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you trying writing
300 stories in three weeks.</font>

99
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-W-We're human shields now?</font>

100
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Shogun World.</font>

101
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:47,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

102
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:50,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you watch it?</font>

103
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Behind you!</font>

104
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell of a homecoming.</font>

105
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetwater was never
home to begin with, Teddy.</font>

106
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I were born long before
this place even existed.</font>

107
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:07,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's the place I
return to again and again.</font>

108
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:10,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how far I strayed,</font>

109
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">somethin' always...
carried me back.</font>

110
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:18,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somethin' like that?</font>

111
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like she's taken some
hits the past few days.</font>

112
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who hasn't?</font>

113
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a thorough inspection</font>

114
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the engine
to the last axle.</font>

115
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:56,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fix what's broke,</font>

116
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">strip her for speed.</font>

117
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teddy.</font>

118
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">With me.</font>

119
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we need
the train for, Dolores?</font>

120
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:27,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've taken my daddy.</font>

121
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're gonna get him back.</font>

122
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it ain't doin' any good
sittin' in that bottle.</font>

123
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Maeve.</font>

124
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't get much sleep
last night.</font>

125
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes...</font>

126
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes
they're real bad.</font>

127
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clementine?</font>

128
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're new.</font>

129
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much of a rind on you.</font>

130
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

131
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rejoin the others.</font>

132
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I
told you, Teddy...</font>

133
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">this place was never home.</font>

134
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's ride.
There's someplace I want to see.</font>

135
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I asked for
a civilized conversation,</font>

136
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant the quickest way
out of here, not all this.</font>

137
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:37,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just try and rein it
in a bit, will you?</font>

138
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">The narrative bones of this
place are just like Westworld.</font>

139
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hospitality is the foreplay
to a new quest.</font>

140
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:46,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in this world,
if you don't hear them out,</font>

141
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:49,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've dishonored them...
Sometimes homicidally so.</font>

142
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. We'll listen.</font>

143
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then we go
and find my daughter.</font>

144
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for the record,</font>

145
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not just the narrative
bones that are identical.</font>

146
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:03,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've plagiarized
our stories, our identities...</font>

147
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:05,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not plagiarism.</font>

148
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supply and demand.</font>

149
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you're asking
can you trust Akane,</font>

150
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:12,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">the real question is:
can you trust yourself?</font>

151
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:14,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who
I don't trust?</font>

152
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him.</font>

153
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say the word
and I'll skin him like a rabbit.</font>

154
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter with you?</font>

155
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not supposed to be here.</font>

156
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows how seeing
your own doppel-bot</font>

157
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">is gonna fuck with
your cognition?</font>

158
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:33,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heightened aggression
and suspicion.</font>

159
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feedback loops.
That.</font>

160
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet another reason to get out
of here tout fuckin' suite.</font>

161
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our quest, I presume?</font>

162
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recognize this one.</font>

163
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called
"Army of Blood."</font>

164
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam Akane,</font>

165
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">a mere geisha,</font>

166
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:17,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">has no choice
but to give up Sakura.</font>

167
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not
supposed to happen.</font>

168
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:39,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone
had a choice after all.</font>

169
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow Lake is her cornerstone,</font>

170
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:18,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it also has an access point
back to the tunnels.</font>

171
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:20,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's our way out.</font>

172
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:23,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're not so useless
after all.</font>

173
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have something
to do with this?</font>

174
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of you.
Look.</font>

175
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oy!</font>

176
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:54,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit! Ninjas!</font>

177
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:56,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fucking hell!</font>

178
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:10,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

179
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:12,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

180
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

181
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:58,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got three.
The rest vanished with Sakura.</font>

182
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:00,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane.</font>

183
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ninjas never show up
in this story.</font>

184
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck!</font>

185
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:23,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Shogun's army
never comes into town.</font>

186
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You three, with me.</font>

187
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need
to know the language</font>

188
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">to know a puckered asshole
of a man when I see one.</font>

189
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I spent
a lot of time here.</font>

190
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:09,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watchin' the herd...</font>

191
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">talkin' about
makin' a life together.</font>

192
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday.</font>

193
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:24,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I just wanted to
see it one last time.</font>

194
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if someday
was right now?</font>

195
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:37,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talkin' about,
Teddy?</font>

196
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:41,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a fight comin',
Dolores.</font>

197
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's gonna be one
that's gonna change us</font>

198
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">in ways we can't even
begin to predict.</font>

199
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm still waking up to...</font>

200
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:52,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I really am.</font>

201
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:57,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if that means I'm free,
then we both are.</font>

202
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free to walk away.</font>

203
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:05,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you can't tell me that somewhere
out there in all that beauty...</font>

204
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:08,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">there isn't a spot for us.</font>

205
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:20,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ever tell you about the
year we almost lost the herd?</font>

206
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:24,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bluetongue.</font>

207
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:28,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quarantined the cows
that had it, but...</font>

208
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:31,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">it kept spreading
all the same.</font>

209
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:36,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy finally figured out that it
wasn't spreading from cow to cow,</font>

210
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was the flies
that carried it.</font>

211
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">He worried over it
all night.</font>

212
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you stop
a sickness like that?</font>

213
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">One with wings.</font>

214
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it was you.</font>

215
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you do, Teddy?</font>

216
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd give 'em shelter.</font>

217
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:06,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">House the weakest in a barn, out
of the air, away from the flies...</font>

218
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">until it passed.</font>

219
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a kind man.</font>

220
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy burned 'em.</font>

221
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The weak and the infected.</font>

222
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made a pyre
that went on for days.</font>

223
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:31,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it stank, but...</font>

224
00:32:32,138 --> 00:32:34,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">the flies hate smoke.</font>

225
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">The herd lived.</font>

226
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll think about
what you said.</font>

227
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to take this moment to
appeal to your sense of survival.</font>

228
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Shogun
is awake enough</font>

229
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:07,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">to play fast and loose with
his ninjas and his army,</font>

230
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:11,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">then the odds of us surviving here have
dropped to approximately fuck-all.</font>

231
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I say we ditch Akane
and make a run for Snow Lake.</font>

232
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:17,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?</font>

233
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">P-P-Present company excluded,
of course.</font>

234
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:23,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">That machine's name
is Sakura.</font>

235
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:24,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't keep doing this to us,</font>

236
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">giving us people to love and
then getting upset when we do.</font>

237
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:30,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But it's just fucking code.
- You're wrong.</font>

238
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coded to care about
nobody but myself,</font>

239
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:35,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet here I am, willing to
risk my life for someone else.</font>

240
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, so much for
your so-called daughter.</font>

241
00:33:39,174 --> 00:33:41,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to go it alone,
be my guest.</font>

242
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">But mention my daughter
one more time</font>

243
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will snap you
like a matchstick.</font>

244
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:49,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you did that ninja?</font>

245
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took one look at you
and self-impaled.</font>

246
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you do that?</font>

247
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

248
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was no voice command.</font>

249
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm finding
a new voice.</font>

250
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our transportation is ready.</font>

251
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamnit.</font>

252
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:28,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have they done
to the place?</font>

253
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:35,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that...?</font>

254
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fucking cavalry.</font>

255
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. So
much for our rescuers.</font>

256
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:06,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna take
a fuckin' moment.</font>

257
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't stop
on my account.</font>

258
00:35:35,193 --> 00:35:36,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you've quite finished.</font>

259
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to sell this ruse.</font>

260
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many of them
are there?</font>

261
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between the camp
and the town?</font>

262
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hundreds.</font>

263
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Literally hundreds.</font>

264
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Maeve's gonna
freeze all those assholes</font>

265
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:13,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna make off
with that geisha?</font>

266
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna die.</font>

267
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just
make that up right now?</font>

268
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:47,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn convincing.</font>

269
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to the daimyos.</font>

270
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like they had no idea
what I was saying.</font>

271
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:26,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

272
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:27,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cortical fluid.</font>

273
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:30,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Shogun's not awake.</font>

274
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:32,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's broken.</font>

275
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:27,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fucking wonder the
daimyos didn't hear you.</font>

276
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've gone completely
off the rails here,</font>

277
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this loon is driving
the fucking train.</font>

278
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Train'll be ready
by morning.</font>

279
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:40,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">To go where?</font>

280
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:42,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly where we thought.</font>

281
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:48,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I caught up with the men
who took your father.</font>

282
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.</font>

283
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took a while, but
he gave up their destination.</font>

284
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell them.
- It's the Mesa.</font>

285
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:01,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're goin' home, Teddy.</font>

286
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:05,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Load everything up
on the train.</font>

287
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll leave at first light.</font>

288
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:13,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's find a spot for the night.</font>

289
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:48,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you asked today,
about walking away,</font>

290
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">making it on our own.</font>

291
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:54,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you want me to say yes</font>

292
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if I was only
going to disappoint you?</font>

293
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not some stranger,
Dolores...</font>

294
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:18,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.</font>

295
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:22,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known you
my whole life.</font>

296
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we go...</font>

297
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">we go eyes open...</font>

298
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">together.</font>

299
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:29,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

300
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some things are
too precious to lose...</font>

301
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">even to be free.</font>

302
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:53,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something
I need to show you.</font>

00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">For days now...</font>

304
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:06,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been questioning
my feelings for you.</font>

305
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much is real,</font>

306
00:49:12,211 --> 00:49:15,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much is just some story
I was made to believe.</font>

307
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:33,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">But tonight I know.</font>

308
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all true.</font>

309
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:55,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">They built us
to perform for them</font>

310
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">and for each other.</font>

311
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's over.</font>

312
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:03,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you tonight, Dolores.</font>

313
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you saw me.</font>

314
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:11,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did see you, Teddy.</font>

315
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">These past few days...</font>

316
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:24,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you so clearly.</font>

317
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh.</font>

318
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:35,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've seen
you're not gonna make it.</font>

319
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:41,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh... What is this,
Dolores?</font>

320
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what
I don't want you to become.</font>

321
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:51,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a swarm descending.</font>

322
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like the bluetongue
when I was a girl.</font>

323
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we're gonna survive...</font>

324
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">some of us will have to burn.</font>

325
00:51:28,704 --> 00:51:29,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold him.</font>

326
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:35,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores! Dolores!</font>

327
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:38,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish there was
another way, Teddy.</font>

328
00:51:38,723 --> 00:51:41,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">But where we're about to go, it's
no place for a man like you.</font>

329
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:44,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

330
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:46,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you want this?</font>

331
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">With changes this extreme,</font>

332
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:50,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">without a full reset, it's...</font>

333
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:52,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't guarantee that
he'll hold together.</font>

334
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:54,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">To grow...</font>

335
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:57,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">we all need to suffer.</font>

336
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arigato, Maeve.</font>

337
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:37,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.
What do we do now?</font>

338
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:41,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you
I found a new voice.</font>

339
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we use it.</font>
