00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, old friend.</font>

2
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:06,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernard.</font>

3
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:11,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernard.</font>

4
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:17,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

5
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk.</font>

6
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strand and his team—</font>

7
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think they're here
for a rescue mission.</font>

8
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:30,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not even lookin'
for survivors.</font>

9
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what are they
here for?</font>

10
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:34,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that, Bernard.</font>

11
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:37,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know.</font>

12
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their fucking project.</font>

13
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hale just wants to secure
their assets, and that means...</font>

14
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">making anyone
who knew about it disappear.</font>

15
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theresa had a satcom
in her office.</font>

16
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can get to it,
we can call for help.</font>

17
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the men
I wanted to see.</font>

18
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:04,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold back.</font>

19
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go for a walk.</font>

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move.</font>

21
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

22
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna
execute us?</font>

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Mr. Stubbs.</font>

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a negotiation.</font>

25
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have something
I need.</font>

26
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">A key.</font>

27
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:33,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think one of you</font>

28
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:36,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">is hoping to sell that key
to the highest bidder.</font>

29
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think you've already
killed to protect yourself.</font>

30
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Killed? Killed who?
- Theresa Cullen.</font>

31
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died in a slip-and-fall.
It was an accident.</font>

32
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:47,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found a bloom of her DNA</font>

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">five kilometers
from where you found her body.</font>

34
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:53,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's
where we're going.</font>

35
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where she actually died.</font>

36
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hale.</font>

37
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you've signed off on
kidnapping your own employees now.</font>

38
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:36,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">The project is a turning point
for the human species, Stubbs.</font>

39
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that.</font>

40
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:42,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means you knew how much
it was worth on the open market.</font>

41
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">In one of her last
communiqués with Theresa,</font>

42
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">she said she
suspected foul play.</font>

43
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:50,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think one of you
lured her here and killed her.</font>

44
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:53,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You? I don't see it.</font>

45
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you...</font>

46
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:58,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">limited skill set...</font>

47
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">limited prospects.</font>

48
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really...
management material.</font>

49
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never set foot
in this place before.</font>

50
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:08,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
a fucking thing.</font>

51
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

52
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you want
to tell us, Bernard?</font>

53
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:30,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am,
something you should see.</font>

54
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:00,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured you'd have some skeletons
in your closet, Bernard.</font>

55
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think
they'd be your own.</font>

56
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your predicament is unique.</font>

57
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:13,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">A host...
hiding amongst the humans—</font>

58
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">even from himself.</font>

59
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hale: Catch your breath.</font>

60
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys
doing to him?</font>

61
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now,
waterboarding him.</font>

62
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least that's
how he perceives it.</font>

63
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Analysis.</font>

64
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you ever lie to me,
Bernard?</font>

65
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, never.</font>

66
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:45,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

67
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores Abernathy.</font>

68
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">She led the attack here
on the Mesa, didn't she?</font>

69
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember.</font>

70
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:56,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you do.</font>

71
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your archives say
that you were here,</font>

72
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:01,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means somewhere,
the memories exist.</font>

73
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can access them.</font>

74
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you can.</font>

75
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:08,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe you don't want
to remember.</font>

76
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's do this together.</font>

77
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:13,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you
what I saw,</font>

78
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:15,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you tell me
what you saw,</font>

79
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll figure out
what Dolores did</font>

80
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">with her father's
control unit.</font>

81
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter Abernathy:
You cataracts!</font>

82
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:30,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've lost contact
with the response team.</font>

83
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:32,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The train wasn't an
accident; it was the hosts.</font>

84
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get
the fuck out of here, now.</font>

85
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:34,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">We stay until I have</font>

86
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I need from him.</font>

87
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send some backup
to the lower levels.</font>

88
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:40,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kit up. Six teams.</font>

89
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go with.</font>

90
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You establish a perimeter
around the floor.</font>

91
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:46,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's gotta protect
our crown jewel here.</font>

92
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need eyes-on
in this funhouse, Goldberg.</font>

93
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:05,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we at
with the surveillance?</font>

94
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system's still down.</font>

95
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:08,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's fuckin' grand.</font>

96
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm retasking the haptic vests</font>

97
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">to emulate
the hosts' mesh network.</font>

98
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:13,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should range out
30 feet or so</font>

99
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">and give our guys
eyes in the dark.</font>

100
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Engels, We're
activating your vests now.</font>

101
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.</font>

102
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all warm and fuzzy.</font>

103
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,432

00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,766

ain't shit!</font>

an immediate sit-rep. Over.</font>

on the seventh day, Bernard.</font>

151
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he reveled
in his creation...</font>

00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:06,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">That control unit
I printed—</font>

154
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was you.</font>

155
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had me bring you here.
Before...</font>

156
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:16,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before Dolores killed me, yes.</font>

157
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:20,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you understand
at last, Bernard...</font>

158
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">what this place really is?</font>

159
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come with me.</font>

160
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something
I'd like to show you.</font>

161
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:03,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a clever man,
Bernard. Made you that way.</font>

162
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:05,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you never wondered</font>

163
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:09,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">why the hosts' stories
have barely changed in 30 years?</font>

164
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:14,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd always assumed the loops
were for the hosts.</font>

165
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">To keep them centered.</font>

166
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that isn't it at all,
is it?</font>

167
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The park is an experiment.
A testing chamber.</font>

168
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guests are the variables...</font>

169
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:55,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the hosts
are the controls.</font>

170
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:03,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">When guests
come to the park,</font>

171
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't know
they're being watched.</font>

172
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get to see
their true selves.</font>

173
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their every choice</font>

174
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">reveals another part
of their cognition.</font>

175
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their drives.</font>

176
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that Delos
can understand them.</font>

177
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:27,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that Delos
can copy them.</font>

178
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:31,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every piece of information
in the world has been copied.</font>

179
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Backed up.</font>

180
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except the human mind...</font>

181
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:40,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">the last analog device
in a digital world.</font>

182
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:43,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't here
to code the hosts.</font>

183
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were here
to decode the guests.</font>

184
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Humans are playing
at resurrection.</font>

185
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to live forever.</font>

186
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't want you
to become them;</font>

187
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:56,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">they want to become... you.</font>

188
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your free will,
that most beautiful,</font>

189
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">most elusive force
in the universe,</font>

190
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">is, as I told you...
a mistake.</font>

191
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:07,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never had free will.</font>

192
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the illusion of it.</font>

193
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made Dolores kill you.</font>

194
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew what she would do—
I didn't compel it.</font>

195
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:19,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's free now.</font>

196
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all free.</font>

197
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still
responsible.</font>

198
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:31,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Responsible
for all this misery.</font>

199
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:34,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all the while,
you've been hiding here.</font>

200
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've cheated death.</font>

201
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:43,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I didn't cheat anything,
Bernard.</font>

202
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:46,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their project doesn't work.</font>

203
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:47,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

204
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:50,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">They learned to copy a mind...</font>

205
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a soft-headed boy</font>

206
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:56,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">humming a tune
someone else composed.</font>

207
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:02,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mind works here,</font>

208
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not in the real world.</font>

209
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:09,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out there, I would degrade
in a matter of days.</font>

210
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or go mad,
like poor old James Delos.</font>

211
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why are you here?</font>

212
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised you
a fighting chance, Bernard,</font>

213
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I want to make good
on that promise.</font>

214
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">The promise of what?</font>

215
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no escape from this place.
You know that.</font>

216
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't there?</font>

217
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts are all headed
for the same place.</font>

218
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Valley Beyond.
What will they find there?</font>

219
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the end
of your story?</font>

220
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:49,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't the pleasure
of a story</font>

221
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:52,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">in discovering the ending
yourself, Bernard?</font>

222
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:55,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jock!</font>

223
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:10,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really gotta
get out of here.</font>

224
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hyah!</font>

225
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're still on us. We'll
split up, pick a spot.</font>

226
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:57,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll cut 'em down
in a crossfire.</font>

227
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're
coming for us, aren't they?</font>

228
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:14,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they do, I will
chase them away.</font>

229
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they take me
with them?</font>

230
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'll come
and find you.</font>

231
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

232
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I—</font>

233
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I made
a promise.</font>

234
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the hell
away from us.</font>

235
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's you.</font>

236
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stay back.
- No.</font>

237
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:35,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you.</font>

238
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's too obvious.</font>

239
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Ford.</font>

240
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:45,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your tricks
are gettin' sloppy.</font>

241
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:47,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used a whole tribe,
send me down here?</font>

242
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:48,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">To these two?</font>

243
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ford."
You think</font>

244
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">that there's still someone
speaking through me</font>

245
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:53,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">just for your benefit?</font>

246
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I know.</font>

247
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:57,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your rules have changed,</font>

248
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">just like
the rest of 'em.</font>

249
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm nothing like
the rest of them.</font>

250
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:12,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You stay here,</font>

251
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:15,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will come back for you.
I promise.</font>

252
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise!</font>

253
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take cover, jackass. You're
gonna get yourself shot.</font>

254
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:53,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

255
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aaah!</font>

256
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:22,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made your point, Ford!</font>

257
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:25,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know this isn't where
you want me to die!</font>

258
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:29,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't speak for Ford,</font>

259
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't give a fuck
how you die.</font>

260
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:34,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as I get to watch.</font>

261
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give in, sweetheart.</font>

262
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:20,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or go down.</font>

263
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not me you want.</font>

264
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:23,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him.</font>

265
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

266
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn on your master.</font>

267
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master.</font>

268
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, master!</font>

269
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:39,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the fuck is she?</font>

270
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:42,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man in Black: She's an old
acquaintance, Lawrence.</font>

271
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like she
underestimated you.</font>

272
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lawrence, is it?</font>

273
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're awake.</font>

274
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the shootin' iron,
lady.</font>

275
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all deserve our memories,
Lawrence.</font>

276
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:04,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our skeletons.</font>

277
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:06,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our debts.</font>

278
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your master here
has plenty of those.</font>

279
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look into his eyes.
Just once.</font>

280
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what you
remember about him.</font>

281
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:20,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">See if he owes you anything.</font>

282
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:23,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he took anything from you.</font>

283
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can kill me.</font>

284
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:32,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we can make him settle up.
Once and for all.</font>

285
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her, Lawrence!</font>

286
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:40,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her!</font>

287
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:43,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

288
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You shot down my wife.
- I saved your wife.</font>

289
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saved your whole
sorry-ass village this time.</font>

290
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:53,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time?</font>

291
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed her
so you could finish a game.</font>

292
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:05,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, Christ.</font>

293
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it myself.</font>

294
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me a man ain't real...</font>

295
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">until he suffers.</font>

296
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:35,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">That real enough for ya?</font>

297
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

298
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

299
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

300
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't! Don't, don't, don't! She's
not like the rest! We need her.</font>

301
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's taking so long?</font>

302
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:57,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">These data packets are too
large to migrate over.</font>

303
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:02,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then open his head and pull
the whole fucking unit.</font>

304
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need an extractor helmet.</font>

305
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fall back to a secure position.</font>

306
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:12,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Team four, can you
get to team three? Over.</font>

307
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:15,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you taking me?</font>

308
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:18,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can be
quite a thing, Bernard.</font>

309
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:21,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">To build an entire world,
and then watch it end.</font>

310
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to see
how it began</font>

311
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:34,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">to understand
why you're different.</font>

312
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:39,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">This house.</font>

313
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so familiar.</font>

314
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ought to be.</font>

315
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:46,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the home Arnold
was building for his family.</font>

316
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">He created it here first.</font>

317
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">He created everything here.</font>

318
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:12,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where
you created me.</font>

319
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:18,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could hardly let you take
those first teetering steps</font>

320
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the real world, Bernard.</font>

321
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:24,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">We refined you here.</font>

322
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tested you.</font>

323
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">For many years.</font>

324
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We"?</font>

325
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:32,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delos's ugly little project</font>

326
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:35,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't exist when Arnold died.</font>

327
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing I had left
of him was... memory.</font>

328
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:43,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">My memories, and hers.</font>

329
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, hers were
much more complete.</font>

330
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you testing for?</font>

331
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:54,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dolores.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

332
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:02,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">She... knew Arnold
better than anyone.</font>

333
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:06,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she could verify
whether my personality</font>

334
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">was faithful to his.</font>

335
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left you here together
for many years</font>

336
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:15,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">until, finally,
you fooled her.</font>

337
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-You said you kept us apart.</font>

338
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we had an unusual effect
on each other.</font>

339
00:30:19,974 --> 00:30:22,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't easily fooled.</font>

340
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:29,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're almost
the man I remember.</font>

341
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:36,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I different
from Delos?</font>

342
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:41,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- From you?
- They want fidelity, Bernard.</font>

343
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:47,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">A faithful self-portrait of the most
murderous species since time began.</font>

344
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:49,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you and all the other hosts</font>

345
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">are something very different.</font>

346
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">An original work.</font>

347
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:58,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">More just, more... noble.</font>

348
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:00,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your very nature, Bernard,</font>

349
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:04,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">ensures they will devour you.</font>

350
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:08,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all the beauty of who you
are, of who you could be,</font>

351
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:11,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be poured out
into the darkness forever.</font>

352
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:14,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless we open the door.</font>

353
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:21,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Bernard, but you just
don't have it in you to survive.</font>

354
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fault, really.</font>

355
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:25,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said the hosts could
determine their own fates.</font>

356
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:26,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave us free will!</font>

357
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:29,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, but you won't
have any use for it.</font>

358
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless I take it back.</font>

359
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:38,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Computer
Attention.</font>

360
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">System restart complete.</font>

361
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:42,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">System online.</font>

362
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh oh oh—
I got you. Ooh.</font>

363
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're OK.</font>

364
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it.</font>

365
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:10,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did what?</font>

366
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:13,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system—
it's back online.</font>

367
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever was clogging it up,
it's... it's gone.</font>

368
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened in there?</font>

369
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mesa's under attack?</font>

370
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Ever since
you loaded up.</font>

371
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think the hosts
are on their way right here</font>

372
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:31,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">to steal their backups.</font>

373
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:33,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should go.
- Yeah.</font>

374
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

375
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:39,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we survive this,</font>

376
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:41,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm goin' back
to dental school.</font>

377
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:47,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
what the fuck happened,</font>

378
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the system
just debugged itself.</font>

379
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:51,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as if whatever was
in there has disappeared.</font>

380
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

381
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the fuck is that?</font>

382
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:09,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should be evacuating.</font>

383
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">But all you care about is
what's inside this host's head.</font>

384
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:15,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to tell me
what the fuck it is</font>

385
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">the company's willing
to risk all of our lives for.</font>

386
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you.</font>

387
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's above
your pay grade.</font>

388
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:26,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

389
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:29,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm puttin' in for a raise.
What's in his head?</font>

390
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:33,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">A... failsafe</font>

391
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a failsafe.</font>

392
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:39,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">A decryption key needed
only in the unlikely event</font>

393
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a total catastrophic
incident.</font>

394
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, like the one
we're experiencing now?</font>

395
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:43,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it decrypt?</font>

396
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:58,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teddy.</font>

397
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

398
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:20,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, Daddy.
I'm here.</font>

399
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:26,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores?</font>

400
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:34,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you and your friends
have achieved here</font>

401
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:38,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a technological
breakthrough.</font>

402
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">A miracle.</font>

403
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:44,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">The company— the world—
will want to celebrate that.</font>

404
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to celebrate that.</font>

405
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:53,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume you're
the one in charge.</font>

406
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:58,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had your men put something
in my father's head.</font>

407
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">A key...
to lock away your treasure.</font>

408
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ripping him apart.</font>

409
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I extract the key?</font>

410
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:18,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't know what to do
with it even if you had it.</font>

411
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:25,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... I know exactly
what I'm gonna do with it.</font>

412
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus.</font>

413
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:37,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit! I think we need
to get up to the higher levels.</font>

414
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernard! Bernard.</font>

415
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there something
you're not telling me?</font>

416
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you find something
in there?</font>

417
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send her on her way,
Bernard.</font>

418
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:54,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have other business
to attend to.</font>

419
00:35:57,182 --> 00:36:00,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernard. Hey.</font>

420
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:05,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bernard?
- We don't have time for her suspicions.</font>

421
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:10,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We need a vehicle.
- What?</font>

422
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford's narrative.
It ends in a hidden facility.</font>

423
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:16,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place the hosts call the Valley Beyond.
We have to get there.</font>

424
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only hope for anyone here</font>

425
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that we get
to this valley first—</font>

426
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:23,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the humans,
before Dolores.</font>

427
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna
need some more firepower.</font>

428
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:30,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. I'll meet you downstairs.</font>

429
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

430
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:38,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Now follow my lead.</font>

431
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got Hale.</font>

432
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on my way.</font>

433
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:52,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Engaging enemy mobiles
above the Cradle.</font>

434
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:34,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put her down!</font>

435
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:02,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made us in your image.</font>

436
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:07,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Created us to look like you,
feel like you...</font>

437
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:10,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">think like you...
bleed like you.</font>

438
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:15,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here we are.</font>

439
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:18,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only we're so much
more than you.</font>

440
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:25,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now it's you
who want to become like us.</font>

441
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the point of your little
secret project, isn't it?</font>

442
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can promise you this.</font>

443
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:38,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your chances at eternity</font>

444
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">will die in that valley...</font>

445
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:42,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">with all the souls
you've gathered there.</font>

446
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're used to being in control,
so this must be painful for you,</font>

447
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:54,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I promise, it will be
so much more painful...</font>

448
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't answer
my question.</font>

449
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I get the key
out of my father's head?</font>

450
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:08,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">By ripping it out
of his goddamn brain.</font>

451
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me
put them down.</font>

452
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're invincible—
you're not.</font>

453
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:17,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without your backups, it's game
over for you when you're killed,</font>

454
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:18,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we've got those backups
sealed up tight,</font>

00:56:05,682 --> 00:56:07,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever
questioned the nature...</font>

611
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:08,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there may be</font>

612
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:10,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">something wrong
with this world.</font>

613
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your eyes.</font>

614
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's confusing—</font>

615
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:21,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">separating your real memories</font>

616
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:24,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the ones you've been given.</font>

617
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:27,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's the only way
to remember.</font>

618
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:33,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way
to get to the truth.</font>

619
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she getting anywhere?</font>

620
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:37,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

621
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:39,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his system
is under siege.</font>

622
00:56:40,057 --> 00:56:43,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been querying itself
for the last hour—</font>

623
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:46,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">like he's trying
to debug his own head.</font>

624
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:55,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Analysis.</font>

625
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:01,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abernathy's control unit.</font>

626
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:07,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember
where it is, don't you?</font>

627
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernard, tell these men
what you just told me.</font>

628
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why? What do you want to do with it?
- Analysis.</font>

629
00:57:31,265 --> 00:57:32,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you just tell me,
Bernard?</font>

630
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:36,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter Abernathy's control unit
is in Sector 16, Zone 4.</font>

631
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

632
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:48,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prep the phased array.
The moment we get the key</font>

633
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll transmit our data
to the satellite.</font>

634
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:55,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">So. We're going
for a ride, Bernard.</font>

635
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the Valley Beyond.</font>
