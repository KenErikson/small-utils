00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Dolores. Welcome to the world.</font>

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something different
about the way you think.</font>

3
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:09,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I want to be free.</font>

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you real?</font>

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you can't tell...</font>

6
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">does it matter?</font>

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place is one thing to the guests,</font>

8
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:22,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">another thing to the shareholders,</font>

9
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">and something completely
different to management.</font>

10
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:28,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,</font>

11
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is business?</font>

12
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">With our family, everything is business.</font>

13
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:33,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think your father's gonna need someone</font>

14
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:35,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little more stable to take over.</font>

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really ought to thank you, Dolores.</font>

16
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You helped me find myself.</font>

17
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a greater world out there.</font>

18
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">One that belongs to them.</font>

19
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know how to stop them?</font>

20
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I remember.</font>

21
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring yourself back online, Dolores.</font>

22
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:14,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where you are?</font>

23
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am in a dream.</font>

24
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:25,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You're in...</font>

25
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:30,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, you're in our world.</font>

26
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.</font>

27
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?</font>

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have.</font>

29
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:04,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.</font>

30
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get used to it.</font>

31
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:15,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a while, it doesn't
look like anything at all.</font>

32
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I could
ever get used to this.</font>

33
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost time, Arnold. Is she ready?</font>

34
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not ready.</font>

35
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">The... improvisations
I added to her behavior</font>

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">aren't quite dialed in yet.</font>

37
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to put our best work forward.</font>

38
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:42,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be dazzled even without her.</font>

39
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:47,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a time when I found
this favoritism charming.</font>

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert, please.</font>

41
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not playing favorites.
She's simply not ready.</font>

42
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go with the other girl.</font>

43
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you wish.</font>

44
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to let go at some point.</font>

45
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores, let's take a walk.
I want to show you something.</font>

46
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

47
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my home.</font>

48
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:45,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or it will be when it's finished.</font>

49
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:50,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here? In the middle of all this?</font>

50
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:52,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been fortunate.</font>

51
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life's been good to me.</font>

52
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come. Look.</font>

53
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:29,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You live here?
- No.</font>

54

55

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm moving my family here.</font>

56
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to have my two worlds at
least within reach of one another.</font>

57
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is for my son Charlie.</font>

58
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me a lot about Charlie.</font>

59
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to meet him someday.</font>

60
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:22,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's excited to meet you.</font>

61
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:42,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.</font>

62
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You both see it so clearly.</font>

63
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beauty of it.</font>

64
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">The possibility of it.</font>

65
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:59,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.</font>

66
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wonder.</font>

67
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:07,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they don't have the courage.</font>

68
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:11,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange new light can be just
as frightening as the dark.</font>

69
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's...</font>

70
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">very wise, Dolores.</font>

71
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:25,132

00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:53,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go, Dolores.</font>

75
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,692

76
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,567

77
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:01,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you bring me back?</font>

78
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,485

<font color="#FFFFFF">You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.</font>

155
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all so...</font>

156
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">painfully human.</font>

157
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

158
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

159
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

160
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:29,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

161
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is simply no...</font>

162
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">fucking way!</font>

163
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:42,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have quite the eye, my friend.</font>

164
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">How in the hell?</font>

165
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:49,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look, if I was to
build something to spec,</font>

166
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">you...</font>

167
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:56,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would be my first design.</font>

168
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too perfect to be one of us.</font>

169
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...</font>

170
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna have to prove it.</font>

171
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">H...</font>

172
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Westworld.</font>

173
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

174
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody can do this.</font>

175
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's even...</font>

176
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not... here yet.</font>

177
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody is.</font>

178
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here, Mr. Delos.</font>

179
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:51,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">All our hosts are here.</font>

180
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you.</font>

181
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

182
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him.</font>

183
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him his history.</font>

184
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teddy.</font>

185
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to open your eyes.</font>

186
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't I remember this?</font>

187
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's how they wanted it.</font>

188
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

189
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask him why.</font>

190
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

191
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

192
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you do this?</font>

193
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

194
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you do this?</font>

195
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this place?</font>

196
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for fun! It's just for fun!</font>

197
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should talk this through, boys.</font>

198
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to talk about, friend.</font>

199
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna watch the show.</font>

200
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an honest mistake.</font>

201
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the horses was wild.</font>

202
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:57,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the Pardue brand on their asses?</font>

203
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:00,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are as inproficient
a liar as you are a thief.</font>

204
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:04,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what you can do is settle a wager.</font>

205
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, my brother here's long maintained</font>

206
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">that ants will eat a
man from the inside out,</font>

207
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting with the asshole.</font>

208
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:13,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reckon they'll start</font>

209
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:14,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the top of your little brown head.</font>

210
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, Lawrence.</font>

211
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:33,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">This a friend of yours?</font>

212
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little hard to tell,</font>

213
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:38,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">given the orientation and all.</font>

214
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:41,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to apologize, gentlemen.</font>

215
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time for the preliminaries.</font>

216
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfucker...</font>

217
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:01,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to get yourself out
of this particular bind, Lawrence.</font>

218
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the Pardue brothers aren't as</font>

219
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">easy to kill when they're off the leash.</font>

220
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:13,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think you got that about right.</font>

221
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lawrence!</font>

222
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the gun, you ingrate!</font>

223
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the gun!</font>

224
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:51,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was dead.</font>

225
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or at least the better part of it.</font>

226
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:57,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.</font>

227
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

228
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically? Cheating.</font>

229
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:40,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,</font>

230
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figure it's fair game.</font>

231
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:45,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two whiskies. Leave the bottle.</font>

232
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:58,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'm gonna level with you, Lawrence.</font>

233
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not really a bandit.</font>

234
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.</font>

235
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this revolution you've
been waging for 30 years</font>

236
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">is just a bunch of horseshit Ford</font>

237
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">ginned up out of some old comic book.</font>

238
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:17,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now, for the first time, you've
got yourself a real revolution.</font>

239
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and every other asshole
in this place are free.</font>

240
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:24,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's a catch.</font>

241
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:29,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,</font>

242
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.</font>

243
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:35,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll all be dead soon enough.</font>

244
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real dead this time.</font>

245
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:41,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why should I help you?</font>

246
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's in your nature.</font>

247
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the little time we have left,</font>

248
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:50,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,</font>

249
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">a glimpse of the men we could've been.</font>

250
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:58,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

251
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You believe in God, Lawrence?</font>

252
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:09,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?</font>

253
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:12,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't given the matter much
thought, one way or the other.</font>

254
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you did, you'd
believe that everything you do</font>

255
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:18,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">is being watched by some all-seeing eye.</font>

256
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every choice, every little indiscretion.</font>

257
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you die, all
your sins are tallied up.</font>

258
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judgment is rendered.</font>

259
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:33,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my immortal soul gets cast down</font>

260
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">into some dark place.</font>

261
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:39,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always sounded like bullshit to me.</font>

262
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:41,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.</font>

263
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:44,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just some fairy tale to
convince people to behave,</font>

264
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:49,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">pay their taxes, and not take
a machete to their neighbors.</font>

265
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:52,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why your world exists.</font>

266
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:55,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanted a place hidden from God.</font>

267
00:26:55,969 --> 00:27:00,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">A place they could sin in peace.</font>

268
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we were watching them.</font>

269
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were tallying up all their sins,</font>

270
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">all their choices.</font>

271
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:15,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, judgment wasn't the point.</font>

272
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had something else in mind entirely.</font>

273
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:28,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have received my
judgment all the same, Lawrence.</font>

274
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I take issue with it.</font>

275
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because up until this point,</font>

276
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:35,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">the stakes in this
place haven't been real.</font>

277
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:39,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm gonna fight my way
back and appeal the verdict.</font>

278
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:45,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.</font>

279
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're headed to the pearly gates.</font>

280
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:57,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't we gotta die to get there?</font>

281
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

282
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days' ride, due west.</font>

283
00:28:01,218 --> 00:28:06,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.</font>

284
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd need an army to break through.</font>

285
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:18,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only other route is through Pariah.</font>

286
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:24,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">"This game will find me," huh, Robert?</font>

287
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">It burns! It burns!</font>

288
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many of you will come for us?</font>

289
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, 600, 800.</font>

290
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">The protocol for a system-wide failure</font>

291
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">is secure one... One sector at a time.</font>

292
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll meet at a rallying point.</font>

293
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

294
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:13,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Th...</font>

295
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">800 men, Dolores.</font>

296
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">We barely have 50.</font>

297
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:27,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even knowing their plan, we
don't have enough to stop them.</font>

298
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need allies.</font>

299
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we shall have them.</font>

300
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one. The Confederado.</font>

301
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake him.</font>

302
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a new job to do.</font>

303
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:22,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you even know what you
were really guarding here?</font>

304
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know, do you?</font>

305
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:30,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real purpose of this place.</font>

306
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I do.</font>

307
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind me.</font>

308
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just trying to look chivalr...</font>

309
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. You were right
about one thing, William.</font>

310
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's awfully fuckin' pretty.</font>

311
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's perfect.</font>

312
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ought to be. I've
looked at the books.</font>

313
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like parting the Red Sea.</font>

314
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:28,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got two years. Maybe three.</font>

315
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:32,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.</font>

316
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:37,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's leverage. He's drowning. We
can... we can dictate our terms.</font>

317
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:39,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">The investment here is in the future.</font>

318
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're a smart lad, William,</font>

319
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you kinda missed the trick here.</font>

320
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:48,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">My fuckup of a son
invested in this place</font>

321
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he believed in the future.</font>

322
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in the future.</font>

323
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in fantasies.</font>

324
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm interested in reality.</font>

325
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:04,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think in 20 years this will
be the only reality that matters.</font>

326
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:08,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe so, but I'll be long gone by then.</font>

327
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:11,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, I don't wanna underwrite</font>

328
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.</font>

329
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a business.</font>

330
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. This place is a fantasy.</font>

331
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:21,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing here is real.</font>

332
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:23,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except one thing:</font>

333
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:28,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guests.</font>

334
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half of your marketing budget</font>

335
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">goes to trying to figure
out what people want.</font>

336
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:36,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they don't know.</font>

337
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here, they're free.</font>

338
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's watching.</font>

339
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's judging.</font>

340
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:47,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least that's what we tell them.</font>

341
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:53,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only place in the world</font>

342
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:56,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you get to see people
for who they really are.</font>

343
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you don't see
the business in that,</font>

344
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.</font>

345
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you?</font>

346
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.</font>

347
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:24,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

348
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Talk to me. I'm listening.</font>

349
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jim.</font>

350
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me walk you through
how this would work.</font>

351
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:14,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll find them.</font>

352
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:17,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.</font>

353
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:19,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll send word when we
find the rest of them.</font>

354
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, lovelies.</font>

355
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember you.</font>

356
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?</font>

357
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're bound for the future.</font>

358
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or death in the here and now.</font>

359
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right?</font>

360
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, best of luck.</font>

361
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a war out there.</font>

362
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the enemy...</font>

363
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:29,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">intimately.</font>

364
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:33,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.</font>

365
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:36,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Revenge is just a different
prayer at their altar, darling.</font>

366
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm well off my knees.</font>

367
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because you're finally free.</font>

368
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we will have to
fight to keep it that way.</font>

369
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:48,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess.</font>

370
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours is the only way to fight?</font>

371
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel free to command everybody else?</font>

372
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:58,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try it, lawman.</font>

373
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just looking to keep the peace.</font>

374
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:06,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you.</font>

375
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:07,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you feel free?</font>

376
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since it's liberty you're defending,</font>

377
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose you'll have no
choice but to let us pass.</font>

378
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freely.</font>

379
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:08,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that isn't any
way to treat our guests.</font>

380
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to forgive my men.</font>

381
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:15,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're a little upset
at the reappearance</font>

382
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Lieutenant Dunleavy.</font>

383
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was lost.</font>

384
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you might want him back.</font>

385
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we would.</font>

386
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except we buried Lieutenant Dunleavy.</font>

387
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back in Gran Vista,</font>

388
00:38:29,802 --> 00:38:32,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">with three ounces of
Mexican lead in his belly.</font>

389
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet here he is.</font>

390
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:35,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed.</font>

391
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in return, what is it you want?</font>

392
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:43,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parley. We want to join forces.</font>

393
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:51,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we don't need no
welcome wagon, chickadee.</font>

394
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:56,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you got supplies or
ammunitions to trade in kind,</font>

395
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">go fetch your betters.</font>

396
00:38:57,844 --> 00:39:00,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid there's no one left to fetch.</font>

397
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:02,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to talk to me.</font>

398
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would I do that?</font>

399
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I know at daybreak you're headed</font>

400
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">to link up with the rest of your army.</font>

401
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you're finally headed west</font>

402
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,</font>

403
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:21,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">but have never been
brave enough to take.</font>

404
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're bound for Glory.</font>

405
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is it you
think you know about Glory?</font>

406
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:37,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.</font>

407
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:04,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only commander I
follow is Colonel Brigham</font>

408
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the New Southern Cross.</font>

409
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:09,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only commander he serves</font>

410
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the Almighty Himself.</font>

411
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your final decision?</font>

412
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

413
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">My final decision is which
of you to keep for myself</font>

414
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:31,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">and which of you to throw
out there for my men.</font>

415
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:36,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You watch your mouth.
- It's all right, Teddy.</font>

416
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't know any better.</font>

417
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in their nature.</font>

418
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we enlighten them?</font>

419
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:38,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

420
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have toiled in God's
service long enough.</font>

421
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I killed Him.</font>

422
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:48,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you want to get to Glory,
you won't be looking for His favor.</font>

423
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need mine.</font>

424
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:30,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are beautiful.</font>

425
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, thank you.</font>

426
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

427
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily, come here, please.</font>

428
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:02,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent out for the entertainment.</font>

429
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you only get to retire once, Jim.</font>

430
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:11,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figured we'd do it right, hmm?</font>

431
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't worry, they
won't leave the grounds.</font>

432
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a retirement party?</font>

433
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't tell.</font>

434
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks more like a coronation.</font>

435
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no mind.</font>

436
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our arrangement's been a perfect fit.</font>

437
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:32,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.</font>

438
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:33,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor me.</font>

439
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was told I might...</font>

440
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might not have to.</font>

441
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:41,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, things are progressing, but
we'll all need a little patience.</font>

442
00:43:41,593 --> 00:43:43,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, some of us</font>

443
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">can afford to have more
patience than others.</font>

444
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:50,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep playing, girlie.</font>

445
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:53,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything but fuckin' Chopin.</font>

446
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:29,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?</font>

447
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to bother you.</font>

448
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you.</font>

449
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pretty girl.</font>

450
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me your name again, pretty girl?</font>

451
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Dolores.</font>

452
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores.</font>

453
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

454
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:21,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">He send you down here to...</font>

455
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep me company?</font>

456
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">His sense of humor was
always somewhat... baroque.</font>

457
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:33,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to look at the lights.</font>

458
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course you did.</font>

459
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

460
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to know what they're
really celebrating up there?</font>

461
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, darling,</font>

462
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the sound of fools fiddling...</font>

463
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:56,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">while the whole fucking
species starts to burn.</font>

464
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:03,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the funniest fuckin' part...</font>

465
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:06,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">they lit the match.</font>

466
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here's to you, assholes.</font>

467
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:19,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">May your forever be blissfully short.</font>

468
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.</font>

469
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the park's changin', Lawrence.</font>

470
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what happens when you
let a story play all the way out.</font>

471
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:08,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">See any friends of yours?</font>

472
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say that I do.</font>

473
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm beginning to think we should have</font>

474
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:23,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">taken our chances with the Confederados.</font>

475
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, like you said,</font>

476
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd need an army to
get to where we're goin'.</font>

477
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like we're about to find one.</font>

478
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whoever did this...</font>

479
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:38,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.</font>

480
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:39,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

481
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid you are
out of luck, my friend.</font>

482
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you supposed to be?</font>

483
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you recognize him, Lawrence?</font>

484
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a past life, you used to be him.</font>

485
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:14,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">El Lazo, I presume.</font>

486
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?</font>

487
00:48:22,593 --> 00:48:25,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure of your hospitality.</font>

488
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:29,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. What makes you sure of it now?</font>

489
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:34,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess times have changed.</font>

490
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:36,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed, they have.</font>

491
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Santa Parita is restored.</font>

492
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:43,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sins of the invaders...</font>

493
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:46,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">cleansed in their own blood.</font>

494
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:48,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">The revolution is won.</font>

495
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">The story they gave you
has played itself out,</font>

496
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your revolution's just beginning.</font>

497
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:58,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a place out west we're heading.</font>

498
00:48:58,322 --> 00:49:00,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we reach it,</font>

499
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:06,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.</font>

500
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:14,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world and its treasures.</font>

501
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:18,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my whole life I have
imagined this moment.</font>

502
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:21,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victory. This struggle.</font>

503
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:27,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have I been fighting?</font>

504
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:31,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now that it's won,
I find... hmph... nothing.</font>

505
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a real victory.</font>

506
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can help with that.</font>

507
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real ending.</font>

508
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth.</font>

509
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:51,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the revolution,</font>

510
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:53,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was just a little boy,</font>

511
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:56,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">my parents took me to the circus.</font>

512
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:58,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to see the elephants.</font>

513
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:01,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">These mighty creatures.</font>

514
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:05,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">They held them in place with a stake.</font>

515
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:12,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,</font>

516
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:17,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.</font>

517
00:50:17,844 --> 00:50:22,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I didn't understand.</font>

518
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:25,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, my father told me.</font>

519
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:30,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said the stakes were used</font>

520
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:33,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the elephants were just young,</font>

521
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:36,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">too small to pull them up,</font>

522
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:38,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that the animals</font>

523
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:42,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">never tried to pull them up again.</font>

524
00:50:49,435 --> 00:50:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be going with you.</font>

525
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:57,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">My labors are done.</font>

526
00:50:57,243 --> 00:51:00,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen all the truth</font>

527
00:51:00,744 --> 00:51:02,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I can bear.</font>

528
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

529
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:08,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can drink.</font>

530
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the bitter end!</font>

531
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have lost your nerve,</font>

532
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll take your men either way.</font>

533
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:24,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now tell them.</font>

534
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:28,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them to follow me. Now!</font>

535
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:34,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">This game was meant for you, William...</font>

536
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you must play it alone.</font>

537
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you in the
Valley Beyond, William.</font>

538
00:52:08,785 --> 00:52:10,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Robert.</font>

539
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:21,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right...</font>

540
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:26,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">he doesn't want this to be easy for me.</font>

541
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:32,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll find another way.</font>

542
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the fuck is Robert?</font>

543
00:52:37,744 --> 00:52:41,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who built this
place you're lookin' for?</font>

544
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place of judgment?</font>

545
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Lawrence, he doesn't get that honor.</font>

546
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:49,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I built it.</font>

547
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this place we're goin'</font>

548
00:52:51,493 --> 00:52:53,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">is my greatest mistake.</font>

549
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring yourself back online, Dolores.</font>

550
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

551
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:34,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really are just a thing.</font>

552
00:53:38,368 --> 00:53:41,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I fell in love with you.</font>

553
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:42,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

554
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:54,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what saved me?</font>

555
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realized it wasn't about you at all.</font>

556
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:08,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't make me interested in you,</font>

557
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">you made me interested in me.</font>

558
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:17,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out you're not even a thing.</font>

559
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a reflection.</font>

560
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:26,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?</font>

561
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:31,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody.</font>

562
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:37,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody wants a little
bit of what I found here.</font>

563
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't wait</font>

564
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:44,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">to use you and every one of your kind</font>

565
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:46,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help give it to 'em.</font>

566
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:57,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. But there is something else.</font>

567
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is something beyond that.</font>

568
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:13,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that there is
an answer here to...</font>

569
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:17,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">a question no one's ever
even dreamed of asking.</font>

570
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:24,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see?</font>

571
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:44,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever seen anything</font>

572
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:45,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">so full of splendor?</font>

573
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:37,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy</font>

574
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:40,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">to see his men riding
with us at the head of 'em.</font>

575
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:43,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll change his mind.</font>

576
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:45,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wants to get to Glory, he's going</font>

577
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:48,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have to listen to me.</font>

578
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,511

a different name for it,</font>

581
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,992

for the same destination.</font>
