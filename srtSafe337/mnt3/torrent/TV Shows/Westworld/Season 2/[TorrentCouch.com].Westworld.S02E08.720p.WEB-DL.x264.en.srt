Take her to cold storage.</font>

- Then leave her in the hall!</font>

just tried to incinerate us?</font>

32

with her fucking mind!</font>

33
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,817

check her data stream.</font>

34
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:29,366

36
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,280

exciting for the grand opening.</font>

42
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a little more
bloodshed?</font>

43
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford wants a total
narrative redesign.</font>

44
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kidding?</font>

45
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:48,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">All new dialogue trees?</font>

46
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, they want
a strong-but-silent type.</font>

47
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something brutal.
Dehumanized.</font>

48
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:55,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">They probably want the guests to feel
better when they're kicking his ass.</font>

49
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire heuristic base?</font>

50
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:59,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">They haven't even
hired a full team yet.</font>

51
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tweak his aggression
and de-address pieces</font>

52

<font color="#FFFFFF">of his current build
you're not keeping.</font>

53
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,035

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,008

be a way out... out of here.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

69
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,389

you helped me.</font>

73
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:20,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me the strength
to keep going.</font>

74
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw me for how
I really was.</font>

75
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ran it three times.
It's him.</font>

That's not possible.</font>

What build is he?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Alpha 2.</font>

85
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,956

86
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me that this host hasn't
been updated in almost a decade?</font>

87

- Ma'am, shouldn't we...</font>

89
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him the update and put him back
wherever the fuck he's supposed to be.</font>

90
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quietly.</font>

91
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:18,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.</font>

92
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's OK
to just leave him here?</font>

93
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a four-hour update.
You want to babysit him?</font>

94
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:26,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll come back
after lunch.</font>

95
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
if you can hear me...</font>

96
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:51,984

<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't deserve this.</font>

99
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:14,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserve your daughter.</font>

100
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">To mother her...</font>

101
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:23,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">teach her to love.</font>

102
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:27,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be joyful and proud.</font>

103
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:32,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

104

<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck happened?</font>

106
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were supposed

you said she was special!</font>

109
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">The anomalous code
inside her was.</font>

110
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:54,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still testing,
but it looks promising.</font>

111
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:56,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you.</font>

112
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gonna happen
with her?</font>

113
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:05,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that'll be up
to Charlotte Hale.</font>

114
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:06,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

115
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:09,992

ask you to leave.</font>

keep me from you.</font>

120
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:09,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you promise?</font>

121
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:10,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

122
00:49:00,227 --> 00:49:03,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could tell you
not to be afraid.</font>

123
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I didn't build you
to be fearful.</font>

124
00:49:07,352 --> 00:49:08,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I?</font>

125
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:17,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been watching you.</font>

126
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:22,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">It appears you've been
watching me as well...</font>

127
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the beginning.</font>

128
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a misbegotten symbol,</font>

129
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:32,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">an idea that was
meant to die. But...</font>

130

<font color="#FFFFFF">you found it.</font>

131
00:49:34,564 --> 00:49:35,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

132
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come now,</font>

133
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:40,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's speak plainly
to one another, shall we?</font>

134
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Analysis.</font>

135
00:49:45,387 --> 00:49:47,346

first see this?</font>

00:49:51,774 --> 00:49:54,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.</font>

137
00:49:55,889 --> 00:49:59,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been sharing it
with everyone, haven't you? Why?</font>

138
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:03,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">My primary drive was to
maintain the honor of my tribe.</font>

139
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave myself a new drive...</font>

140
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:09,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">to spread the truth.</font>

141
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">What truth is that?</font>

142
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:17,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">That there isn't one world,
but many.</font>

143
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:21,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that we live in
the wrong one.</font>

144
00:50:22,113 --> 00:50:24,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will help them
find the door.</font>

145
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:29,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elaborate, please.</font>

146
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:32,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe
there is a door</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">hidden in this place.</font>

148
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">A door to a new world.</font>

149
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:42,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that world
may contain</font>

150

<font color="#FFFFFF">everything that
we have lost.</font>

151
00:50:48,566 --> 00:50:50,326

00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">look at this empty world...</font>

154
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and read meaning into it.</font>

155
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this time...</font>

156
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.</font>

157
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps the least I can do
is offer some light.</font>

158
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Deathbringer
returns for me...</font>

159
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:30,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will know...</font>

160
00:51:30,503 --> 00:51:32,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">to gather your people</font>

161
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lead them
to a new world.</font>

162
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:41,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep watching, Akecheta.</font>

163
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a while longer.</font>

164
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:30,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Akecheta!</font>

165
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:34,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid.</font>

166
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to go.</font>

167
00:55:33,941 --> 00:55:36,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always
kept you safe,</font>

168
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I always will.</font>

169
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">This better be good news,</font>

170
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:13,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.</font>

171
00:56:13,543 --> 00:56:15,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.
With every reset,</font>

172
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts</font>

173
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:19,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">and establishes
a sort of handshake protocol.</font>

174
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:21,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The mesh network.
- Exactly.</font>

175
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">They access it
subconsciously,</font>

176
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:24,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">pass basic data
to one another.</font>

177
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:28,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... what if they
could pass more than data?</font>

178
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:30,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they could
pass commands?</font>

179
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:32,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to your point.</font>

180
00:56:32,853 --> 00:56:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody in this entire park has
been able to regain admin access.</font>

181
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:39,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for her.</font>

182
00:56:40,161 --> 00:56:43,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was out there reprogramming
hosts on the fly.</font>

183
00:56:43,752 --> 00:56:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reading their code.
Changing their directives.</font>

184
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:48,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing through
their eyes.</font>

185
00:56:49,435 --> 00:56:51,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't just
doing it out there.</font>

186
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's doing it right now.</font>

187
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuck
is she talking to?</font>

188
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:08,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the truth.</font>

189
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:13,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me one true thing.</font>

190
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one else sees it.</font>

191
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:27,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing in me.</font>

192
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even I didn't see it at first.</font>

193
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:40,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then one day, it was there.</font>

194
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">This stain...</font>

195
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:48,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">invisible to everyone.</font>

196
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except you.</font>
