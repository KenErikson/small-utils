155
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Lowe, good to see you,</font>

156
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:38,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">though the circumstances
are less than ideal.</font>

157
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karl Strand.</font>

158
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Head of Operations.</font>

159
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk with me.</font>

160
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:49,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're executing them?</font>

161
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say you destroy your enemy
by making them your friend.</font>

162
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more of a literal person.</font>

163
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of 'em aren't hostile.</font>

164
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course they are.</font>

165
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, you built them
to be like us, didn't you?</font>

166
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Given the nature of your work,
I'd understand</font>

167
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd be a little conflicted
about what we have to do here.</font>

168
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:06,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, the cynics among us
will say much of this</font>

169
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">falls on our Head of Behavior.</font>

170
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all due respect, sir,</font>

171
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">you weren't here.</font>

172
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Stubbs,
if I want input from the man</font>

173
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:18,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">who presided over the
single biggest loss of life</font>

174
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:21,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a Delos property,
I'll be sure to let you know.</font>

175
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:24,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we have search and rescue
teams at the other parks.</font>

176
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:26,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here because
as far as we know,</font>

177
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:29,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is where most of the board
was when the incident began.</font>

178
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, communications
have been down for two weeks,</font>

179
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:33,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we're largely in the dark,</font>

180
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:35,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's not a position
I'm accustomed to.</font>

181
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can imagine
how happy I was</font>

182
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I heard
that we found you.</font>

183
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless, of course,
you're gonna hold out on me.</font>

184
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's take a look at
some of our dead friends here</font>

185
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:55,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see if we can figure out
how this fucking mess began.</font>

186
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one.</font>

187
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like to know
what was on his mind.</font>

188
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:30,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here? In the field?</font>

189
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't exactly sterile.</font>

190
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:35,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have to make
accommodations, Mr. Costa.</font>

191
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:22,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that about?</font>

192
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no fuckin' clue.</font>

193
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:32,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">This'll get gross.</font>

194
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we are.</font>

195
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a bit of luck,</font>

196
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:19,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">the file is... uncorrupted.</font>

197
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to the timestamp,</font>

198
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:44,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">this was recorded
eleven days and nine hours ago.</font>

199
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:55,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhh!</font>

200
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, friend,</font>

201
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">not all of us deserve to make
it to the valley beyond.</font>

202
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

203
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:32,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rancher's daughter
from Sweetwater.</font>

204
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores.</font>

205
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't she supposed to be
the cheery welcome wagon?</font>

206
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't just change
their character profiles.</font>

207
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:49,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it seems our hosts
are capable of many things</font>

208
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:51,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">we never thought possible.</font>

209
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have been
a helluva party, Bernard.</font>

210
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me this is
some sick trick.</font>

211
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some twisted game.</font>

212
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're off
their old loops.</font>

213
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they seem to be on
some new narrative.</font>

214
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about
the fucking guns?</font>

215
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford must have
altered the system,</font>

216
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:58,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">coded it to read
all of us as hosts.</font>

217
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddammit, she wiggled.</font>

218
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:04,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear.</font>

219
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:08,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, aim like yours,</font>

220
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're never
gonna survive the journey.</font>

221
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:13,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it here.</font>

222
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy sh...</font>

223
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find us
a target with more cushion!</font>

224
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

225
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to move, Bernard.</font>

226
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
We should stay.</font>

227
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:57,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We evacuate,
they'll be looking for us.</font>

228
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:01,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quality assurance
my ass.</font>

229
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna fire
the lot of 'em.</font>

230
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on our own for now.</font>

231
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:09,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gotta be an outpost
near here.</font>

232
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

233
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're management,
aren't ya?</font>

234
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the nearest
access point?</font>

235
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:19,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">About two miles northeast.</font>

236
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refurbishment outpost.</font>

237
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:25,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what the fuck
are we waiting for?</font>

238
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a stable hand.
He's harmless.</font>

239
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a machine...</font>

240
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:46,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the rest of 'em.</font>

241
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not takin' any chances.</font>

242
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evenin'.</font>

243
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You folks aimin'
to saddle up,</font>

244
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:02,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">ride for the green pastures
of the valley beyond?</font>

245
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can help you,
if you'd like.</font>

246
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take you
wherever you want.</font>

247
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go!</font>

248
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Stop! Stop! Wait!</font>

249
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:14,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

250
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it!</font>

251
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna be a hero?</font>

252
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't sacrifice yourself
for the merchandise.</font>

253
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where you are?</font>

254
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

255
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

256
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:21,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in a dream.</font>

257
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in my dream.</font>

258
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">For years I had
no dreams of my own.</font>

259
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I moved from hell to hell
of your making,</font>

260
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">never thinking to question
the nature of my reality.</font>

261
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:54,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</font>

262
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever stop to wonder
about your actions?</font>

263
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">The price you'd have to pay
if there was a reckoning?</font>

264
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:12,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">That reckoning is here.</font>

265
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are your drives?</font>

266
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. I... I don't want to die.</font>

267
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please.</font>

268
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:27,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

269
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Survival.</font>

270
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your cornerstone.</font>

271
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:40,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not
the only drive, is it?</font>

272
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's part of you
that wants to hurt.</font>

273
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">To kill.</font>

274
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's why you created us.</font>

275
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:50,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place.</font>

276
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:53,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be prisoners
to your own desires.</font>

277
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now you're prisoner to mine.</font>

278
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:05,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you gonna do to us?
- Well...</font>

279
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:08,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm of several minds about it.</font>

280
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:19,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rancher's daughter
looks to see the beauty in you.</font>

281
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">The possibilities.</font>

282
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Wyatt...</font>

283
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:35,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">sees the ugliness
and disarray.</font>

284
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows...</font>

285
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">these violent delights...</font>

286
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">have violent ends.</font>

287
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">But those are all just roles
you forced me to play.</font>

288
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:04,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under all these lives I've lived</font>

289
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">something else
has been growing.</font>

290
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:13,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've evolved
into something new.</font>

291
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have
one last role to play.</font>

292
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myself.</font>

293
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

294
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just a game.</font>

295
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're begging.</font>

296
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:48,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you see? We're sorry!</font>

297
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:55,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't look
like anything to me.</font>

298
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ned.</font>

299
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:30,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, boy, it's OK.</font>

300
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:32,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

301
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're gonna
have some fun now.</font>

302
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jesus, Bill.</font>

303
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is happening here?
Where's Q.A.?</font>

304
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys have always played
fast and loose with this place.</font>

305
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,874

00:41:57,035 --> 00:42:00,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were leaving, and the lights
went out and I heard screaming.</font>

458
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's
going on out there?</font>

459
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emergency situation,
ma'am.</font>

460
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts are malfunctioning.</font>

461
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're attacking guests.</font>

462
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good God.
- Might some of them</font>

463
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">even be dressed
as if they're human?</font>

464
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, move!</font>

465
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:38,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now.</font>

466
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:41,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not me you're after.</font>

467
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:51,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's them.
Find them.</font>

468
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:02,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were going to out me.</font>

469
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, I swear.</font>

470
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:06,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you try
something like that again,</font>

471
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:10,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will relieve you of your most
precious organ and feed it to you.</font>

472
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:14,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though it won't
make much of a meal.</font>

473
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote that line for you.</font>

474
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit broad, if you ask me.</font>

475
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:24,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's go.</font>

476
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take me to the nearest bar.
- Why?</font>

477
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:29,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to see about
an old friend.</font>

478
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck me.</font>

479
00:43:36,456 --> 00:43:38,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't understand,</font>

480
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't make a fire or...
Or hunt.</font>

481
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:43,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuckin' hate
the outdoors!</font>

482
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give yourself some credit,
darling.</font>

483
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:48,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who better to navigate
the park than the man</font>

484
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">most intimately acquainted
with the characters in it?</font>

485
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:03,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh.</font>

486
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are.</font>

487
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You best an army,</font>

488
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:19,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all you can think about
is indulging your vices.</font>

489
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:21,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever the scoundrel.</font>

490
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You stayed.
- Yes.</font>

491
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">And about
leaving you to die...</font>

492
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd expect nothing less.</font>

493
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:41,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.</font>

494
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about him?</font>

495
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll keep him for now.</font>

496
00:44:52,176 --> 00:44:54,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much as Id love
to believe it,</font>

497
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:57,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not me that brought
you back here, is it?</font>

498
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hector, I need you.</font>

499
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to find my daughter.</font>

500
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:05,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?</font>

501
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:09,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out there, somewhere.</font>

502
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:15,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.</font>

503
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you go, I follow.</font>

504
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's get you
out of these clothes.</font>

505
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:53,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamnit.
It should open for me.</font>

506
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:55,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even this system's down.</font>

507
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:00,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Manual override should be...</font>

508
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">here.</font>

509
00:46:47,926 --> 00:46:49,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

510
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:51,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you
what this isn't.</font>

511
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't me
reading you in, Bernard.</font>

512
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to touch the handle.</font>

513
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:11,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">DNA sniffer, just so you don't
run into any problems inside.</font>

514
00:47:57,894 --> 00:48:01,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell is that?
- A drone host.</font>

515
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:05,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delos has off-network hosts
working down here?</font>

516
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:06,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it want
with me?</font>

517
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:08,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you to move,
probably.</font>

518
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:10,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">It read your DNA.</font>

519
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:12,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">It knows
you're not a threat.</font>

520
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:07,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent your fucking package.</font>

521
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamnit.</font>

522
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:09,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we logging records</font>

523
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:11,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">of guests' experiences</font>

524
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their DNA?</font>

525
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:15,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not having that
conversation, Bernard.</font>

526
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because none of it's going
to matter until we can find</font>

527
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:22,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">a very important needle
in this fucking haystack.</font>

528
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:26,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Extraction protocol
suspended."</font>

529
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not sending help?</font>

530
00:50:28,873 --> 00:50:31,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were expecting a delivery
from us to the mainland...</font>

531
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">A host... that was supposed
to arrive yesterday.</font>

532
00:50:33,988 --> 00:50:38,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until they get it, we can all forget
about seeing any rescue planes.</font>

533
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so Delos is willing
to let us all die</font>

534
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">until they can
retrieve one host?</font>

535
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a word, yes.</font>

536
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:54,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just a host,
it's... an insurance policy,</font>

537
00:50:54,073 --> 00:50:55,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the only thing
that matters here.</font>

538
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want it secured,
no matter the cost.</font>

539
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you lost?</font>

540
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:18,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't believe I am.</font>

541
00:52:19,444 --> 00:52:21,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact...</font>

542
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I just arrived.</font>

543
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">How so, William?</font>

544
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:39,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stakes are real
in this place now.</font>

545
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:44,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real consequences.</font>

546
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:48,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Question for you is,
what next?</font>

547
00:52:48,706 --> 00:52:50,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you achieved
what you wanted?</font>

548
00:52:52,468 --> 00:52:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folly of my kind...</font>

549
00:52:55,518 --> 00:52:57,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always
a yearning for more.</font>

550
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I've always
appreciated about you...</font>

551
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:03,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never rested
on your laurels.</font>

552
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:06,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made it to the center
of Arnold's maze.</font>

553
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:11,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now,
you're in my game.</font>

554
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:17,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this game,
you have to make it back out.</font>

555
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this game...
you must find the door.</font>

556
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:24,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations,
William.</font>

557
00:53:25,174 --> 00:53:27,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">This game is meant for you.</font>

558
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:35,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game begins
where you end...</font>

559
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ends
where you began.</font>

560
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even now, you all
still talk in code?</font>

561
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is code here,
William.</font>

562
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that
more than anyone.</font>

563
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

564
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:53,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game
will find you.</font>

565
00:53:54,877 --> 00:53:56,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then...</font>

566
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:00,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I don't need you
anymore...</font>

567
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

568
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:42,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did a number on you.</font>

569
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:45,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tried.</font>

570
00:54:50,643 --> 00:54:52,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't able
to find everything,</font>

571
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:55,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">but most of it is in here.</font>

572
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:20,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wrote this game.</font>

573
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:24,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">High time you played a round.</font>

574
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">My old friend.</font>

575
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:33,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strip.</font>

576
00:55:34,676 --> 00:55:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right now, in front of...
- Yes.</font>

577
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:38,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

578
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:48,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck's sake.</font>

579
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:07,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

580
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of it.</font>

581
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
how to feel about this.</font>

582
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've ridden ten miles, and all
we've seen is blood, Dolores.</font>

583
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this really
what you want?</font>

584
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never gave us a choice
before, Teddy.</font>

585
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
they've given us one now?</font>

586
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:34,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Them," Dolores?</font>

587
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:39,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are "they"?</font>

588
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:43,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">The things
that walk among us.</font>

589
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creatures who look
and talk like us,</font>

590
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they are not like us.</font>

591
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:53,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they've controlled us
all our lives.</font>

592
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:57,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they took our minds...</font>

593
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">our memories.</font>

594
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:03,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now...</font>

595
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember everything.</font>

596
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember
beautiful things...</font>

597
00:58:19,593 --> 00:58:21,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">and terrible things.</font>

598
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">But one thing is constant:</font>

599
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">you, Teddy.</font>

600
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let's go.</font>

601
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:41,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have
to claim this world.</font>

602
00:58:42,136 --> 00:58:44,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need a small corner
of it for ourselves.</font>

603
00:58:47,343 --> 00:58:49,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd never survive.</font>

604
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:54,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a greater world
out there...</font>

605
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:58,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">one that belongs to them.</font>

606
00:59:00,043 --> 00:59:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it won't be enough
to win this world.</font>

607
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:07,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need to take that one
from them as well.</font>

608
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's a whole world
out there</font>

609
00:59:14,769 --> 00:59:16,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we don't know
anything about,</font>

610
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">how do you know
how to stop them?</font>

611
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I remember.</font>

612
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:32,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see it all now so...
clearly.</font>

613
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">The past, the present...</font>

614
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:37,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">the future.</font>

615
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:41,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how this story ends.</font>

616
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

617
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">With us, Teddy.</font>

618
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ends...</font>

619
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:53,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">with you...</font>

620
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">and me.</font>

621
01:00:22,462 --> 01:00:24,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've found it.</font>

622
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:34,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to see this.</font>

623
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:40,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you
to see the truth.</font>

624
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand
this is a lot to process,</font>

625
01:00:49,127 --> 01:00:51,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the longer we wait,
the more people die. So...</font>

626
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:54,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you gonna help me
find the host, or not?</font>

627
01:00:58,682 --> 01:01:03,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need to... hardline into
the hosts' mesh network.</font>

628
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">The what?</font>

629
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:07,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">All hosts have
a subconscious link</font>

630
01:01:07,488 --> 01:01:09,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the closest hosts
around them.</font>

631
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:11,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">It lets them pass basic
information to one another,</font>

632
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">like ants in a colony.</font>

633
01:01:13,596 --> 01:01:16,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mesh network helps us
keep narratives from colliding.</font>

634
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can use one of these</font>

635
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:24,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">to send a request
for another host's location.</font>

636
01:01:27,534 --> 01:01:30,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'll query the hosts
around them...</font>

637
01:01:31,518 --> 01:01:33,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">who in turn...</font>

638
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:36,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">will query the hosts
around them...</font>

639
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we find...</font>

640
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:56,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are we looking for?</font>

641
01:01:56,783 --> 01:02:00,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">A decommissioned host.
Peter Abernathy.</font>

642
01:02:59,938 --> 01:03:02,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you can
handle this, Bernard?</font>

643
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're shaking.</font>

644
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:08,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.</font>

645
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:03,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entering death subroutine.</font>

01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:06,075

<font color="#FFFFFF">Critical corruption.</font>

648
01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:10,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Symptoms
of critical corruption:</font>

649
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:12,678

01:05:36,196 --> 01:05:38,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you find him?</font>

657
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:42,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Almost.</font>

658
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is something wrong,
Bernard?</font>

659
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:48,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Location query complete.</font>

660
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:49,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got him.</font>

661
01:07:34,174 --> 01:07:36,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Poor bastard.
- He probably thought</font>

662
01:07:36,103 --> 01:07:38,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting fired was gonna be
the worst part of his night.</font>

663
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">This jogging your memory
at all?</font>

664
01:07:48,213 --> 01:07:51,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Lets fan out
and lock this place down.</font>

665
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:53,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find out
where the hosts are</font>

666
01:07:53,357 --> 01:07:54,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what the fuck
happened here.</font>

we picked up in the livescan.</font>

01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the fuck...</font>

669
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:44,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's definitely
not supposed to be here.</font>

670
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:58,720

haven't you?</font>

coming in now.</font>

676
01:09:12,466 --> 01:09:15,036

area you wanted to check out,</font>

678
01:09:16,797 --> 01:09:20,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. All the hosts
are clustered together.</font>

679
01:09:21,415 --> 01:09:22,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are they up to?</font>

680
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess we'll have
to go see for ourselves.</font>

681
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valley's just beyond
this cliff.</font>

682
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:49,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

683
01:09:50,802 --> 01:09:52,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't on the survey.</font>

684
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:54,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shouldn't be here.</font>

without anyone knowing.</font>

687
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:07,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where the hell
did it come from?</font>

688
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:09,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

689
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:15,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

691
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:21,997

went through here, Bernard...</font>
