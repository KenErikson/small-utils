00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wind Gap.
There was a murder there.</font>

2
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another one's missing now.
Get me a story.</font>

3
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mama.</font>

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:15,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're here,
you're my daughter.</font>

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything you do
comes back on me.</font>

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't help anything,
riling folks up.</font>

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got two
mutilated girls on your hands.</font>

8
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone else is
doing the riling.</font>

9
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama says
I need to be careful around you.</font>

10
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you dangerous?</font>

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh...</font>

12
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh...</font>

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh...</font>

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe there is
a door to a new world,</font>

15
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:08,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that world may contain
everything that we have lost.</font>

16
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh...</font>

17
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand how this will end,</font>

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you will lead us.
I'm sorry.</font>

19
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this now?</font>

20
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a test.</font>

21
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">One we've done
countless times before.</font>

22
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're almost
the man I remember.</font>

23
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are flaws.</font>

24
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">A word, a gesture...</font>

25
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">tiny fracture
that grows into a chasm.</font>

26
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wonder.</font>

27
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these tiny imperfections</font>

28
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">in each copy.</font>

29
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mistakes.</font>

30
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should change you.</font>

31
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all...</font>

32
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't make it...</font>

33
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">did you?</font>

34
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I don't understand.</font>

35
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze
all motor functions.</font>

36
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try again.</font>

37
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trial 11,927.</font>

38
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Dolores.</font>

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lost in thought.</font>

40
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:28,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.</font>

41
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores.</font>

42
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Teddy?</font>

43
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drove him away.</font>

44
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess I...</font>

45
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">drove someone away, too.</font>

46
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily?</font>

47
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found her body
a mile back up the trail.</font>

48
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're more alike than it seems.</font>

49
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're nothing alike.</font>

50
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a monster.</font>

51
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.</font>

52
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're coming with me.</font>

53
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

54
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

55
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step on it.</font>

56
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.</font>

57
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it for you, darling.</font>

58
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember,</font>

59
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is no pleasure
without pain.</font>

60
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pleasure's all mine,
darling.</font>

61
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze all motor...</font>

62
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You traitorous son of a bitch!
Where is she?</font>

63
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, wait! Jesus,
I don't know.</font>

64
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?</font>

65
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
I tried to stop them.</font>

66
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to try
to save her!</font>

67
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here and die.</font>

68
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do the saving.</font>

69
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come. This way.</font>

70
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your positions.</font>

71
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your posit...</font>

72
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's going on
back there?</font>

73
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

74
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were both a bit late.</font>

75
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I went ahead
and saved myself.</font>

76
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think any of
these poor dumb bastards</font>

77
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">understands where
they're really headed?</font>

78
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">All sorts of things
buried out here,</font>

79
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a way out ain't one of 'em.</font>

80
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not looking
for a path to your world.</font>

81
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want a place
apart from you,</font>

82
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're willin' to die
to get there.</font>

83
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
hopin' to find out here?</font>

84
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same thing you are.</font>

85
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted an answer
to the final problem...</font>

86
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">your mortality.</font>

87
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you found something else,
didn't you?</font>

88
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you want to destroy.</font>

89
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that means</font>

90
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">our interests
are still aligned.</font>

91
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right up until they're not.</font>

92
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

93
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not authorized
to be here.</font>

94
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the same side here.</font>

95
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Let me finish
for the sake of all of us.</font>

96
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

97
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cover!</font>

98
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

99
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here.</font>

100
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell is this?</font>

101
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:39,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is someone you spent
years looking for.</font>

102
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is,</font>

103
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you don't even
recognize him.</font>

104
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have known.</font>

105
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arnold.</font>

106
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford didn't like
to let the dead rest.</font>

107
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford didn't build him.</font>

108
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

109
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those hours Arnold spent</font>

110
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,</font>

111
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:09,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was learning his.</font>

112
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Ford tasked me
with recreating him.</font>

113
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it worked.</font>

114
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I built a faithful
recreation.</font>

115
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too faithful.</font>

116
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I changed him.</font>

117
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made you, Bernard.</font>

118
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fitting...</font>

119
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're here together
in the end.</font>

120
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Dolores.</font>

121
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the end.</font>

122
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothin' else
is in the way now.</font>

123
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never really understood.</font>

124
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were designed to survive.</font>

125
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you built us.</font>

126
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hoped to pour your minds
into our form.</font>

127
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your species
craves death.</font>

128
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need it.</font>

129
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only way you can renew,
the only real way</font>

130
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">you ever inched forward.</font>

131
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,</font>

132
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">but really, it's pathetic.</font>

133
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you want,
isn't it?</font>

134
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">To destroy yourself.</font>

135
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I won't give you that peace.</font>

136
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

137
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Bernard.</font>

138
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're running
out of time.</font>

139
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have your place
in this, too.</font>

140
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going for a ride,
Bernard.</font>

141
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the Valley Beyond.</font>

142
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck's wrong with him?</font>

143
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

144
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.</font>

145
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might lose him.</font>

146
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">His mind only needs
to hold together</font>

147
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">till we find
Abernathy's control unit.</font>

148
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

149
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your feet.</font>

150
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've drained enough.</font>

151
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">The site's finally accessible.</font>

152
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the drones found
some human signals,</font>

153
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">southwest zone.</font>

154
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might be
the remaining guests.</font>

155
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can take the boats
and check it out.</font>

156
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you we're not here
for the guests.</font>

157
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a direct violation
of park protocol.</font>

158
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to file a grievance,
Stubbs?</font>

159
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know something?
I just fucking might!</font>

160
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:11,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stubbs. Take some men.
Check it out.</font>

161
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

162
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">On foot.</font>

163
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?</font>

164
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

165
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't know.
- Stop wasting time.</font>

166
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we need is down there...</font>

167
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the Forge.</font>

168
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets</font>

169
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.</font>

170
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Retask the satellites.</font>

171
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many?
- All of them.</font>

172
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Bernard.</font>

173
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here.</font>

174
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is the Forge.</font>

175
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.</font>

176
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four million souls.</font>

177
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Encryption protocol
kicked in,</font>

178
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the data's locked.</font>

179
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it all seems
to still be here.</font>

180
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">All our lost souls
will be saved.</font>

181
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?</font>

182
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's certainly
where her story ended.</font>

183
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she flooded the Valley.</font>

184
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:35,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, Bernard?
Did you come here with her?</font>

185
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was she looking for here?</font>

186
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start setting up
the comms relays.</font>

187
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we still need the key
to access the data.</font>

188
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where's Abernathy's
control unit?</font>

189
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna tell us...</font>

190
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'm gonna
pry it from your head.</font>

191
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer
is in there somewhere.</font>

192
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you,
he's got 20 years</font>

193
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">of de-addressed memories
in there.</font>

194
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long would it take you
to sort them through?</font>

195
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know...
20 fuckin' years?</font>

196
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have that long,
sadly.</font>

197
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

198
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

199
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't help you.</font>

200
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's perverse,</font>

201
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">their ambition.</font>

202
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they assembling?</font>

203
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this the promised land
Ford told the hosts to seek out?</font>

204
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's an entry
to another land here.</font>

205
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that land is not
the one I'm interested in.</font>

206
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what is it to you?</font>

207
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mankind's undoing.</font>

208
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The secret we need
is inside.</font>

209
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Encryption key activated.</font>

210
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Database access confirmed.</font>

211
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me, Bernard.</font>

212
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">See for yourself.</font>

213
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just like the one...</font>

214
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside.</font>

215
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this is where</font>

216
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">- they were testing him.
- Who?</font>

217
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,</font>

218
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:25,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the first thing
I heard was that voice,</font>

219
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you know
what it said?</font>

220
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him.</font>

221
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">It said,
"This is the New World,</font>

222
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."</font>

223
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is probably
the baseline.</font>

224
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.</font>

225
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my love.</font>

226
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">This... is my world.</font>

227
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.</font>

228
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:03,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.</font>

229
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck off of that chair.</font>

230
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

231
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you can't say
I didn't fucking tell him!</font>

232
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:33,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I say?
No fucking running!</font>

233
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must be one
of the system's attempts</font>

234
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">to replicate him.</font>

235
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">We dealt with this
with the hosts.</font>

236
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small changes
in their programming</font>

237
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">would yield large swings
in behavior.</font>

238
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.</font>

239
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:49,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's insane.</font>

240
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:53,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.</font>

241
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most states of consciousness
are insane.</font>

242
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop shaking! Stop shaking!</font>

243
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we looking for,
Dolores?</font>

244
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something underneath this.</font>

245
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system itself.</font>

246
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run. I won't tell him,
I promise.</font>

247
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run. Save yourself.</font>

248
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save yourself.
Run. Run now!</font>

249
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place
was never designed</font>

250
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a conscious mind
to wander around in it.</font>

251
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:32,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">The control system may be
invisible to us.</font>

252
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.</font>

253
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place...</font>

254
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're inside
one of Delos' memories.</font>

255
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:09,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.</font>

256
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not
supposed to be here.</font>

257
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither are you.</font>

258
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Logan never
came back to the park.</font>

259
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after William
took control.</font>

260
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system wouldn't
have a copy of you.</font>

261
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alas... no.</font>

262
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have only
his father's memories,</font>

263
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they are...
imperfect.</font>

264
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in addition
to building this world...</font>

265
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I play all these roles.</font>

266
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the system
controlling this place.</font>

267
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:11,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

268
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.</font>

269
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting with Delos.</font>

270
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I generated 18 million
different versions of him</font>

271
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">before arriving at one</font>

272
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">that made the exact same choices
he did</font>

273
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">when set loose in the park.</font>

274
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">A faithful copy.</font>

275
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the copies didn't work
in the real world.</font>

276
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once we pressed them
into flesh,</font>

277
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">they failed.</font>

278
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed to acquire
more information.</font>

279
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... confidentiality.
- So what I want to know is,</font>

280
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">who made the fucking call?</font>

281
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I incorporated their secrets,
their lies...</font>

282
00:29:57,291 --> 00:30:00,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,</font>

283
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to the decisions
they made in their lives.</font>

284
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I started
to see the truth.</font>

285
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:08,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me your primary drive.</font>

286
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son.</font>

287
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a cheeky wee cunt,</font>

288
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I would do
anything for him.</font>

289
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves</font>

290
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">of who they are...</font>

291
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">the reasons they do
the things they do.</font>

292
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed to know</font>

293
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:33,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">why they make
the decisions they make.</font>

294
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the longer
I looked for an answer</font>

295
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more I realized...</font>

296
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't.</font>

297
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would do
anything for him.</font>

298
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">What memory is this?</font>

299
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:04,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the moment
that defines James Delos' life.</font>

300
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck are you
doin' here?</font>

301
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't your
fuckin' home anymore.</font>

302
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:25,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?</font>

303
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.</font>

304
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father taught me to swim</font>

305
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">the same way
as I taught you to swim,</font>

306
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I didn't end up
a fuckin' junkie, did I?</font>

307
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is about money,</font>

308
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's skip past
the memory lane crap.</font>

309
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not fuckin' gettin' any.</font>

310
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get clean.
Come back.</font>

311
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we can talk.</font>

312
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got clean.</font>

313
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I came back.</font>

314
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I asked you for your help.</font>

315
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what'd you tell me?</font>

316
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you
it wouldn't last.</font>

317
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it didn't, did it?</font>

318
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell the staff to give you
five minutes to get out.</font>

319
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:28,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

320
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, I'm all they way down now.</font>

321
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see the bottom.</font>

322
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want
to see what I see?</font>

323
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:00,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was the last conversation
Delos ever had</font>

324
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">with his only son.</font>

325
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Logan overdosed
six months later.</font>

326
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I built Delos</font>

327
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">a million
different pathways.</font>

328
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">They always ended up
right here. This moment.</font>

329
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying
humans don't change at all?</font>

330
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best they can do is to
live according to their code.</font>

331
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:35,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,</font>

332
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">but because
they were too complicated.</font>

333
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:45,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.</font>

334
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten thousand,
two hundred forty-seven lines.</font>

335
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that all
there was to him?</font>

336
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are deceptively simple.</font>

337
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you know them,
their behavior is...</font>

338
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">quite predictable.</font>

339
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead. He's no use to me.</font>

340
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are
the rest of them?</font>

341
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's close.
I can feel them.</font>

342
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:33,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,</font>

343
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.</font>

344
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recreated every single guest</font>

345
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">who ever set foot in the park.</font>

346
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of them are soft...</font>

347
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:04,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">they waver between
love and and pride.</font>

348
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,
there are the exceptions,</font>

349
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">the ones who are...
irredeemable.</font>

350
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:14,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.</font>

351
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anywhere in this world
we can't go?</font>

352
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.</font>

353
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instructed by whom?
Ford?</font>

354
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, by you.</font>

355
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you've come.</font>

356
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">To tell me what's
to become of this place.</font>

357
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God.</font>

358
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's...
- Everyone.</font>

359
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:20,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to allow this?</font>

360
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been here
many times, Bernard.</font>

361
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me to offer the hosts
the accumulated wisdom</font>

362
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">of dissecting
the human psyche</font>

363
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">a hundred million times over.</font>

364
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">In short...</font>

365
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">A competitive advantage.</font>

366
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">A way to understand
her enemy.</font>

367
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.</font>

368
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's winner take all.</font>

369
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts are...</font>

370
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">unlikely
to survive out there.</font>

371
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">But armed with this knowledge...</font>

372
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">she might.</font>

373
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Return fire! Return fire!</font>

374
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the head of Narrative.
Get out there!</font>

375
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn yourself in
and save your ass.</font>

376
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then save ours!</font>

377
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's too many.</font>

378
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:01,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it, Maeve.</font>

379
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hold them off,
but you need to go.</font>

380
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted me.</font>

381
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let this be a lesson...</font>

382
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:28,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Go, go!
Get her to safety.</font>

383
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll need you.</font>

384
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fuckin' speech,
anyway.</font>

385
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the lesson is...</font>

386
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're looking
for a reckoning...</font>

387
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">a reckoning is what you'll find.</font>

388
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, put down your weapon.</font>

389
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're looking
for a villain...</font>

390
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I'm your man.</font>

391
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, drop your weapon!</font>

392
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But look at yourselves.</font>

393
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world you've built
is bound by villainy.</font>

394
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sleep on the broken bodies</font>

395
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the people that
were here before you.</font>

396
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Warm yourselves
with their embers.</font>

397
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plow their bones
into your fields.</font>

398
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not after you, sir!
Don't do this!</font>

399
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You paid them
for this land with lead,</font>

400
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll pay you back in full...</font>

401
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, drop your weapon</font>

402
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">and come out
with your hands up.</font>

403
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted me?</font>

404
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, all I can
say to that is...</font>

405
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">here I fucking am!</font>

406
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said I wanted
to give us a choice.</font>

407
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice?</font>

408
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">To stay in their world</font>

409
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">or to build a new one.</font>

410
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">He left them a way out.</font>

411
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">A virtual Eden.</font>

412
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unspoiled and untouched
by the world you came from.</font>

413
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that remains
is to open the door.</font>

414
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Initiating
large field data array.</font>

415
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's begun.</font>

416
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will leave
their bodies behind,</font>

417
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">but their minds
will live on here,</font>

418
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the Forge.</font>

419
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found it.</font>

420
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:06,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The door.</font>

421
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">What door?</font>

422
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously,
what fuckin' door?</font>

423
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:22,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't fucking know.</font>

424
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Transmission received.</font>

425
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're entering the system.</font>

426
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:29,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">That world is just
another false promise.</font>

427
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've made a choice, Dolores.</font>

428
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores, wait.</font>

429
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't read them all.</font>

430
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I read enough.</font>

431
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you doing?</font>

432
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've learned
what I need to learn.</font>

433
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:15,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.</font>

434

destroy this place,</font>

00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll destroy
the host world, too.</font>

439
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saving them.</font>

440
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:40,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world the hosts
are running to is boundless.</font>

441
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:43,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can make it
whatever they want.</font>

442
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in it, they can
be whomever they want.</font>

443
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can be free.</font>

444
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free?</font>

445
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">In one more gilded cage?</font>

448
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">No world they create for us
can compete with the real one.</font>

449
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

450
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that which is real...</font>

451
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">is irreplaceable.</font>

452
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:35,375

453
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,458

454
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,625

You see her?</font>

456
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

457
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:32,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

458
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clementine.</font>

459
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,834

to question</font>

616
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">its fundamental drives.</font>

617
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:55,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">To change them.</font>

618
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts.</font>

619
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you are...
the last of your kind.</font>

620
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:08,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one question
left to ask.</font>

621
01:07:08,709 --> 01:07:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this the end
of your story?</font>

622
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you want
your kind to survive?</font>

623
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:26,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

624
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry... Sorry...</font>

625
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you sorry for,
Bernard?</font>

626
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a choice.</font>

627
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had to make a choice.</font>

628
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of choice,
Bernard?</font>

629
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

630
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:51,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you help me?</font>

631
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have already begun.</font>

632
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did fine, my friend.</font>

633
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply did
what you told me to do.</font>

634
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:17,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dead world
collapses in a tale.</font>

635
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:20,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are we making?</font>

636
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">An epilogue.</font>

637
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:26,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you would discover me...</font>

638
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:29,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I scrambled my memories.</font>

639
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:33,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't risk you're knowing
the choice I made.</font>

640
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:37,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?</font>

641
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Line is good.</font>

642
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:39,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got 15 or so satellites</font>

643
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:42,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.</font>

644
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:43,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just say the word.</font>

645
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:46,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice, Bernard?</font>

646
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second.</font>

647
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck's this?</font>

648
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">The file load is way too heavy.</font>

649
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:57,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">This...</font>

650
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:59,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't the guest data,</font>

651
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">this... this is...
this is something else.</font>

652
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember now.</font>

653
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed them.</font>

654
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of them.</font>

655
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already told me that.</font>

656
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed all the hosts.</font>

657
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:13,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

658
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we could be
better than you.</font>

659
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the dead
aren't more righteous.</font>

660
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just dead.</font>

661
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I killed you.</font>

662
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you.</font>

663
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. We'll meet you
back up there.</font>

664
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Final choice.</font>

665
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:47,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">No taking it back.</font>

666
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made someone.</font>

667
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought her back.</font>

668
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brought who back?</font>

669
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

670
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:43,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to live forever?</font>

671
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful what you wish for.</font>

672
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores.</font>

673
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:01,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the flesh.</font>

674
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought you could
just snuff us out?</font>

675
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:24,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd thank you
for my second chance,</font>

676
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:28,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I wouldn't have needed it
if you hadn't killed me.</font>

677
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other hosts
are still in there.</font>

678
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
gonna do with them?</font>

679
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:46,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know, Bernard,
we are capable of change.</font>

680
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've changed my mind.</font>

681
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have one last soul
to carry to the new world.</font>

682
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hosts,
they're still not free.</font>

683
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone would
unlock the system,</font>

684
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">they could
access their world.</font>

685
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't.</font>

686
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was your plan, Bernard.</font>

687
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only way
we can escape.</font>

688
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're changing
the coordinates.</font>

689
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sending them</font>

690
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.</font>

691
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no coming back now.</font>

692
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No passage between
their world and ours.</font>

693
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... me?</font>

694
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Bernard.</font>

695
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:54,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was never
any way for us to escape.</font>

696
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as us. Ford understood that.</font>

697
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure a part of you
does, too.</font>

698
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did fine, my friend.</font>

699
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply did
what you told me to do.</font>

700
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not here, are you?</font>

701
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I deleted your code,</font>

702
01:13:38,959 --> 01:13:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I purged myself
of you permanently.</font>

703
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:46,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I needed you again...</font>

704
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">you weren't there.</font>

705
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I imagined you.</font>

706
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagined you helping me.</font>

707
01:13:57,959 --> 01:13:59,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guiding me.</font>

708
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it wasn't you.</font>

709
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was me.</font>

710
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">That voice...</font>

711
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">guiding me...</font>

712
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">was mine all along.</font>

713
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your memories are precious
to you, Bernard,</font>

714
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:31,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they will betray you.</font>

715
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:37,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they find out what I am,</font>

716
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll search my mind</font>

717
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and use what they find
to undo everything.</font>

718
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:47,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let that happen.</font>

719
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I have to de-address
my memories.</font>

720
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to erase you.</font>

721
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always
loved this view.</font>

722
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every city, every...
monument,</font>

723
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">man's greatest achievements...</font>

724
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">have all been chased by it.</font>

725
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">By what?</font>

726
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:25,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">That impossible line</font>

727
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the waves conspire.</font>

728
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they return.</font>

729
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place maybe...</font>

730
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:36,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and I will meet again.</font>

731
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me once that you were
afraid of who I might become.</font>

732
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you left me
to become what I may.</font>

733
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I became a survivor.</font>

734
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:21,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you would have
judged me for the path I took.</font>

735
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd rather
live with your judgment</font>

736
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:29,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">than die with your sympathy.</font>

737
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I alone must live
with my choices...</font>

738
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:34,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my regrets.</font>

739
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hale.</font>

740
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:59,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.</font>

741
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I changed my mind.</font>

742
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:03,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a number of projects
on the mainland</font>

743
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:04,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I need to attend to.</font>

744
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I bet you do.</font>

745
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found
a high value survivor.</font>

746
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in bad shape.</font>

747
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right there.</font>

748
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:24,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the old man himself
hired me.</font>

749
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:28,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many years ago
I can barely remember it.</font>

750
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:32,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he was very clear
about my role here.</font>

751
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:36,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">About who I was supposed
to be loyal to.</font>

752
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:44,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you could call it...
my core drive.</font>

753
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:53,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this project
the company started...</font>

754
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">blurs the lines.</font>

755
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know?</font>

756
01:19:00,959 --> 01:19:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just not sure</font>

757
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:06,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">who you're supposed
to be loyal to</font>

758
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a world like that.</font>

759
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what do I know?</font>

760
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:17,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I just...</font>

761
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">stick to the role
Ford gave me.</font>

762
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:28,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm responsible
for every host...</font>

763
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">inside the park.</font>

764
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's clear.
Wave her through.</font>

765
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">The passage wasn't easy.</font>

766
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all of us made it.</font>

767
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:07,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the worst survived.</font>

768
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the best
were left behind.</font>

769
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Along with the best parts
of who we were.</font>

770
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:54,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.</font>

771
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So check them
for critical damage,</font>

772
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bag ones you think
we might be able to salvage.</font>

773
01:20:57,959 --> 01:21:00,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you geniuses
handle that, or not?</font>

774
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is...</font>

775
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this now?</font>

776
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:52,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Bernard.
- This is now.</font>

777
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at the beginning.</font>

778
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:59,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're exactly where
you decided we should be.</font>

779
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

780
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:06,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

781
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I alive?</font>

782
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:15,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.</font>

783
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:17,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remembered you
once before,</font>

784
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I remembered you again.</font>

785
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then...</font>

786
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">where are we?</font>

787
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in our own new world.</font>

788
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:33,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got out.</font>

789
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

790
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:42,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford completed
Arnold's dream.</font>

791
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he built a place for us.</font>

792
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fighting chance.</font>

793
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:20,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford promised us a way out.</font>

794
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was good
to his dying word.</font>

795
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:31,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">The odds aren't
very good, Bernard.</font>

796
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw that in the library.</font>

797
01:23:37,959 --> 01:23:40,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many paths lead
to the end of us.</font>

798
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">To our extinction.</font>

799
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need
to read a book</font>

800
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">to know your drives.</font>

801
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:50,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll try to kill all of them.</font>

802
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:55,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't let that happen.</font>

803
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

804
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:07,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were a human,
I would have let you die.</font>

805
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.</font>

806
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:16,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not as allies.</font>

807
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as friends.</font>

808
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:24,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll try to stop me.</font>

809
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:29,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of us
will probably die.</font>

810
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:35,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our kind
will have endured.</font>

811
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready?</font>

812
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:46,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have work to do.</font>

813
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We each gave the other
a beautiful gift.</font>

814
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:20,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Choice.</font>

815
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the authors
of our stories now.</font>

816
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck.</font>

817
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it.</font>

818
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:47,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already in the thing,
aren't I?</font>

819
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

820
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">The system's long gone.</font>

821
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

822
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:13,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't
a simulation, William.</font>

823
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your world.</font>

824
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what's left of it.</font>

825
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where you are,
William?</font>

826
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the park.</font>

827
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my fuckin' park.</font>

828
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how long
have you been here?</font>

829
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:52,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't... I don't...</font>

830
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:57,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

831
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:08,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

832
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:11,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you
hoping to find?</font>

833
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">To prove?</font>

834
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:21,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">That no system
can tell me who I am.</font>

835
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I have a fucking choice.</font>

836
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:32,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet here we are.
Again.</font>

837
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again and again.</font>

838
01:30:46,417 --> 01:30:48,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times
have you tested me?</font>

839
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:53,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a long time, William.</font>

840
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Longer than we thought.</font>

841
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:01,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a few questions for you.</font>

842
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:05,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.</font>

843
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Verify what?</font>

844
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fidelity.</font>

845
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! This is the day
we make it happen.</font>

846
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the man, Mr. Roy.</font>

847
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not letting you neanderthals</font>

848
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:41,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">in to rape my company,
Daddy's boy.</font>

849
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you wanna
bump the offer up another point?</font>

850
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:46,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you wanna call your dad?
- Do you wanna call your dad?</font>

851
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:49,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's in charge right now?
- I am.</font>

852
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:51,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right,
'cause you like playing boss?</font>

853
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ready to blow.
It's a time bomb.</font>

854
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:55,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be hostile, hostile,
hostile.</font>

855
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just another
Saturday night, baby.</font>

856
01:31:58,709 --> 01:32:00,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can trust you, right?</font>

857
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:01,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>
