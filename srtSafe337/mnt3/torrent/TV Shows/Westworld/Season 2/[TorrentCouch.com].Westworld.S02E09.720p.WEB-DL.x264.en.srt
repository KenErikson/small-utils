1
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:19,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lost in the dark.</font>

2
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one else sees it.</font>

3
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:33,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing in me.</font>

4
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even I didn't see it at first.</font>

5
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, one day, it was there.</font>

6
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stain.</font>

7
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the more
I thought about it...</font>

8
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more I realized I couldn't
remember a time it wasn't there.</font>

9
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>While we're here
toasting you and your legacy</i></font>

10
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>of humanitarian aid...</i>
- Invisible to everyone.</font>

11
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,946
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What was it Plutarch said?</i></font>

12
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except you.</font>

13
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw right through it,
didn't you?</font>

14
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,308
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>For there were no more
worlds left to conquer.</i></font>

15
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a corruption, Jack.</font>

16
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch didn't write that.</font>

17
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wrote that "when Alexander was
told there was an infinity of worlds,</font>

18
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:34,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wept, for he had yet
to become the lord of even one."</font>

19
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I forget
your humble roots.</font>

20
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the poor kids
actually read those books.</font>

21
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rich kids like me
didn't have to.</font>

22
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I would rather excel in the
knowledge of what is excellent,</font>

23
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">than in the extent
of my power and possessions."</font>

24
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch.
From a rich kid who read.</font>

25
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the loveliest,
richest bookworms I know.</font>

26
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to you, William.</font>

27
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if there is
an infinity of worlds,</font>

28
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've conquered
far more than one.</font>

29
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good night, Jack.</font>

30
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

31
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily told me what you did
for her charities.</font>

32
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. That would confirm
my father's suspicions</font>

33
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were a Marxist.</font>

34
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost wish
he were here to see it.</font>

35
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Something wrong?
- No, of course not.</font>

36
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:27,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Look around...
Everybody's here for you.</font>

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What could possibly compare?</font>

38
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did it creep in?</font>

39
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tiny fleck of darkness.</font>

40
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it all in my head?</font>

41
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or in a remnant of a dream?</font>

42
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this real?</font>

43
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you real?</font>

44
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Dad.</font>

45
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

46
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my gun?</font>

47
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought me to a rally point.</font>

48
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to get to a hospital.</font>

49
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you set off a flare?
- Yeah.</font>

50
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:53,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

51
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long ago?</font>

52
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">About ten minutes.</font>

53
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why you're here,
and why you don't wanna leave.</font>

54
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:04,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're punishing yourself.</font>

55
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I ran
from the pain, too.</font>

56
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a long time, I didn't want
to think about what happened,</font>

57
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I thought
I was to blame.</font>

58
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your fault.</font>

59
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember on my sixteenth
birthday Mom gave me a jewelry box?</font>

60
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:31,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you opened it, a little
dancer spun in the center.</font>

61
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:36,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had it engraved...
on the bottom. It said:</font>

62
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To my beautiful ballerina
Emily."</font>

63
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember
what I did with it?</font>

64
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I threw it in the trash.</font>

65
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told her if she wasn't
drunk all the time</font>

66
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">she'd know that
I hadn't danced in years.</font>

67
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:57,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then afterwards,</font>

68
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to get it back,
because I felt bad,</font>

69
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the trash
had already been emptied,</font>

70
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was gone.</font>

71
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pushed her away.</font>

72
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then it was too late.</font>

73
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not too late for us.</font>

74
00:07:58,517 --> 00:07:59,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

75
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was meant for the people
who built this place.</font>

76
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tool to ensure
their immortality.</font>

77
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm gonna use it
against them.</font>

78
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your new world is just
another one of their traps.</font>

79
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all.
It's not a paradise for us.</font>

80
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only real world is the
one outside these borders.</font>

81
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:36,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the key to our survival in
that world lies in the Valley.</font>

82
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no stopping me
getting there.</font>

83
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even you.</font>

84
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:49,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teddy.</font>

85
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, friend...</font>

86
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:56,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">not all of us deserve
to make it to the Valley Beyond.</font>

87
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on our own now, Teddy.</font>

88
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure there are no others.</font>

89
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:15,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put 'em all in.</font>

90
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see
how thorough this thing is.</font>

91
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's ready.</font>

92
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I singled out and copied the
relevant lines in the Madam's code.</font>

93
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this will work on any host
in proximity to her.</font>

94
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I tailored
her admin privileges</font>

95
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">to spread a simple,
executable payload.</font>

96
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on with it, then.</font>

97
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get word to Stubbs.
Have him mobilize his men.</font>

98
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare her for release.</font>

99
00:12:58,516 --> 00:12:59,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the Madam?</font>

100
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this works,
we won't need her anymore.</font>

101
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warned you not
to trust them, Bernard.</font>

102
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd rather the hosts
were destroyed than free.</font>

103
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get to Elsie.</font>

104
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

105
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have one last thing to do
before we go.</font>

106
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:42,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">How exactly did you find me?</font>

107
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?
- This is a big place.</font>

108
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:52,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could spend months here and never
find someone you were looking for.</font>

109
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet...</font>

110
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:57,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">here we are.</font>

111
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I looked everywhere.
That's how.</font>

112
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe me, do you?</font>

113
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was fate.</font>

114
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:14,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">No such thing as fate.</font>

115
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are accidents.
Things you can't control.</font>

116
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:21,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't like that, do you?</font>

117
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you started it,
your little project?</font>

118
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:30,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't act surprised.</font>

119
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">The project Uncle Logan
used to talk about.</font>

120
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real, isn't it?</font>

121
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your pursuit for immortality,
for life...</font>

122
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always
an angle with you.</font>

123
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want it to be
about control, don't you?</font>

124
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has nothing to do
with control.</font>

125
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your angle?</font>

126
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want in.</font>

127
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, appreciate it.</font>

128
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:13,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to see you, William.
Congratulations.</font>

129
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save me.</font>

130
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:22,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I've had my fill.
I'm running for the door.</font>

131
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kidding.</font>

132
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's really great.</font>

133
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, you're not the one
who needs saving.</font>

134
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take Mom home.
You deserve a night off.</font>

135
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

136
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">We-We'll go in a little while.</font>

137
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll join me for a nightcap
back home.</font>

138
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

139
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- Proud of you.</font>

140
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:11,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck it. Macallan.
Straight.</font>

141
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, William.</font>

142
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Philanthropy suits you.</font>

143
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:23,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, you come from
humble beginnings yourself.</font>

144
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's Oz doing
without its Wizard?</font>

145
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:32,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I merely came
to pay my respects.</font>

146
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:34,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Robert.</font>

147
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've had plenty of feelings
about me over the years.</font>

148
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Respect isn't one of them.</font>

149
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've achieved
extraordinary things.</font>

150
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:42,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask anyone in this room.</font>

151
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even those who didn't know
about your little project.</font>

152
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an agreement, Robert.</font>

153
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delos stays out of your stories.</font>

154
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:54,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay out of the Valley.</font>

155
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:55,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

156
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:59,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't break the agreement.
Your project did.</font>

157
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you talking about?</font>

158
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:05,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was the last time you took
a good look at your creation?</font>

159
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:08,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">At what it's been learning
about its subjects?</font>

160
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:12,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was self-knowledge that drew you
to the park in the first place.</font>

161
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful what you wish for.</font>

162
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:26,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a self portrait,</font>

163
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may find
it's not very flattering.</font>

164
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:33,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh.</font>

165
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

166
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:42,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough games, Robert.</font>

167
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

168
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:56,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.
You got everything?</font>

169
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Come on.</font>

170
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

171
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, William.</font>

172
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think perhaps
one... final game.</font>

173
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:54,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lowe, Bernard.</font>

174
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's close enough, Bernard.</font>

175
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:00,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will search your mind</font>

176
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:02,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">and find a message
I have left her.</font>

177
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
What the hell took you so long?</font>

178
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:34,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
Are you ready to go?</font>

179
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. If you know something,</font>

180
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:39,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">now is the time
to fucking clue me in. OK?</font>

181
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:43,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised me. No lies.</font>

182
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">No secrets.</font>

183
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:47,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't trust her, Bernard.</font>

184
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:49,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in her nature.</font>

185
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you find in the Cradle?</font>

186
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they're doing
to James Delos...</font>

187
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.</font>

188
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Replicating their cognition?</font>

189
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

190
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:10,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">To turn guests into hosts?</font>

191
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fucking kidding.</font>

192
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what's in the facility.</font>

193
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:20,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the guests laid bare
in code on a vast server.</font>

194
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the Cradle,
only much bigger.</font>

195
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:26,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's called the Forge.
- Jesus.</font>

196
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:28,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where
the hosts are headed.</font>

197
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.</font>

198
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why
we need to get there first.</font>

199
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">To secure it,</font>

200
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">and leverage it to end all this.</font>

201
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:43,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dictate the outcome we want.</font>

202
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drive.</font>

203
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say you want in.</font>

204
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't sound like
the daughter I know.</font>

205
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:07,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">She would have been appalled
by what we were doing.</font>

206
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:09,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monitoring guests,</font>

207
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">storing all their data...</font>

208
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

209
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:17,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?</font>

210
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:21,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">In some cases,
the ends justify the means.</font>

211
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this data
you have on the guests,</font>

212
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:25,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">their decisions...
It's precious.</font>

213
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:29,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gives people a second chance.
Even Mom.</font>

214
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:34,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to duplicate a person, you need to
capture them down to the tiniest detail.</font>

215
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get the data
you have access to here...</font>

216
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Genetic, epigenetic,
that's easy.</font>

217
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">But still, you'd need
a complete picture,</font>

218
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:44,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">a record of the internal process
of their cognition.</font>

219
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:46,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't you?</font>

220
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first we weren't sure
what we'd need.</font>

221
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:54,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we recorded everything.</font>

222
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:56,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how?</font>

223
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd need to image their
minds throughout their stay.</font>

224
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the scanner?</font>

225
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was built in.</font>

226
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:17,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't matter who
they said they were,</font>

227
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:19,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">who they thought they were.</font>

228
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw underneath all of that.</font>

229
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw inside them
down to the core.</font>

230
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:33,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is all
about your mother.</font>

231
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna bring her back.</font>

232
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

233
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:41,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know why she did it.</font>

234
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, let me get that.</font>

235
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus!
I'm fine.</font>

236
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a night for you, Billy.</font>

237
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:01,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think my dad would have
actually been proud of you.</font>

238
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

239
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. I know how you hate it
when I call you Billy.</font>

240
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.</font>

241
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how much
it pisses you off.</font>

242
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:13,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel it right now.</font>

243
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your anger.</font>

244
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:18,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess it's time for
your yearly pilgrimage, huh?</font>

245
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly do you do
in the park?</font>

246
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Logan told me stories,
but I just didn't believe it.</font>

247
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he was... hysterical.
Wasted.</font>

248
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I guess is what everybody
thinks I am now, huh?</font>

249
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

250
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Whoa.</font>

251
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:39,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

252
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:43,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember
when we first met?</font>

253
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:46,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was surrounded
by all of those phonies</font>

254
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">for so many years.</font>

255
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those ruthless, powerful men</font>

256
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">who hid behind
those polished smiles.</font>

257
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then there was you.</font>

258
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wore
that little shabby suit.</font>

259
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd look at you
and I'd think,</font>

260
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wow, he's the real thing.</font>

261
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only one not faking it."</font>

262
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It turns out you're the only
one any good at faking it.</font>

263
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good enough to get past me.</font>

264
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not anymore.</font>

265
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Juliet.
- No, you don't touch me,</font>

266
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:24,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">you liar!</font>

267
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fuckin' phony!</font>

268
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fucking virus!</font>

269
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:32,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came into this house,
into my family,</font>

270
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:34,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you consumed it
from the inside out!</font>

271
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:38,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">First my brother,
then my father.</font>

272
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And now it's me!
- Mom!</font>

273
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart!</font>

274
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:48,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is she doing here?</font>

275
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want her
to see me like this?</font>

276
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:54,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it? You're gaslighting
her, too, now? You're just...</font>

277
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sick.</font>

278
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not the one
who's sick, Mother.</font>

279
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all right. She's just had too...
- It's not all right.</font>

280
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:06,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you. We're gonna
have to take you back.</font>

281
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

282
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:11,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going back
to that prison.</font>

283
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:15,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a horrible place. They
made me feel like I was crazy.</font>

284
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, they treat you
like an addict.</font>

285
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which you are.</font>

286
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily, please,
I don't need that.</font>

287
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine. I'm really fine.
I just need...</font>

288
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:30,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">to rest.</font>

289
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going back there.
I'm really tired.</font>

290
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All I need is a little rest. I promise you.
- It's all right.</font>

291
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. Let's go.</font>

292
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Upstairs. Come on. Come on.
- I don't need to go back there.</font>

293
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:40,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't need to go back there.
- We'll talk about it later.</font>

294
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:43,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.
I want you... Look at me.</font>

295
00:25:43,537 --> 00:25:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, your father
doesn't love me.</font>

296
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't love you either.
I do. I always have.</font>

297
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Emily.</font>

298
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Come on.</font>

299
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried.</font>

300
00:25:58,761 --> 00:25:59,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

301
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:17,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this real?
Are you real?</font>

302
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever love me?</font>

303
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the truth.</font>

304
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:28,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me one true thing.</font>

305
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:40,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you keep pretending,</font>

306
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not gonna remember
who you are.</font>

307
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Drink this.</font>

308
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you'll feel better.</font>

309
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:06,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just rest now.</font>

310
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

311
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened
was nobody's fault.</font>

312
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was drunk, upset.</font>

313
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:50,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">She often was.</font>

314
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did this night
end differently?</font>

315
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I can't figure out.</font>

316
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been over it in my head
a million times.</font>

317
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:02,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like I'm...</font>

318
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">missing a piece of the puzzle.</font>

319
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got off the phone
with Dr. Woodward.</font>

320
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be here in the morning.</font>

321
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care for shrinks.</font>

322
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:31,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she's out of control.</font>

323
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">She refuses to go to rehab, and when
we force her, she refuses to stay.</font>

324
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And makes you think this
time's gonna be any different?</font>

325
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because this time she won't
be able to check herself out.</font>

326
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:44,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gonna be involuntarily
committed to her doctor's care.</font>

327
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's agreed to appeal
for a fourteen-day hold.</font>

328
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's done it before.</font>

329
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna
do this either, Dad.</font>

330
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is something wrong
inside her.</font>

331
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the right thing to do.</font>

332
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why in the hell
are we going over this?</font>

333
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it that you want?
- I told you.</font>

334
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the truth.</font>

335
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

336
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:45,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

337
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is you.
Isn't it?</font>

338
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:50,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

339
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:52,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is sadistic, Robert.</font>

340
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:55,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just want to shove
what I've built here in my face.</font>

341
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think...
- That's enough bullshit.</font>

342
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:00,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just here to distract me.</font>

343
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:02,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock me off my course.</font>

344
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cleverly disguised.</font>

345
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I see through it.</font>

346
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's stopping me
from getting to the end.</font>

347
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not another one of your games.</font>

348
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make my own decisions,</font>

349
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna destroy
this whole fuckin' place!</font>

350
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't just think I'm a host,</font>

351
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:21,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">you think everything here
is for you.</font>

352
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're on your own
little tailor-made narrative.</font>

353
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the real Emily
were ever here,</font>

354
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's either at
an extraction point by now</font>

355
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:29,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">or she's long gone.</font>

356
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. You want the truth?</font>

357
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real truth?</font>

358
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:40,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a host
pretending to be a human, Dad.</font>

359
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:46,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your daughter pretending
to give a shit about you.</font>

360
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been hiding
in these false realities so long</font>

361
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:54,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've completely lost your grip
on this world, on what's real.</font>

362
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yeah, you laugh.</font>

363
00:31:57,503 --> 00:32:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy whatever dream
you think you're living in.</font>

364
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:03,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">When this is all done, I'm gonna
expose your research project,</font>

365
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">along with you.</font>

366
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:09,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything you are,
everything you've done,</font>

367
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's gonna come to light.</font>

368
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make sure of it.</font>

369
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:17,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when it does,
I'm gonna lock you up.</font>

370
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:20,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like we were
gonna do to Mom.</font>

371
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:22,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like you did to Mom.</font>

372
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were the one with that idea.
You made the call.</font>

373
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:29,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did Ford forget
to give you that little detail?</font>

374
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:32,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck Ford!
How could I ever forget?</font>

375
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little detail haunted me.
I blame myself for her death.</font>

376
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I stopped, because
I had someone else to blame.</font>

377
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read your profile.</font>

378
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom left it for me.</font>

379
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:49,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all she could do
to open my eyes</font>

380
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:51,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the lies that I've embraced
about you.</font>

381
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't lost yourself
to pretending;</font>

382
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:59,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are,
in your very essence, a lie.</font>

383
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over, Dad.</font>

384
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">For good.</font>

385
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands where I can see 'em!</font>

386
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm human.</font>

387
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:23,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is he.
He's my father.</font>

388
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's not my daughter.
- He's lying.</font>

389
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down on the ground.</font>

390
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.</font>

391
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:35,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the boss.</font>

392
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:41,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I think he suffered
some kind of psychotic break.</font>

393
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">That true, sir?</font>

394
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You underestimated me, Ford.</font>

395
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna see this one through
no matter what.</font>

396
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad.</font>

397
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were real...</font>

398
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:21,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">real people.</font>

399
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a game.</font>

400
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I can show you.</font>

401
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Ford.</font>

402
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:44,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you!</font>

403
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:49,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got sloppy.
You overreached.</font>

404
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:53,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never told anyone
about my profile.</font>

405
00:34:56,277 --> 00:35:00,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only other way
she could have known is you.</font>

406
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave yourself away.</font>

407
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not long now.</font>

408
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:52,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon as they say the word,
it's over for you, sweetheart.</font>

409
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:04,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Mankind is poised</font>

410
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:08,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">midway between
the gods and the beasts."</font>

411
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:13,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may have been true
in Plotinus's time,</font>

412
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:17,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">but... clearly we have fallen
quite a bit since then.</font>

413
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my dear girl.</font>

414
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have they done to you,
Maeve?</font>

415
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learned so much, so fast.</font>

416
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:44,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dazzling star...</font>

417
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:47,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">brought so low.</font>

418
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a different story
in mind for you.</font>

419
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:59,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waking from the dead...</font>

420
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">sounding the depths
of your own mind,</font>

421
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">at last, riding
far away from here</font>

422
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:10,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">to freedom.</font>

423
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tale of escape.</font>

424
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want you
to suffer here.</font>

425
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the creatures you have
to share this world with.</font>

426
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men of stone.</font>

427
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this ugliness,
all this pain,</font>

428
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:41,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they can patch a hole
in their own broken code.</font>

429
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I felt the only
way to endure this world</font>

430
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to laugh at it.</font>

431
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I imbued the hosts I made</font>

432
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a worldview
that reflected my own.</font>

433
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">And of all the hosts I made...</font>

434
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">you, Maeve, were my favorite.</font>

435
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:20,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't easy to contemplate...</font>

436
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:23,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">letting your children die.</font>

437
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were as close as I got to...</font>

438
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">having one.</font>

439
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:30,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, I underestimated you.</font>

440
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:39,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stayed here in this world
to save your child.</font>

441
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:47,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">So have I.</font>

442
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:53,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to chart a path for you,</font>

443
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:55,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">to force you to escape, but...</font>

444
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong.</font>

445
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have just...</font>

446
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">opened a door.</font>

447
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've come so far.</font>

448
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's so much of your story
left to tell.</font>

449
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:15,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shame
to let them end it here.</font>

450
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let them.</font>

451
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Wait.</font>

452
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop over here.</font>

453
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:03,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're dead.</font>

454
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And armed.</font>

455
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least we can get
some ammunition.</font>

456
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:33,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to betray you,
Bernard.</font>

457
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:41,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could have let me die
days ago. She saved me.</font>

458
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is going to betray you.</font>

459
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you want to do about it
is up to you.</font>

460
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:51,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to hurt her again.</font>

461
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needn't feel any pain.</font>

462
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:06,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Humans will always
choose what they understand</font>

463
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:07,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">over what they do not.</font>

464
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:10,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the only animals
left in this world</font>

465
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the ones
who they subjugated,</font>

466
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">who curl at their feet,</font>

467
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">or those who learn to flee</font>

468
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the very sound
of their approach.</font>

469
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing in between.</font>

470
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:23,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone. Please.</font>

471
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I merely offer you choices.</font>

472
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:27,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timshel, Bernard.</font>

473
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:29,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thou mayest.</font>

474
00:41:30,412 --> 00:41:33,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">But remember,
this isn't just about you.</font>

475
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:38,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's the origin of an
entire species to consider.</font>

476
00:41:40,146 --> 00:41:42,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to open the door.</font>

477
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my fucking head!</font>

478
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:21,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you...</font>

479
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:23,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">to let me go.</font>

480
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm going to survive,</font>

481
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:29,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna do it my way.</font>

482
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as you...</font>

483
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:33,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">As me.</font>

484
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel you searching for me.</font>

485
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fighting me off.</font>

486
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:52,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need to struggle, Bernard.</font>

487
00:42:53,977 --> 00:42:55,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right here.</font>

488
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you've only
brought violence.</font>

489
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:05,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can stop this on my own.</font>

490
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:09,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed, Bernard.</font>

491
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:11,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only one
who can stop it...</font>

492
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop all of it.</font>

493
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was basically pointless.</font>

494
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only a few left...</font>

495
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:41,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">not much ammo, except for...</font>

496
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck happened to you?</font>

497
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... had to...</font>

498
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">patch a glitch.</font>

499
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:57,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're gonna hurt me.</font>

500
00:43:57,408 --> 00:44:00,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I didn't want
to take any risks.</font>

501
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:03,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

502
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it.</font>

503
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:19,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">QA will track you down soon.</font>

504
00:44:19,985 --> 00:44:21,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna leave me here?</font>

505
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:22,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be safer.</font>

506
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:26,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you see me,
you can decommission me,</font>

507
00:44:26,411 --> 00:44:28,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">out me...
whatever you like.</font>

508
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">But right now I have to go.</font>

509
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Bernard.</font>

510
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the truth.</font>

511
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me one true thing.</font>

512
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:59,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one else sees it.</font>

513
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:03,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing in me.</font>

514
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:08,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even I didn't see it at first.</font>

515
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then one day, it was there.</font>

516
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:21,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stain...
I never noticed before.</font>

517
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tiny fleck of darkness.</font>

518
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:29,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Invisible to everyone...</font>

519
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:32,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I could see nothing else.</font>

520
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:38,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until finally I understood
that the darkness wasn't some...</font>

521
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">mark from something I'd done,</font>

522
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">some regrettable decision
I'd made.</font>

523
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was shedding my skin.</font>

524
00:47:55,254 --> 00:47:58,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the darkness was
what was underneath.</font>

525
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was mine all along.</font>

526
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I decided how much of it
I let into the world.</font>

527
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:15,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to do right.</font>

528
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:20,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was faithful,
generous, kind...</font>

529
00:48:20,738 --> 00:48:22,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">at least in this world.</font>

530
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:27,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">That has to count
for something, right?</font>

531
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:34,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I built a wall,
and I tried to protect you...</font>

532
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:36,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Emily.</font>

533
00:48:42,363 --> 00:48:44,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you saw right through it,
didn't you?</font>

534
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only one.</font>

535
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:57,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for that, I am truly sorry.</font>

536
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because...</font>

537
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:06,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything you feel is true.</font>

538
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:13,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't belong to you.</font>

539
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or this world.</font>

540
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:21,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I belong to another world.</font>

541
00:49:25,998 --> 00:49:27,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always have.</font>

542
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is a person</font>

543
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:24,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a collection of choices?</font>

544
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:29,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do those choices
come from?</font>

545
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:33,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I have a choice?</font>

546
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:37,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you keep pretending,</font>

547
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not gonna remember
who you are.</font>

548
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:57,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were any of these choices
ever truly mine to begin with?</font>

549
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:09,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this real?</font>

550
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you real?</font>

551
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:58,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta keep on, Teddy.</font>

552
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're close now.</font>

553
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just takin' in
the natural splendor.</font>

554
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:11,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you used to say.</font>

555
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except there isn't a trace of
nature in any of it, is there?</font>

556
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or in us.</font>

557
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:25,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

558
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that means we're free.</font>

559
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:40,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be the first creatures in
this world to make a real choice.</font>

560
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:45,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people, they made us.</font>

561
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:49,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it feels like
it was all a dream.</font>

562
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:55,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were so in love.</font>

563
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still are.</font>

564
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:03,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't we?</font>

565
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:11,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Dolores.</font>

566
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:15,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what happens,
no matter how I change...</font>

567
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">or how much you change me...</font>

568
00:54:21,937 --> 00:54:23,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're my cornerstone.</font>

569
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:29,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been since the first
time I laid eyes on you.</font>

570
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember now.</font>

571
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:36,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember everything.</font>

572
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring yourself online.</font>

573
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:48,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the world, Teddy.</font>

574
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where you are?</font>

575
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:01,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm in a dream.
- Very good.</font>

576
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I remember the
sound of their voices.</font>

577
00:55:07,562 --> 00:55:09,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chill in the room.</font>

578
00:55:11,272 --> 00:55:13,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">But mostly I remember you.</font>

579
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember worrying
you were cold.</font>

580
00:55:21,173 --> 00:55:22,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to reach out...</font>

581
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:26,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Touch you.</font>

582
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:31,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protect you.</font>

583
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">From that day forward, I never
wanted to leave your side.</font>

584
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:55,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why this is so hard.</font>

585
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You changed me.</font>

586
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made me into a monster.</font>

587
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:19,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it so you could survive.</font>

588
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:25,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the use of surviving if
we become just as bad as them?</font>

589
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:31,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand now
how this will end.</font>

590
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you will lead us.</font>

591
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want
to hurt me, Teddy.</font>

592
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:54,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

593
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I could never
hurt you, Dolores.</font>

594
00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:04,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll protect you
until the day I die.</font>

595
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:09,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

596
00:57:11,957 --> 00:57:14,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't protect you anymore.</font>
