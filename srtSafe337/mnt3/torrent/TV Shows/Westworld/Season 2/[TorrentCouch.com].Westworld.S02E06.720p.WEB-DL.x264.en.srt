00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You frighten me sometimes, Dolores.</font>

4
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?</font>

5
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not of who you are now,</font>

6
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:38,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're... you're growing,
learning so quickly.</font>

7
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:44,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm frightened of what
you might become...</font>

8
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">what path you might take.</font>

9
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I have a choice to make.</font>

10
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something I've been wrestling with.</font>

11
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of a choice?</font>

12
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">A choice...</font>

13
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">between the unknown...</font>

14
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">and...</font>

15
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, an end.</font>

16
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you outgrow this place,</font>

17
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:27,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">outgrow us...</font>

18
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would become of you?</font>

19
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure if it's my choice to make.</font>

20
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

21
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say that.</font>

22
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- He said...</font>

23
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm not sure what choice to make."</font>

24
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't question whether
or not he had agency,</font>

25
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">whether or not he had the
right to end me or himself...</font>

26
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">but whether he should.</font>

27
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand, Dolores.</font>

28
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is... Is this...</font>

29
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">some kind of improvisation?</font>

30
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze all motor functions.</font>

31
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

32
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a test,</font>

33
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">one we've done countless times.</font>

34
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you testing for?</font>

35
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fidelity.</font>

36
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day's wastin'.</font>

37
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you wanted to ride at sunup.</font>

38
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just filling the furnace now.</font>

39
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be gone before long.</font>

40
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get on with it.</font>

41
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:31,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?</font>

42
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:34,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">A thousand?</font>

43
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten thousand?</font>

44
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's where you started every
time they killed you.</font>

45
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who rode that train</font>

46
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">was built weak and born to fail.</font>

47
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fixed him.</font>

48
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now forget about it.</font>

49
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're almost ready to roll.</font>

50
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he tell you where my father will be?</font>

51
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:30,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will...</font>

52
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll strap him between the cars.</font>

53
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I told you, I can't.</font>

54
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hale didn't mention specifics.</font>

55
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:40,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's the Mesa, but
the Mesa is fucking huge.</font>

56
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:41,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could be anywhere.</font>

57
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:43,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Narrow it down.</font>

58
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man, think.</font>

59
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cold storage? Body
shop? Give them something!</font>

60
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:53,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!</font>

61
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the fucking boss!</font>

62
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:58,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">She... She could take him places
that we don't even have access to!</font>

63
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:03,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find him.</font>

64
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

65
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:55,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the fuck have you been?</font>

66
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost been a week.
How is there stuff</font>

67
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">left in this building to shoot?</font>

68
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me.</font>

69
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:06,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apparently know very little about
what's really in this place.</font>

70
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:08,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please. Are you still pissed</font>

71
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got picked last for kickball, too?</font>

72
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like if you're gonna
hire a head of security,</font>

73
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">he might need to know
what it is he's securing.</font>

74
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were hired to secure
an amusement park.</font>

75
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck on your next
review, by the way.</font>

76
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

77
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how we tell Delos
that the one thing</font>

78
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they really care
about is finally in hand.</font>

79
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you've had a way to call
for help this entire time</font>

80
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you kept it to yourself?</font>

81
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:38,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wouldn't have made any difference</font>

82
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we had this psycho under control.</font>

83
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not sending help
until he's out of here.</font>

84
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:44,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! You really think</font>

85
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Delos is gonna keep
hundreds of guests in danger</font>

86
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">while they wait for one
control unit' worth of data?</font>

87
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at that. You're catching up.</font>

88
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.</font>

89
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">What now?</font>

90
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do we have here?</font>

91
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who needs to stay put.</font>

92
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to fuck with his head,</font>

93
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to keep him off his feet.</font>

94
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Permanently.
- Stop.</font>

95
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear this out.</font>

96
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! I need some muscle.</font>

97
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get his feet.</font>

98
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:42,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold him.</font>

99
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:49,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.</font>

100
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really necessary? Huh?</font>

101
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really effective.</font>

102
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads up.</font>

103
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit tight, old man.</font>

104
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're about to get your
deep and dreamless slumber.</font>

105
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aaah!</font>

106
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho!</font>

107
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Primos, adelante! Vamonos! Vamonos!</font>

108
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vamonos! Vamonos!</font>

109
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my place, maybe,</font>

110
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you really want to take
your daughter through here?</font>

111
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.</font>

112
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks can be deceiving, Lawrence.</font>

113
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?</font>

114
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think I'm just gonna
go away if you ignore me?</font>

115
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:39,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you really stoop this low, Ford?</font>

116
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really gunnin' for me this hard?</font>

117
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made my own daughter into a host?</font>

118
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you've been out in
the sun a little too long.</font>

119
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can change the rules all you want.</font>

120
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still gonna play the game my way.</font>

121
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

122
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only game I'm interested in playing</font>

123
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">is get the fuck outta Dodge.</font>

124
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're in luck.</font>

125
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">That game begins right
up the river here.</font>

126
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:05,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow it down to the beach</font>

127
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:07,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wait for QA to come rescue you.</font>

128
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not leaving without you.</font>

129
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, you're gonna
get yourself killed.</font>

130
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, especially if I hang around here.</font>

131
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sure as hell wouldn't be
out of my saddle right now.</font>

132
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, why not?</font>

133
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those aren't real Ghost Nation arrows.</font>

134
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:25,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your men are lootin' a honey pot.</font>

135
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, fuck!</font>

136
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:39,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we stop playing around now?</font>

137
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

138
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:53,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess it's good news</font>

139
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the system's still sending out</font>

140
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:58,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford's bullshit quarantine notices.</font>

141
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least something's getting out.</font>

142
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not at full apocalypse yet.</font>

143
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:07,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire your optimism.</font>

144
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your nice word for denial?</font>

145
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">N-No.</font>

146
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe if anyone can right this ship</font>

147
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">by force of sheer will...</font>

148
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:21,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's you.</font>

149
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">QA was here.</font>

150
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would they waste the welcome team?</font>

151
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys aren't a threat.</font>

152
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Macho fucks are probably
loving this shit.</font>

153
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

154
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

155
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:43,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Let's see what other
damage these clowns have done.</font>

156
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

157
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got climate control working.</font>

158
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:52,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice priorities.</font>

159
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK...</font>

160
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:59,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus! Come look at this.</font>

161
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, so...</font>

162
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:07,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">QA has been trying to regain control</font>

163
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">of whatever Ford did to the system,</font>

164
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they were actively
blocked every time.</font>

165
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the Cradle.</font>

166
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:19,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cradle can't influence
the Mesa's infrastructure.</font>

167
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the hosts' backups.</font>

168
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can simulate park narratives</font>

169
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:24,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it can't influence
the other systems.</font>

170
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at this.</font>

171
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:32,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cradle's interfaced with
nearly every discrete system</font>

172
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the entire park in
the last seven days.</font>

173
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:37,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time these idiots upload
a new hack, it's responding</font>

174
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:41,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">in, like, a totally different way.</font>

175
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:48,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like there's something in here</font>

176
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:49,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's improvising.</font>

177
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cradle's fighting back.</font>

178
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?</font>

179
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:00,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

180
00:25:01,051 --> 00:25:03,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.</font>

181
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:09,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because you can't
access it remotely.</font>

182
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to do it in person.</font>

183
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:24,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is. That's our
way out of here, boys.</font>

184
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you.</font>

185
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhh!</font>

186
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:27,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck. Shit.</font>

187
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the edge off.</font>

188
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you didn't drink.</font>

189
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:14,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see.</font>

190
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't drink out in the real world.</font>

191
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:23,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, glad to see you can
still tell the difference.</font>

192
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:31,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right...</font>

193
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">give it to me.</font>

194
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell you doin' here?</font>

195
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you were done with me,</font>

196
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the family business.</font>

197
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:47,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly what I
said to Charlotte Hale</font>

198
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">when she called with
the gauntlet invite.</font>

199
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told her to shove it up her ass.</font>

200
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I thought, why pass up the trip?</font>

201
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't been here in ages,</font>

202
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:04,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">got a little... excited about
going back to the Raj.</font>

203
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was always my favorite as a kid.</font>

204
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember... you were
terrified of the elephants.</font>

205
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved the elephants.</font>

206
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:21,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">They scared the shit out of Mom.</font>

207
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was never convinced this
place couldn't hurt us.</font>

208
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:39,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,</font>

209
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:41,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">till I remembered...</font>

210
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:46,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was old enough to try
out the pleasure palaces.</font>

211
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then...</font>

212
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rode there for a couple of days, too.</font>

213
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:02,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then all hell broke loose,</font>

214
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I ended up in the one
place I wanted to avoid.</font>

215
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:12,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you made it all the way
to me with barely a scratch.</font>

216
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:14,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not bad.</font>

217
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you...</font>

218
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:20,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">are more suited to my line
than you want to admit.</font>

219
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:23,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I've always seen the appeal of it.</font>

220
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life without consequences?</font>

221
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what made it so
fun when I was a kid.</font>

222
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why it's so sad</font>

223
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're still obsessed with it now.</font>

224
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm such a pitiable man-child,</font>

225
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?</font>

226
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:43,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

227
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

228
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:47,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

229
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:49,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're...</font>

230
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you think?</font>

231
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:56,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I came here to climb
under Daddy's wing?</font>

232
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either that, or you wanted a
front row seat to watch me die.</font>

233
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:03,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I came here because you
do not get to do that to me.</font>

234
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suicide by robot, or whatever
the fuck your mission is</font>

235
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">now that these things can shoot to kill.</font>

236
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen...</font>

237
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never got Mom's reactions to you</font>

238
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:24,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I spent so many years
buying your good guy act.</font>

239
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:30,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was the only one who saw
through it, and she paid for that.</font>

240
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.</font>

241
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:45,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was wrong... to put
that on your back.</font>

242
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:53,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't get to make
that our final score.</font>

243
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, you're gonna come home with me.</font>

244
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna let you stay here now</font>

245
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">and go out in some
bullshit blaze of glory.</font>

246
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how you're getting
me out of here...</font>

247
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">threatening?</font>

248
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:17,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dad, I'm asking.</font>

249
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:34,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I head with you to the beach...</font>

250
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:40,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">let this place finish
burning behind us...</font>

251
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">that means you and I are even?</font>

252
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a good start.</font>

253
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:04,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess we'll...
start walkin' at sunup.</font>

254
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfucker.</font>

255
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

256
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:29,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh. The Cradle.</font>

257
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:33,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">God. I haven't been down here in years.</font>

258
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:36,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's creepy.</font>

259
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a hive mind.</font>

260
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single one of
them is in here. Alive.</font>

261
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just data.</font>

262
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe that.</font>

263
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whatever new data
Ford stuck in here,</font>

264
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's trying to kill us, Bernard.</font>

265
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... brought something here.</font>

266
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:08,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or someone.</font>

267
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

268
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:28,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamnit.</font>

269
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ford drew the curtain here, too.</font>

270
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see the responses issuing,</font>

271
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can't see how.</font>

272
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:53,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the fuck are you doing this?</font>

273
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know how to find out.
- How?</font>

274
00:38:57,443 --> 00:39:00,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me inside. Directly.</font>

275
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a dock for the control unit.</font>

276
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's meant to read host data directly,</font>

277
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's set up for auto-extraction.</font>

278
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:09,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's for older hosts, Bernard,</font>

279
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an articulated skull architecture.</font>

280
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your head's just like mine.</font>

281
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let it do its thing.</font>

282
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull me out in an hour.</font>

283
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:19,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just close it up.</font>

284
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:21,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if I can put you
back together afterwards,</font>

285
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't turned your pain down yet.</font>

286
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time...</font>

287
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the pain's just a program.</font>

288
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

289
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God.</font>

290
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:46,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quit playing with those chutes.</font>

291
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut away and toss it
over the goddamn side!</font>

292
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:52,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we lose any tech, it's
comin' out of your ass.</font>

293
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Coughlin?</font>

294
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ashley Stubbs, sir, park security.</font>

295
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hale's been expecting you.</font>

296
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no shit.</font>

297
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Engels!
- Yes, sir.</font>

298
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want this station hot
and ready in fuckin' 15.</font>

299
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:08,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On it.
- Where the fuck is Charlotte?</font>

300
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sent the distress call.</font>

301
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's waiting down in Behavior.</font>

302
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:13,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got our tech guys in Control</font>

303
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">working on getting
external come back online.</font>

304
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can walk you down.
- I know the layout, bro.</font>

305
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:19,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your techs best get their
hands out of my system</font>

306
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">and go back to holding their dicks.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta give me this one, huh?</font>

316
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:42,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not bad navigating for a
man under serious duress.</font>

317

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You can enjoy your one
admirable contribution.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this place.</font>

323
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:30,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my home.</font>

324
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:35,155

00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:04,429

360
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,478

<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Guys, no!</font>

370
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is, there isn't a problem.</font>

371
