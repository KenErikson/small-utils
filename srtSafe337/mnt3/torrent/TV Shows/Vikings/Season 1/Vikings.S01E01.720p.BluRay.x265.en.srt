00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar!</font>

2
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:31,276
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Odin!</i></font>

3
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar!</font>

4
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed.</font>

5
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's one.</font>

6
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Let's go home.</font>

7
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch.</font>

8
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you two doing?</font>

9
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking Bjorn to the thing tomorrow.</font>

10
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.
He's not old enough.</font>

11
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:37,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's 12 years old.
- Take him next year.</font>

12
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next year is soon enough.</font>

13
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll need a silk ribbon, Lagertha.</font>

14
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a handsome boy.</font>

15
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny ears, though.</font>

16
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't sleep with lots of women in Kattegat.</font>

17
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do without it for a few days.</font>

18
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that another way of saying you love me?</font>

19
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always dream of you.</font>

20
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, I dreamt
you were feeding me blood pudding.</font>

21
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

22
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means you're giving me your heart.</font>

23
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your dog, boy.</font>

24
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frodi!
Come on, boy.</font>

25
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will happen at the thing?</font>

26
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Earl will deal with
some criminal offenses,</font>

27
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then, we'll discuss the summer raids.</font>

28
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And where will you go?
- The Earl decides.</font>

29
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">He owns the ships.</font>

30
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll send us to the east,
as always, to the Baltic lands,</font>

31
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I want to know what's to the west.</font>

32
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">What cities and gods are over there.</font>

33
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:28,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I'm not satisfied with this.</font>

34
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin gave his eye to acquire knowledge,</font>

35
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I would give far more.</font>

36
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">And will Earl Haraldson let you?</font>

37
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

38
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like this, nice and tight.</font>

39
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on three.</font>

40
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three.</font>

41
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Gyda.</font>

42
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gyda, feed the goats.</font>

43
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on!</font>

44
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want?
- We know you're all alone here.</font>

45
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the men are gone.</font>

46
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're thirsty, I will give you a drink.</font>

47
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're hungry, I will feed you.</font>

48
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, you must go.</font>

49
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:41,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will eat and drink
after we've satisfied our other needs.</font>

50
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to kill you, woman.</font>

51
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't kill me
if you tried for 100 years.</font>

52
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out!</font>

53
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to confess my love to her,</font>

54
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was set upon by a bear</font>

55
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an enormous hound who guarded her home.</font>

56
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed the bear with my spear,</font>

57
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:01,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I managed to strangle the
hound with my bare hands.</font>

58
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is how I gained
her hand in marriage.</font>

59
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she tell you the same story?</font>

60
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just about.</font>

61
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready to receive
your arm ring and become a man?</font>

62
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

63
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what does a man do?</font>

64
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He fights.
- And?</font>

65
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks after his family.</font>

66
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

67
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you look after our family?</font>

68
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?
You look after us.</font>

69
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say I wasn't there.</font>

70
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a big decision to make.</font>

71
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may change many things.</font>

72
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.</font>

73
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn!</font>

74
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, here you are, brother.
- Rollo.</font>

75
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">By Freyr and all the gods, how you've grown.</font>

76
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Rollo.</font>

77
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you here for the thing?
You're a real man now.</font>

78
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, let's get a drink.</font>

79
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking a little pale, Bjorn.</font>

80
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready for a woman?</font>

81
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's some good-looking women in Kattegat.
Some of them are free.</font>

82
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't even grow a beard, can you, boy?</font>

83
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go lie down?</font>

84
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where do you think
the Earl is going to send us this year?</font>

85
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those bastards to the east
are as poor as we are.</font>

86
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

87
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we should sail west.</font>

88
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard such tales, Rollo.</font>

89
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great towns and cities and treasures.</font>

90
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoards of gold and silver, and a new god.</font>

91
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard those stories, too,
but what does it mean?</font>

92
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't sail across an open ocean.</font>

93
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe there's a way to go west.</font>

94
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something that will change everything.</font>

95
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

96
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that?
- Now just listen.</font>

97
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">A while back, I met someone,</font>

98
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">a wanderer.</font>

99
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:26,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me it was possible to go west,
over the open sea,</font>

100
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">using this.</font>

101
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a sun board.</font>

102
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs to sit in water.</font>

103
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another wanderer?</font>

104
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This time, it's different.
- Now tell me, Ragnar, this wanderer of yours,</font>

105
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- has he ever sailed west himself?
- Just get some water.</font>

106
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this candle is the sun.</font>

107
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, the sun rises up
into the sky until noon.</font>

108
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">See how the shadow shortens?</font>

109
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">At noon, it is at its shortest.</font>

110
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">That only tells me
how far south I have traveled.</font>

111
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't I just tell you to listen?</font>

112
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day before sailing,
you mark a circle around the pointer</font>

113
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the shadow is at its shortest at noon.</font>

114
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next day at sea,</font>

115
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">you place the board back into water
around noon and watch the shadow.</font>

116
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If the shadow only touches the circle...
- Your course remains true?</font>

117
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

118
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...</font>

119
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you have drifted, and you
must steer further south.</font>

120
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

121
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what if it never reaches the circle?</font>

122
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you are too far south,
and must steer more to the north.</font>

123
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it!</font>

124
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep the noon shadow on the circle,</font>

125
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your course will be true.</font>

126
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">West.</font>

127
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if there is no sun?</font>

128
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can the board help you then?</font>

129
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you find your way?</font>

130
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using this.</font>

131
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me outside.</font>

132
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call it a sunstone.</font>

133
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?</font>

134
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is the sun.</font>

135
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we go west.</font>

136
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on.</font>

137
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

138
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

139
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:36,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Olaf Anwend, you have pleaded
guilty to the charge of stealing.</font>

140
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:40,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, you will run a gauntlet of stones
and turf as punishment.</font>

141
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.</font>

142
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:51,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it be known, a fine is to be paid
by anyone who fails to throw something.</font>

143
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring in the next accused.</font>

144
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There he is!
- Murderer!</font>

145
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn him!</font>

146
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Trygvasson, you are
accused of the murder</font>

147
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Sigvald Strut this January.</font>

148
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you plead?</font>

149
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't murder, Lord.
I killed him in self-defense.</font>

150
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liar!</font>

151
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it wasn't murder, why did
you not declare your crime</font>

152
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the first person that you met
afterwards, as the law obliges?</font>

153
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:31,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, you passed by several houses
before you reported it.</font>

154
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the relatives of the dead man
might be living in them.</font>

155
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">The law allows you to pass two houses,</font>

156
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:44,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">in such circumstances, but never a third.</font>

157
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You murdered my brother in cold blood!</font>

158
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not true!</font>

159
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We argued about some disputed land.
He pulled out a knife!</font>

160
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted that land for yourself!</font>

161
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a liar and a coward.</font>

162
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward.</font>

163
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

164
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the normal procedures were not followed,</font>

165
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">this killing cannot be atoned for</font>

166
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">by compensating the victim's family.</font>

167
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.</font>

168
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carried out in secret, unacknowledged,</font>

169
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">and likely to give rise to a
series of revenge killings</font>

170
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">that would involve your own family.</font>

171
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord, you knew about that land.</font>

172
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You knew I had a claim to it...
- Enough!</font>

173
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask you to look to the accused.</font>

174
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think that he is guilty,
raise your arms.</font>

175
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">The decision must be unanimous.</font>

176
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Trygvasson,</font>

177
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have been found guilty of murder.</font>

178
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Justice!</font>

179
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you wish to die?</font>

180
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">By beheading, Lord.</font>

181
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wish is granted.
You shall be executed tomorrow.</font>

182
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">After which we shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.</font>

183
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to.</font>

184
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is he smiling, Father?</font>

185
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to die well, without fear,</font>

186
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">to atone for his sins.</font>

187
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must watch, for his sake.</font>

188
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:04,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his only hope of reaching Valhalla.</font>

189
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feed him to your pigs!</font>

190
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I curse him.</font>

191
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">May he never enter Valhalla.</font>

192
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">May he never feast with the gods.</font>

193
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why did he do that?
- He should not have done that.</font>

194
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone told me
he wanted that land for himself,</font>

195
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he knew Trygvasson had the best
claim to it, but refused to sell it.</font>

196
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that, boy?
This is how things are done around here.</font>

197
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Olaf, son of Ingolf,</font>

198
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn, son of Ragnar,</font>

199
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:07,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">may you accept this gift of salt and earth</font>

200
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:13,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">to remind yourself
that you belong to both the land and the sea.</font>

201
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:26,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">These arm rings bind you in loyalty to me,
your lord, your chieftain.</font>

202
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any oath that you swear on these rings
must be honored and kept.</font>

203
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand and swear to this?</font>

204
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.</font>

205
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you freely give your fealty to me,
your lord, your chieftain?</font>

206
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.</font>

207
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. You may put
on the arm rings.</font>

208
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

209
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us feast!</font>

210
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord,</font>

211
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">we all want to feast,</font>

212
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we also want to know
where we will be raiding this summer.</font>

213
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't it wait, Ragnar?</font>

214
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Tell us.</font>

215
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want to know.</font>

216
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have a right to know.
- Very well.</font>

217
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:47,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will raid east again, to the eastlands
and into Russia.</font>

218
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every year</font>

219
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">we go to the same places!</font>

220
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is an alternative,</font>

221
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you choose.</font>

222
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes. Choice, yes.</font>

223
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have heard of these rumors, these stories.</font>

224
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:16,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">That if we travel west,
that we will somehow reach a land</font>

225
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is rich and plentiful.</font>

226
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:25,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I tell you that I will not
risk my ships or my reputation</font>

227
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">on such a deluded fantasy.</font>

228
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are my ships.
I pay for them.</font>

229
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they go where I tell them to go.</font>

230
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that's the end of the matter.</font>

231
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's feast!</font>

232
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see!</font>

233
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a fine ring.</font>

234
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

235
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earl Haraldson wants to
speak with you in private.</font>

236
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with your uncle.</font>

237
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

238
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

239
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you hungry?</font>

240
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord.</font>

241
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to feast in my hall?</font>

242
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to sail in my ships?</font>

243
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything else you want from me?</font>

244
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:08,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord...
- You keep talking about the west.</font>

245
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know of it? Hmm?</font>

246
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so certain
that it's a land of great riches?</font>

247
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be sure.</font>

248
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:22,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I believe that...
- I don't care what you believe.</font>

249
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You insulted me out there,</font>

250
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not for the first time,</font>

251
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, believe me, it will be the last.</font>

252
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who told you you could go?</font>

253
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a farmer.</font>

254
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be content with your lot.</font>

255
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farms are few and in great demand,</font>

256
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there are many people here who
would like to possess your land.</font>

257
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand what I'm saying?</font>

258
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

259
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:20,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then don't ever stick
your nose in my face again.</font>

260
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust him.
Watch him.</font>

261
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we
going now? I'm so tired.</font>

262
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">To talk to the gods.</font>

263
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what we do.</font>

264
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.</font>

265
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

266
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

267
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know what the gods have in store.</font>

268
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you, or for the boy?</font>

269
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more interested in myself.</font>

270
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods desire you to have a great future.
I see that.</font>

271
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they can withdraw
their goodwill at any time.</font>

272
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">To have this great future,</font>

273
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">must I challenge the law?</font>

274
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:50,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must convince
the gods to alter the runes</font>

275
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they work in your favor.</font>

276
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the laws of men</font>

277
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.</font>

278
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I should take the laws of men</font>

279
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">into my own hands?</font>

280
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me.</font>

281
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already have your answer.</font>

282
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

283
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then go and ask the gods yourself.</font>

284
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you afraid of?</font>

285
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait outside.</font>

286
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

287
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't helped me at all, ancient one.</font>

288
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you asked the wrong questions.</font>

289
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

290
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are my sons?</font>

291
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you'd found them.</font>

292
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have someone special to visit.</font>

293
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His name is Floki.
- "Floki"?</font>

294
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Loki, the god?</font>

295
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, only different.</font>

296
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How is he different?
- He's not a god.</font>

297
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why didn't he come to the thing?
- Because...</font>

298
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's shy.</font>

299
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.</font>

300
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. How are you?</font>

301
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well. Thank you, sir.</font>

302
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.</font>

303
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have your father's eyes</font>

304
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">unfortunately.</font>

305
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why unfortunately?</font>

306
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means he will be like you,</font>

307
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">and therefore
he will want to do better than you,</font>

308
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will hate him for it.</font>

309
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?</font>

310
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same with trees.</font>

311
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell which trees will make</font>

312
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">the best planks just by looking at them.</font>

313
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can look inside the tree.</font>

314
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki is a boat-builder.</font>

315
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Among other things.</font>

316
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is one.</font>

317
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside this tree are two
almost perfect planks.</font>

318
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will bend, then curve,</font>

319
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a woman's bod
from the thighs to the back.</font>

320
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I split this tree, I will find them.</font>

321
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can see that?</font>

322
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm joking?</font>

323
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:37,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I joke about many things, son of Ragnar,</font>

324
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">but never about ship-building.</font>

325
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you imagine ships are just dead things?</font>

326
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what about our boat?</font>

327
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be lighter and carry a bigger sail.</font>

328
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">The construction is different.</font>

329
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's built with a strong central plank.</font>

330
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two strakes above it are nailed
directly onto the knees of the frame.</font>

331
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the ones below... Look!</font>

332
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are cleated and lashed onto
the frames, not nailed,</font>

333
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they can move in relation to each other.</font>

334
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">This means the boat
won't butt against the waves like a goat,</font>

335
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">but move over them like a ripple.</font>

336
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?</font>

337
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will cut them into the sheerstrakes,</font>

338
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.</font>

339
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think
it could handle long sea voyages?</font>

340
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I'm building it.</font>

341
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">But will it be strong enough?</font>

342
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't know that until we try.</font>

343
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will it be ready?</font>

344
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">As to that...</font>

345
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- We're out of money.</font>

346
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to pay for the sail
and then the anchor.</font>

347
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what those blacksmiths
are like, greedy bastards.</font>

348
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the anchor.</font>

349
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.</font>

350
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

351
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll soon be as rich as dwarves!</font>

352
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed you.</font>

353
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:32,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did anything happen while we were away?</font>

354
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

355
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you miss me?</font>

356
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ached with love longing.</font>

357
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">My belly was empty of laughter.</font>

358
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you want? Hmm?</font>

359
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to make you laugh?</font>

360
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to laugh now.</font>

361
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:17,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to ride you, like a bull.</font>

362
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a wild bull.</font>

363
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, young Bjorn.
- Hello, Rollo.</font>

364
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are your parents?</font>

365
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are having sex.</font>

366
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

367
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:07,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we'll have to wait.</font>

368
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Gyda,</font>

369
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">is your mother teaching
you how to use a shield?</font>

370
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I know how to use a shield.</font>

371
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.</font>

372
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:35,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Was"?
- Is a famous shield-maiden.</font>

373
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">We fought in the same shield
wall against the eastlanders.</font>

374
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">She fought like a valkyrie.</font>

375
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, children, to bed.</font>

376
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's leave the men.</font>

377
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm a man.
I have a ring.</font>

378
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let him stay awhile.
- To bed!</font>

379
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say good night.</font>

380
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, my children.</font>

381
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

382
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.
Good night.</font>

383
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

384
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Father.</font>

385
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me your news.</font>

386
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the boat?</font>

387
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nearly ready.</font>

388
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you trust Floki?</font>

389
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't he a great joker?</font>

390
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a great boat builder.
I trust him to do that.</font>

391
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't go under your command.</font>

392
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't go unless we're all equal.</font>

393
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are brothers.</font>

394
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I will always be equal.</font>

395
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we must find a crew.</font>

396
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not many men will go
against the wishes of Haraldson.</font>

397
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many will be afraid.</font>

398
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some may even go to him and betray us.</font>

399
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must go piss.</font>

400
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday, I was with a girl from the town.</font>

401
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

402
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good-looking girl, too.</font>

403
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when she shouted out in pleasure,</font>

404
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see her face.</font>

405
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw yours.</font>

406
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lagertha...</font>

407
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk like that.</font>

408
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

409
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think about you all the time.</font>

410
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's too bad.</font>

411
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:42,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't insult me, shield-maiden.
- No.</font>

412
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never insult you.</font>

413
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too great a warrior,</font>

414
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">but perhaps not so great a man.</font>

415
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw something.</font>

416
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see?</font>

417
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sign.</font>

418
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made me certain we're
doing the right thing.</font>

419
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, brother.</font>

420
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's...
- No need to say.</font>

421
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:25,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see it in your eyes.
- Beautiful.</font>

422
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only beautiful if it works.</font>

423
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set the sail.</font>

424
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki! The sail!</font>

425
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She'll sink.
- No, she bloody won't.</font>

426
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have pretended
to build such a boat.</font>

427
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beyond my humble capabilities.</font>

428
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll set the sail.</font>

429
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Ragnar.</font>

430
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.</font>

431
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, man.</font>

432
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it runs on its cool keel.</font>

433
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:48,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

434
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:53,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you believe me?
I told you I could do it!</font>

435
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's all up to you, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>
