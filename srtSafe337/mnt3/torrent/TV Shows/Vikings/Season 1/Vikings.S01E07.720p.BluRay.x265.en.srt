1
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make way there! Come on!
Make way! Make way!</font>

2
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother!</font>

3
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother! Where are you?</font>

4
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aethelwulf?</font>

5
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God you are come.</font>

6
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What on Earth made you
think I would not, sire?</font>

7
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I never doubted you,
but others...</font>

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our own youngest
brother fled to Mercia.</font>

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was always
the runt of the litter.</font>

10
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our parents should've
drowned him at birth.</font>

11
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the heathens now?</font>

12
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one, perhaps two days away.</font>

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your forces
are ready and armed?</font>

14
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, if you are
ready to lead them.</font>

15
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would regard it
a great honor, sire,</font>

16
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">to defend our kingdom
and our homeland.</font>

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's no man better,
Lord Aethelwulf.</font>

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">The poets sing your battle
praises in the halls.</font>

19
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because I paid them.</font>

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you paid them,
they'd sing your praises too.</font>

21
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's poets for you.</font>

22
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lady, pray, have you
no time for laughter?</font>

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, My Lord Aethelwulf,
only for fear.</font>

24
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">How soon will they come?</font>

25
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon enough.</font>

26
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope so. I can't
wait for Valhalla.</font>

27
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good day to you, folk.
What is the problem here?</font>

28
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is her.</font>

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">What has she done?</font>

30
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has had a child,
the boy in her arms.</font>

31
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of it?</font>

32
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not my child.</font>

33
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried for many years to have
children but without success.</font>

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, just over a year ago,
a young man came to the door.</font>

35
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember the day.
I was making a loom.</font>

36
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young man said
his name was Ríg.</font>

37
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave us some good advice on our
work and stayed at our house.</font>

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">After three days, he left,</font>

39
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then nine months later,
she gave birth to a son.</font>

40
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose child is it?</font>

41
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not know, My Lady.</font>

42
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were all in the same bed.</font>

43
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was too scared... You see?
She is not an honest woman.</font>

44
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had sex with Ríg</font>

45
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">and could not bring herself
to tell me the truth!</font>

46
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who this Ríg was?</font>

47
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he was just a young man.</font>

48
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the contrary.</font>

49
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know from our ancient stories</font>

50
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Ríg is another
name for Heimdall.</font>

51
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The god Heimdall? My Lady!</font>

52
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the god Heimdall!</font>

53
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are fortunate that he chose
your household to appear in.</font>

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just a story.</font>

55
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our whole lives
are just stories.</font>

56
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be ashamed
you did not trust your wife,</font>

57
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">despite the joy and comfort
she has brought you,</font>

58
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the fact that a god chose
you of all people to visit.</font>

59
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not punish her,</font>

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">but rejoice with her,
drink wine with her,</font>

61
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sacrifice one of your
animals to Heimdall, the god.</font>

62
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I hear you have harmed
this woman or this child,</font>

63
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will answer for it to me.</font>

64
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems they intend
to stay here a while.</font>

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had not expected that.</font>

66
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, why don't we attack?</font>

67
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have a strong position.</font>

68
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps if we can make them leave
their position and attack us.</font>

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could we
force them to do that?</font>

70
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're scavengers,
little more than beasts.</font>

71
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must be able
to out-think them.</font>

72
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we leave it much longer,
they'll be even better dug-in.</font>

73
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, if a wolf comes
into your sheep fold,</font>

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">you don't try to out-think it.</font>

75
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go in and drive
it away or kill it!</font>

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you argue with me?</font>

77
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Aethelwulf, forgive us.
We only meant...</font>

78
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you meant.</font>

79
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You meant that you're already
greater warriors than I am,</font>

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">although only yesterday
you were still green,</font>

81
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">sucking on your
mothers' breasts.</font>

82
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go do your jobs. Set up camp.</font>

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see them up there?</font>

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I can see them.</font>

85
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">What're we waiting for?</font>

86
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">To see what they'll do.</font>

87
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you want to hand
them the initiative?</font>

88
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't afford to lose half our
men by being stupid and attacking.</font>

89
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wait until the odds
are in our favor.</font>

90
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...</font>

91
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awake! Awake! Under attack!</font>

92
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arm yourselves!</font>

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise! Rise!</font>

94
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw! Throw!</font>

95
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin!</font>

96
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're on us! Weapons!</font>

97
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord! We're being attacked!</font>

98
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

99
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

100
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Lord Aethelwulf,
brother of King Aelle.</font>

101
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the brother of the
King, yet you lead his army?</font>

102
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

103
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he send you to
fight all his battles?</font>

104
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the bedroom too?</font>

105
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar! Come and see!</font>

106
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their iron is stronger
and better than ours.</font>

107
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we've captured a
dozen of their horses.</font>

108
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm hungry already.</font>

109
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">What ails you, my friend?</font>

110
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods won't lift my curse.</font>

111
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am fated to live forever
on this miserable Earth.</font>

112
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this?</font>

113
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">This?</font>

114
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the King's brother.</font>

115
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say?</font>

116
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we go visit the King?</font>

117
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">God help us!
My brother defeated, dead.</font>

118
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">God help Northumbria.</font>

119
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, we do not know
if your brother is dead.</font>

120
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we do know, My Lord,
that he was defeated!</font>

121
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these barbarians,
these savages?</font>

122
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have they
come to torment us?</font>

123
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, some learned
and wise men say</font>

124
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">that these Northmen have
been sent here by God...</font>

125
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">To punish our people for their
many sins and transgressions.</font>

126
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we have departed from
the path of righteousness</font>

127
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">that our lord set out, so now he
is holding us to terrible account.</font>

128
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, sire,</font>

129
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what if God has not sent these
Northmen here to plague us?</font>

130
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then who has, pray?</font>

131
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could it not, sire, rather
be the work of the devil?</font>

132
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on then, My Lord.</font>

133
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your advice?</font>

134
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">My advice, sire, is that, as we
are facing the forces of Satan,</font>

135
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">we must resist
them at all costs.</font>

136
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even at the cost of all
our lives if necessary.</font>

137
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">For evil cannot be accommodated
nor yet ever bargained with.</font>

138
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

139
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, if I might speak?</font>

140
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put it to you that it might be</font>

141
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">that these pagans have come
here by their own account,</font>

142
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they are neither
of God nor the devil.</font>

143
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are just savage men</font>

144
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">more interested in robbery and plunder
than in matters of the spirit.</font>

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what is your advice?
Listen to him.</font>

146
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, since they
have come for gain,</font>

147
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">then let us offer them enough money
or whatever else they desire</font>

148
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go away and
leave us in peace!</font>

149
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame! Shame on you!
Shame on you!</font>

150
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is right!
Why waste more blood?</font>

151
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pay them off! Foolish!</font>

152
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lords, let me think
on it just a little while.</font>

153
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, let it be known</font>

154
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have sent envoys out
to raise more men to arms</font>

155
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">for our use if need be.</font>

156
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long live the King!</font>

157
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contend, O Lord, against
those who contend with me.</font>

158
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight against those
who fight against me.</font>

159
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draw the spear and javelin
against my pursuers.</font>

160
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say to my soul,
"I am your salvation."</font>

161
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, they are here.</font>

162
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greetings.</font>

163
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Aelle invites your leader to
meet him in his villa to talk.</font>

164
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is your leader?</font>

165
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King did not know that
his brother was still alive.</font>

166
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would like to talk to you
about what he can give you</font>

167
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">to set his brother free.</font>

168
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you accept
the King's invitation?</font>

169
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

170
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should attack
while they are weak.</font>

171
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long will it take them
to raise another army?</font>

172
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Attack, attack, attack!"
That's all he ever says.</font>

173
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to talk to the King.</font>

174
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is there to talk about?</font>

175
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine the treasures the
King keeps in his household.</font>

176
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want them.</font>

177
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see how he lives,
what manner of men they are,</font>

178
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm hungry.</font>

179
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me,</font>

180
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we agree to
walk into his house,</font>

181
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">he can kill each
and every one of us.</font>

182
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">You forget,
we hold his brother hostage.</font>

183
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should he care
about his brother?</font>

184
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I not care about mine?</font>

185
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming.</font>

186
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord Eadric.</font>

187
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, this man
is Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

188
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">his brother Rollo,</font>

189
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their companions.</font>

190
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

191
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've heard that name before.</font>

192
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are pleased you have
decided to talk to us.</font>

193
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps, sire, you should
invite them to eat first.</font>

194
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

195
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us feast
together and then talk.</font>

196
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King!</font>

197
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

198
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">may I present my wife,
Ealswith, and my son, Egbert.</font>

199
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

200
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on now.</font>

201
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need more.</font>

202
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.</font>

203
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

204
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we talk, King?</font>

205
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

206
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want</font>

207
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the safe return of my brother
and for leaving my kingdom?</font>

208
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he a priest?</font>

209
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a bishop of our church,</font>

210
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man of God.</font>

211
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, too, have a man
of God at home.</font>

212
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two thousand pounds
in gold and silver.</font>

213
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

214
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much?</font>

215
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two thousand pounds.</font>

216
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not think I heard you
properly, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

217
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

218
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two thousand pounds in weight.</font>

219
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the price.</font>

220
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree to the terms.</font>

221
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

222
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, you must
return my brother.</font>

223
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we receive payment,
you shall have your brother.</font>

224
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must give me time to
collect such a vast amount.</font>

225
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the meantime,</font>

226
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and your men
must remain in your camp</font>

227
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make no further attacks on
my people or their property.</font>

228
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed.</font>

229
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire! How can we trust
the word of a pagan?</font>

230
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me baptize one of them.</font>

231
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is one further condition.</font>

232
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I desire that either you
or one of your companions</font>

233
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">agrees to be
baptized into our faith.</font>

234
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way, I can make peace with
a friend and fellow Christian,</font>

235
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not an enemy.</font>

236
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want one of us to
become Christian? Yes.</font>

237
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tostig!</font>

238
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be Christian.</font>

239
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lady Lagertha,</font>

240
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you can
find it in your heart</font>

241
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">to speak to the wife
of the late Earl.</font>

242
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Hello, Siggy.
Please sit down and join us.</font>

243
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Earl Haraldson
tried to kill my father.</font>

244
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. And if he had succeeded,</font>

245
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would be standing
where Siggy's standing now.</font>

246
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:52,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what would you
like me to say to her?</font>

247
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would ask her to sit down.</font>

248
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

249
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you?</font>

250
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is what I can do for you.</font>

251
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to serve you.</font>

252
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not necessary.</font>

253
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember very well how I
served the father of my church,</font>

254
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it did me no harm.</font>

255
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I found in service
a great freedom and honor.</font>

256
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I accepted that I
should forget about myself</font>

257
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">and serve Father Cuthbert,</font>

258
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, then I became happy.</font>

259
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's really what you want,
I accept your offer.</font>

260
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

261
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your daughter
are now under my protection,</font>

262
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will never
treat you as a servant.</font>

263
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">O Lord, Holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,</font>

264
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">expel the devil and
his kin from this person,</font>

265
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the head, from the hair,
from the brain, from the brow,</font>

266
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the ears,
from the nostrils,</font>

267
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the mouth,
from beneath the tongue,</font>

268
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the throat, from the neck,</font>

269
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the chest, from the heart,</font>

270
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the entire
interior of the body,</font>

271
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the thoughts, from the
words, and from the deeds,</font>

272
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:08,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the name of
Jesus Christ, our Lord.</font>

273
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

274
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I anoint thee</font>

275
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</font>

276
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

277
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I now pronounce
you baptized and born again</font>

278
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the new
Christian name of Rolf.</font>

279
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord
bless you and keep you</font>

280
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">from this day hence and forever.</font>

281
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

282
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have witnessed
a true miracle.</font>

283
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I ask you to
fulfill your promises.</font>

284
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Return to your ships and
await your payment in peace.</font>

285
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed, Ragnar Lothbrok?</font>

286
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

287
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep.</font>

288
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here beside me, daughter.</font>

289
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">What worries you?</font>

290
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear for father so far away.</font>

291
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our lives are fated, Gyda.
We all have to accept that.</font>

292
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel it moving
underneath my hand.</font>

293
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm. He has a strong kick.</font>

294
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:55,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">He? Are you so sure it's a boy?</font>

295
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">A long time ago,
the Seer prophesized</font>

296
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your father
would have many sons.</font>

297
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how I know it's a boy.</font>

298
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now sleep.</font>

299
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won again.</font>

300
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Rolf.</font>

301
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you, Floki?</font>

302
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing wrong with me.</font>

303
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not renounce the gods
in front of everyone.</font>

304
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a joke.</font>

305
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't believe it.</font>

306
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even know what
the old fool was saying.</font>

307
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter. Surely,
you've made them very angry.</font>

308
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be stupid.</font>

309
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you are the stupid one to
risk the wrath of the gods.</font>

310
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:25,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will you ever get Odin
to forgive you now?</font>

311
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're here! Come and see!</font>

312
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're empty.</font>

313
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move back!</font>

314
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reform!</font>

315
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">My men!</font>

316
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Regroup!</font>

317
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin!</font>

318
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valhalla.</font>

319
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many Christians
did I kill, Floki?</font>

320
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many?</font>

321
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think Odin is
still angry with me now?</font>

322
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

323
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems your brother, the King,</font>

324
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">does not care if
you live or die.</font>

325
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you let me talk to him, I will
persuade him to honor his pledge.</font>

326
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I not
just kill you now?</font>

327
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll have nothing
left to bargain with.</font>

328
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have this.</font>

329
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open!</font>

330
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the gate!</font>

331
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear before God almighty,</font>

332
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:13,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I declare war eternal on the
Northman, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

333
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to our Lord Jesus Christ
and to the Blessed Virgin,</font>

334
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">one day, I will
avenge myself on him</font>

335
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring him to
justice and to death,</font>

336
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">so help me God.</font>
