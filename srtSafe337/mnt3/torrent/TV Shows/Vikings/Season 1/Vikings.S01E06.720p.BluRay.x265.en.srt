1
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, this man says he has a
message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him go.</font>

4
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the message?</font>

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.</font>

6
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.</font>

7
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he is
a descendant of Odin.</font>

8
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,</font>

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.</font>

10
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">There would be greater shame in
accepting a challenge from a criminal.</font>

11
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would suggest
that I take him seriously,</font>

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I see him as an equal.</font>

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The challenge is declined.</font>

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Ragnar Lothbrok
appears in Kattegat,</font>

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will be put in chains.</font>

16
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,359
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Stones and bones.</i></font>

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">He searches for your death.</font>

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he desire to be Earl?</font>

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he kills you,
would it not be so?</font>

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.</font>

21
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him away.</font>

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar.</font>

23
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

24
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go away.</font>

25
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's leave here.</font>

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not
the only place for us.</font>

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is old.</font>

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you frightened of?</font>

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fight.</font>

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still too weak.</font>

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps that makes us equal.</font>

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.</font>

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is our way.</font>

34
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who sets the odds?</font>

35
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our fates are already decided.</font>

36
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe that,
and neither do I.</font>

37
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are wrong.</font>

38
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do believe it.</font>

39
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to bed.</font>

40
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to rest, to sleep.</font>

41
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I will.</font>

42
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always time to sleep.</font>

43
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking about our boys,
what they would look like now.</font>

44
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't. Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.</font>

45
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I must kill a man
for whom I have</font>

46
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">the utmost respect.</font>

47
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Respect?</font>

48
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?</font>

49
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is what I used to be,
restless, ambitious.</font>

51
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was right
about the western lands.</font>

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I always knew
that in my heart.</font>

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why didn't you tell him?</font>

54
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the moment that I
reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok</font>

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the moment that all my
friends, all my supporters</font>

56
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">would have deserted
me and joined him.</font>

57
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was impossible to do it.</font>

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's true our fates
have brought us together.</font>

59
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe he's opened
the western lands for me.</font>

60
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is my hope
after I kill him.</font>

61
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seer promised
you would kill him?</font>

62
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

63
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

64
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that's our first child.</font>

65
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.</font>

66
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starving.</font>

67
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like the smell
of them in the bed.</font>

68
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your clothes are
smelly enough as it is.</font>

69
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?</font>

70
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought a wife wasn't
supposed to nag her husband</font>

71
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?</font>

72
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings,</font>

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will beat you.</font>

74
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps that will make you show a little
life when we have sex in any case.</font>

75
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. I'll go.</font>

76
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait till tomorrow.</font>

77
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personal combat is
always thrilling.</font>

78
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok? I've
heard many people talk about him.</font>

79
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't talk about him.</font>

80
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's my father's enemy.</font>

81
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh...</font>

82
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord,</font>

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">High One,</font>

84
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">hear me.</font>

85
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.</font>

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your favor this day.</font>

87
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grant me your blessing
as you have done in the past,</font>

88
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will make
a sacrifice of my enemy</font>

89
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">if his death pleases you.</font>

90
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a sign.</font>

91
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot feel your presence.</font>

92
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Husband.</font>

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our sons' hair.</font>

94
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe at least in
them and in yourself.</font>

95
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look so worried.</font>

96
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a personal combat.</font>

97
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The combatants can choose any
weapon and shield they desire.</font>

98
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each man has two shields.</font>

99
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">If both are broken, there can
be no further replacement.</font>

100
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight, Ragnar!</font>

101
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, you can do it!</font>

102
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do it, Earl!</font>

103
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finish him!</font>

104
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is weak!</font>

105
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Odin is here,</font>

106
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:32,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting to see which one of us
he will take to his great hall.</font>

107
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I shall dine after all</font>

108
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the high table of the Aesir.</font>

109
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

110
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

111
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight I shall be
drinking with our boys.</font>

112
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him.</font>

113
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

114
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar.</font>

115
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

116
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

117
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

118
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

119
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

120
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

121
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

122
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take it!
- Take it!</font>

123
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it!</font>

124
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Ragnar,</font>

125
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have come to swear to you
my allegiance and fealty</font>

126
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">to you and your
family from this day.</font>

127
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leif, you are my friend.</font>

128
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, Torstein, and you,
Arne, you are my friends.</font>

129
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name?</font>

130
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tostig, Lord Ragnar.</font>

131
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you swear
allegiance and fealty</font>

132
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">to me and to my family
from this day forth?</font>

133
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">That won't be so long then.</font>

134
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">By my sacred rings, I swear.</font>

135
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I also have
a favor to ask, Lord.</font>

136
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this favor?</font>

137
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the next time you go
raiding, you take me with you.</font>

138
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not wish to insult you,
but the truth is you...</font>

139
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I am too old?</font>

140
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am old.</font>

141
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have been
a warrior all my life.</font>

142
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many years I sailed
with Lord Haraldson</font>

143
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fought battles
against the Eastlanders,</font>

144
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I watched all the
companions of my youth die.</font>

145
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And though I fought with
them in the shield-wall,</font>

146
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">never once was I
touched by a blade.</font>

147
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the friends and companions
of my youth are dead</font>

148
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">and feasting and drinking with the
Aesir in the halls of the gods!</font>

149
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">While I,</font>

150
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am forsaken,</font>

151
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">bereft.</font>

152
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I beg you, Lord,</font>

153
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">gift me the chance to die
with honor in battle</font>

154
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">and join my friends in Valhalla.</font>

155
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">This summer, we shall have
more ships to go west,</font>

156
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">for that is our future.</font>

157
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we return to England,
let's take him with us.</font>

158
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">All in favor?</font>

159
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

160
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no need
for you to swear.</font>

161
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have already paid a heavy
price for your loyalty to me.</font>

162
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless,
I will swear, brother.</font>

163
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to be true to you,
your wife and your family</font>

164
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">as long as your
good fortune holds.</font>

165
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will we ever be
equal now, my brother?</font>

166
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have you agreed to grant Earl
Haraldson such a big funeral?</font>

167
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he not your enemy?</font>

168
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was also a great man</font>

169
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">and warrior.</font>

170
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">He earned his
renown in this life,</font>

171
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now, in death,
he deserves such a funeral.</font>

172
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to show you something.</font>

173
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,355
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ I dreamt a dream last night</i></font>

174
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ Of silk as fine fur</i></font>

175
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,718
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ Now an Earl is

176
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,874
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ It is horrible

177
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she?</font>

178
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's one of the Earl's slaves.</font>

179
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he died,</font>

180
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of his slave women were asked,
"Who wants to die with him?"</font>

181
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one agreed.</font>

182
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants to die?</font>

183
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">These other servants
are preparing her.</font>

184
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,194
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ As the valkyries

185
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the body on the bench.</font>

186
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make our offerings.</font>

187
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need a drink, priest.</font>

188
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

189
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink!</font>

190
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's that slave girl,
the one who has chosen to die.</font>

191
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing?</font>

192
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is having sex with
the men who live in there.</font>

193
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one of them says to her,</font>

194
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tell your master I did
this out of love for him."</font>

195
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she will soon be reunited
with her master in death,</font>

196
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she will be
able to speak to him.</font>

197
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

198
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn, who is that woman?</font>

199
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call her the Angel of Death.</font>

200
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see my master.</font>

201
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is in Valhalla.</font>

202
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">He calls me.</font>

203
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me join him then.</font>

204
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot stay.</font>

205
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter
with you, priest?</font>

206
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to watch.</font>

207
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only death.</font>

208
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will stay, or my
father will hear of it.</font>

209
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

210
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:06,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail! Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!</font>

211
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

212
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar!</font>

213
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Earl Ragnar!</font>

214
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!</font>

215
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

216
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask permission
to light the pyre.</font>

217
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something important
to tell you, husband.</font>

218
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am with child again.</font>

219
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're a boy.</font>

220
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seer told me.</font>

221
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">By all the gods, my son,</font>

222
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have made me a happy man.</font>

223
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you come to kill us?</font>

224
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I do that?</font>

225
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Ragnar told you to.</font>

226
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is often
the way that the new Earl</font>

227
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">deals with
the family of the old.</font>

228
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar won't kill you.</font>

229
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you be sure?</font>

230
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother doesn't hold grudges.</font>

231
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's strange that way.</font>

232
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, even if we don't die,</font>

233
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will still shun
us like a bad smell.</font>

234
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'll make it
so we have to leave here,</font>

235
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though they know
no one else will take us in.</font>

236
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't.</font>

237
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if I vouch for you.</font>

238
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will force
you to go anywhere.</font>

239
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wouldn't dare.</font>

240
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want in return?</font>

241
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were once
married to an Earl.</font>

242
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you not like to be
married to another one?</font>

243
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

244
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean who?</font>

245
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

246
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pigs are fattening nicely.</font>

247
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like your mother.</font>

248
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold even in here.</font>

249
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait for
the spring or the raids.</font>

250
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to go to England.</font>

251
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

252
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I said no.</font>

253
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why? Because I said so.</font>

254
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be too impatient
to put yourself in danger.</font>

255
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you cannot alter my fate!</font>

256
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like your uncle</font>

257
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he doesn't
know what to say.</font>

258
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

259
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar, I have heard
many of your stories,</font>

260
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">but tell me, what is Ragnarök?</font>

261
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have heard mention
of it several times,</font>

262
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">but so far no one has
explained the meaning to me.</font>

263
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's show this ignorant
Christian what Ragnarök is.</font>

264
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the leaves.</font>

265
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">The twilight of the gods
will happen like this.</font>

266
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be three years
of terrible winters</font>

267
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">and summers of black sunlight.</font>

268
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">People will lose all hope</font>

269
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">and surrender to greed,
incest and civil war.</font>

270
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Midgardsormen,
the world's serpent,</font>

271
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">will come
lunging from the ocean,</font>

272
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">dragging the tides in
and flooding the world.</font>

273
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolf, giant Fenrir,</font>

274
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">will break his invisible chains.</font>

275
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The skies will open,
and Surt, the fire-giant,</font>

276
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">will come flaming across the
bridge to destroy the gods.</font>

277
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin will ride out of
the gates of Valhalla</font>

278
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do battle for a last
time against the wolf.</font>

279
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor will kill the serpent
but die from its venom.</font>

280
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surt will spread
fire across the earth.</font>

281
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">At last, Fenrir</font>

282
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">will swallow the sun.</font>

283
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

284
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where did these
Northmen come ashore?</font>

285
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't. What do
you mean, they didn't?</font>

286
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">They came in three ships, and those
ships are now sailing up the Tyne.</font>

287
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have ships that can cross
oceans but also sail up rivers?</font>

288
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">What manner of men are these?</font>

289
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they are sailing up the Tyne,</font>

290
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">then, sire,
we shall soon find out.</font>

291
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, My Lord Wigea, of
course you know all about them.</font>

292
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You accused them
of having supernatural powers,</font>

293
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why a small force
of them defeated you.</font>

294
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I merely said they
fought like demons,</font>

295
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">like men possessed,
with no fear of death.</font>

296
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike you, My Lord?</font>

297
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear death as
much as the next man,</font>

298
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have no fear that afterwards
God will raise me up again.</font>

299
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well said.</font>

300
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, all of you!</font>

301
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something
new to show you.</font>

302
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the serpents
bite these devils.</font>

303
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them also bite
those too weak and afraid</font>

304
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fight to the death
for their king and master.</font>

305
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,835
