00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every nine years, we travel
to the temple at Uppsala</font>

2
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give thanks to the gods and to offer</font>

3
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">them sacrifices for all they do for...</font>

4
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">For protecting us,
for the success in battle,</font>

5
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the rains that they bring
that grow our crops</font>

6
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, of course, for our children.</font>

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">This year I was not going to go,</font>

8
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">for there is too much to do around here.</font>

9
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:17,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then my unborn son
was cruelly taken from me,</font>

10
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:25,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it made me wonder what I
had done to anger the gods.</font>

11
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do Christians do about such pain?</font>

12
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Bible, it says
that all sorrows will pass.</font>

13
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any case, I've decided to go.</font>

14
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to take the children
for the first time,</font>

15
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">for it's important that they go.</font>

16
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

17
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?
What about me?</font>

18
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you come with us?</font>

19
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:17,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or perhaps you would prefer to stay
here and worship your own god?</font>

20
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:26,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'll gladly come with you.</font>

21
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
I would have taken you anyway.</font>

22
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift for the gods, for the children.</font>

23
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray for my daughter's recovery.</font>

24
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift for the gods.</font>

25
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray for health and prosperity.</font>

26
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gift for the gods.</font>

27
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask their blessings for my son.</font>

28
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gyda, you take the offerings.</font>

29
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the gods in thanks for my new baby.</font>

30
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

31
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar,</font>

32
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you not happy
that we're going to Uppsala?</font>

33
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I'm happy.</font>

34
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I not be happy?</font>

35
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we reach Uppsala,</font>

36
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">we shall ask the gods
why they give with one hand,</font>

37
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">but take away with the other?</font>

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did they make me Earl, yet kill my son?</font>

39
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:58,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?</font>

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arne.</font>

41
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,620

<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait to find out.</font>

110

114
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:41,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you sense the presence
of the gods gathering here?</font>

115
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have left their bright halls to see us.</font>

116
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are here for sure.</font>

117
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">They walk among us.</font>

118
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make their judgments on us.</font>

119
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when do we offer our sacrifices?</font>

120
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the end of the festival.</font>

121
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the meantime, we celebrate the gods</font>

122
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">and enjoy their presence in any way we can.</font>

123
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give Athelstan a drink.</font>

124
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priest, your cup.</font>

125
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:20,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mother, you came here before?
- Once.</font>

126
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did you ask the gods for anything?</font>

127
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
And they granted my every desire.</font>

128
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

129
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">These will all be killed as sacrifices.</font>

130
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six, seven, eight, nine.</font>

131
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven, eight, nine.</font>

132
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nine goats and nine pigs.</font>

133
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nine of everything!</font>

134
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, nine of every kind.</font>

135
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this?</font>

136
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for all the humans
that have been chosen.</font>

137
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come join us, priest.</font>

138
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink. Drink to the
nights and to the gods.</font>

139
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">And eat these.</font>

140
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:46,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a rumor today that King Horik himself
may attend the festival.</font>

141
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not a rumor.</font>

142
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I desire to meet him.</font>

143
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are great stories
and legends told about him.</font>

144
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

145
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to go out there, don't you?</font>

146
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stay.</font>

147
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you stay?</font>

148
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priest...</font>

149
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are surely not tired, Athelstan.</font>

150
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not on this great journey you have begun</font>

151
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">and must finish.</font>

152
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leif,</font>

153
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you let me go, I will fall again.</font>

154
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the gods will hold you.</font>

155
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priest, I have been waiting for you.</font>

156
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gyda, what is it, child?
- I am bleeding.</font>

157
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you are no longer a child.
Forgive me.</font>

158
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a woman.</font>

159
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let me cradle you
in my arms a last time,</font>

160
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">as I always used to do.</font>

161
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is hard for me to let go of you.</font>

162
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you do this, Thyri?</font>

163
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you understand?</font>

164
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to.</font>

165
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priests, stir yourselves!</font>

166
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You ignorant peasant!
- Wake up!</font>

167
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you disturb us!
Wake up!</font>

168
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!
Get out of the temple!</font>

169
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:38,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priests!
If you value your lives, stop this at once.</font>

170
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fools! This is King Horik.</font>

171
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:11,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan, I want you to meet someone.</font>

172
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:29,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Ragnar Lothbrok!</font>

173
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:36,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must tell you it is my privilege
and pleasure to clap eyes on you.</font>

174
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your reputation goes ahead
of you, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

175
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:44,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this because so many have told
me how you killed Earl Haraldson,</font>

176
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then built a new kind of ship,</font>

177
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:52,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">were the first to sail west,
and defeated a king of England!</font>

178
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:56,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I can hardly believe my eyes</font>

179
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you are standing right
here in front of me.</font>

180
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please.</font>

181
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Travelers and storytellers have described
how you came to your throne</font>

182
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">by defeating, one by one,</font>

183
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">the six uncles that killed your father.</font>

184
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my mother,</font>

185
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all my sisters and brothers.</font>

186
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also know how you
favor the poets at your court,</font>

187
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:28,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your people respect your law making,
your justice and your rule.</font>

188
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:33,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as a consequence, here, on this site,</font>

189
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the living presence of the gods,</font>

190
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offer you my fealty</font>

191
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my service.</font>

192
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accept your pledge with a glad heart.</font>

193
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you in return?</font>

194
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could join forces with me.</font>

195
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not satisfied with what
I have achieved so far.</font>

196
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to send bigger raiding
parties to the west.</font>

197
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, to plunder, but also
to explore new lands.</font>

198
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are other lands to the west?</font>

199
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a kingdom called Francia.</font>

200
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">A kingdom far larger, far richer</font>

201
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">and far more powerful than England.</font>

202
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan, come.</font>

203
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

204
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man has seen it.</font>

205
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a Christian monk in England.</font>

206
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I traveled to other lands as a missionary.</font>

207
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have heard of Christians and of their god.</font>

208
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are you still a Christian?</font>

209
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Of course not!</font>

210
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?</font>

211
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:06,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I share your appetite for new
adventure, Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

212
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will gladly join forces with you,</font>

213
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">since, as king, I am naturally not
in favor of individual enterprise</font>

214
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">by my earls or anyone else.</font>

215
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, believe me, I will be happy enough
just to have my name linked with yours</font>

216
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the poets tell the story
of how we Norsemen sailed west</font>

217
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">and discovered new worlds.</font>

218
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, come. Eat, eat.</font>

219
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:48,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why did you bother to come back?
- I was hungry.</font>

220
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many women have you been with?</font>

221
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't suppose you know.
- I do what I want here.</font>

222
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought we came here together.
- We came here with Earl Ragnar.</font>

223
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we came here together, but...</font>

224
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did come here together.</font>

225
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are together.</font>

226
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you keep pestering me?</font>

227
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am who I am and I won't change,</font>

228
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">not for you, not for my
brother, not for anyone.</font>

229
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">So leave if you want to.</font>

230
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">But one day I will be a great man</font>

231
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:50,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll regret leaving me
just because I sleep with other women.</font>

232
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really want to be a great man,</font>

233
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?</font>

234
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

235
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's where your brother is now,</font>

236
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:26,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no doubt he's already boasting
about how he sailed west, alone,</font>

237
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all he has achieved alone.</font>

238
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you weren't so stubborn and so drunk,</font>

239
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would be there, too,
but you weren't invited.</font>

240
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't even know about it.</font>

241
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have told you.</font>

242
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Rollo,</font>

243
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need me as much as I need you.</font>

244
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is, if you really want to be something.</font>

245
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok,
I drink to your good fortune.</font>

246
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the gods continue to favor
you and increase your fame.</font>

247
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">May they do the same to you, King Horik.</font>

248
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have done me the honor
of pledging your fealty as earl to me.</font>

249
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, then, if I seem anxious</font>

250
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make use of your skills and reputation</font>

251
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">as soon as possible.</font>

252
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">To do what?</font>

253
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:43,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a Jarl in Götland, Jarl Borg.</font>

254
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is an important fellow,
but he continues to claim he has legal rights</font>

255
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">over some of my land.</font>

256
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threatens me.</font>

257
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">He nearly invaded my territory a year ago,</font>

258
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">but at the last moment, he drew back.</font>

259
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, once again,</font>

260
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">he is making threatening noises.</font>

261
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:12,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how can I be of help in such a matter?</font>

262
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you be prepared to travel
to Götland as my emissary?</font>

263
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can think of no one
who I would rather represent my case,</font>

264
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your fame is widespread.</font>

265
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the issue is settled,</font>

266
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall be forever in your debt.</font>

267
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say?</font>

268
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

269
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you come here of your own free will?</font>

270
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

271
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first, I was suspicious of you.</font>

272
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sensed something,</font>

273
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:19,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I spoke to Lord Ragnar.</font>

274
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me your story.</font>

275
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you were a priest,</font>

276
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you were a Christian and
worshipped a god called Jesus Christ.</font>

277
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that true?</font>

278
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

279
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you still worship this god?</font>

280
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still, in your heart, a Christian?</font>

281
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

282
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:53,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Say again.
- No.</font>

283
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a third time,</font>

284
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">say it.</font>

285
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:06,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

286
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why you're here, don't you?</font>

287
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been brought here
as a sacrifice to the gods.</font>

288
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have come to tell you that the sacrifice
of this man will not please the gods.</font>

289
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:03,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is neither willing nor is
his faith acceptable to Odin.</font>

290
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">His heart is corrupt.</font>

291
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:11,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has not renounced his false god.</font>

292
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like your god
finally came through for you.</font>

293
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:24,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, one amongst you must agree</font>

294
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take his place tomorrow at the sacrifice.</font>

295
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, then all shall fail.</font>

296
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods, in their anger,
will punish everyone</font>

297
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">and withdraw their protection
from all of us.</font>

298
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not you.</font>

299
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before anyone else can claim this honor,</font>

300
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I desire to be sacrificed.</font>

301
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the sake of my family,</font>

302
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:29,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the sake of all of you,</font>

303
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">my friends.</font>

304
