00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far to Hexham?</font>

2
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not far.</font>

3
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

4
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

5
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar! Rollo!</font>

6
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's attack
straightaway.</font>

7
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">We attack tomorrow.</font>

9
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wait?</font>

10
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is
a large town.</font>

11
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have only a few men.</font>

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then surprise is
our biggest advantage.</font>

13
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arne.</font>

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What day is it today?</font>

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saturday.</font>

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we attack tomorrow.</font>

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
You will
understand tomorrow.</font>

18
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,879
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wh o we re
th e s e s tra n g e rs?</i></font>

19
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot say.</font>

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their ship was sighted
sailing up the coast.</font>

21
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a ship
unlike any other.</font>

22
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were not Franks then?</font>

23
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. They looked
very different
and used axes.</font>

24
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most were
as tall as giants.</font>

25
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, I fear
that these raiders
are the same pagans</font>

26
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">who attacked
the monastery
at Lindisfarne.</font>

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the letter
Abbot Alcuin wrote to you
of those terrible events.</font>

28
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">"They came
to the church
at Lindisfarne.</font>

29
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Laid everything waste
with grievous plundering.</font>

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Trampled the holy place
with polluted steps.</font>

31
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dug up the altars</font>

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and seized
all the treasure
of the holy church.</font>

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">"They killed
some of the brothers,</font>

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,396

with them in fetters,</font>

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">"some they drowned
in the sea."</font>

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do they come from,
these pagans?</font>

37
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say
from the north.</font>

38
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, wherever
they come from,</font>

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are not welcome
in my kingdom.</font>

40
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take care today.</font>

41
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take
any foolish risks.</font>

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't
get separated
from the others.</font>

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just going
to say the same thing
to you, my love.</font>

44
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of that talk.</font>

45
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting light,
and we've wasted
too much time already.</font>

46
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must wait
a little longer.</font>

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait?
What for?</font>

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wait!</font>

49
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">And listen!</font>

51
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hear
anything.</font>

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what are you
waiting for?</font>

53
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the way!</font>

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of God,
who are you?</font>

55
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have you
come here?</font>

56
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a place of God.</font>

57
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do not resist,
we will not hurt you.</font>

58
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell that to your
people, priest.</font>

59
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them
not to be afraid.</font>

60
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">God bless.</font>

61
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom!</font>

62
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knut!
Leave her alone!</font>

63
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave her alone!</font>

64
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you care
for this Saxon,
you bitch?</font>

65
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Knut?</font>

66
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Knut?</font>

67
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed him.</font>

68
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed him?</font>

69
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He raped
a Saxon woman.</font>

70
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he tried
to rape me.</font>

71
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did anyone else
see it happen?</font>

72
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a pity.</font>

73
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where were you?</font>

74
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold!</font>

75
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

76
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is there?</font>

77
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archers to forward!</font>

78
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shield wall!</font>

79
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down!</font>

80
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand!</font>

81
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brace!</font>

82
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open!</font>

83
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up into the
overturned keel.</font>

84
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clamber, with a heart
of steel.</font>

85
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cold is the ocean's spray.</font>

86
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">When your death
is on its way.</font>

87
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">With maidens
you have had
your way.</font>

88
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each must die some day!</font>

89
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hakon!
- Close the wall!</font>

90
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shield wall!</font>

91
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

92
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could this happen,
My Lord Wigea?</font>

93
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sire, I have
never in my life
seen men fight</font>

94
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">as these
northmen fight.</font>

95
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me,
there's something devilish
in the way they look,</font>

96
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">in their lack of fear
in the face of death.</font>

97
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, that is just
a counsel of despair.</font>

98
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are these pagans
not men, like we are?</font>

99
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do they not bleed
when they are cut?</font>

100
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do they have wings
and tongues of fire?</font>

101
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sire.</font>

102
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are they?</font>

103
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">We captured
two of them who were
guarding their boat.</font>

104
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't
understand anything
they said at all,</font>

105
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">except one word.</font>

106
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar.</font>

107
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar.</font>

108
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have
any family, priest?</font>

109
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had four brothers
and a sister.</font>

110
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all died of a fever,
like my mother and father.</font>

111
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only saved
because they had me
placed in a monastery</font>

112
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was just a child.</font>

113
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had too many
mouths to feed.</font>

114
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you are alone?</font>

115
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

116
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">God is my father,
so I am never alone.</font>

117
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does your god
look like?</font>

118
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can know what
God looks like.</font>

119
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be like
looking into the sun.</font>

120
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It cannot be done.</font>

121
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he did send his only son
to live on the Earth</font>

122
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he looked like a man.</font>

123
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin, Thor and Loki
are like men,</font>

124
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are they your gods?</font>

125
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">They aren't gods.</font>

126
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't exist.</font>

127
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn.</font>

128
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death was on its way
to take Kauko.</font>

129
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't grieve for him.
Don't pity him.</font>

130
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess where
he is now?</font>

131
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valkyries have
taken him home
to Valhalla.</font>

132
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right at this moment
he is...</font>

133
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is drinking ale
with the gods.</font>

134
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

135
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is happier
than even we are.</font>

136
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">With our boat and...</font>

137
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">These goods.</font>

138
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even so,
he was my kinsman.</font>

139
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must avenge
his death.</font>

140
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was done
in the name
of King Aelle,</font>

141
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and King Aelle
must suffer for it.</font>

142
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, he will.</font>

143
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the gods will it.</font>

144
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him,</font>

145
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's wetting himself.</font>

146
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kept your word.</font>

147
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took us to the town,
and I thank you for that.</font>

148
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

149
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to live?</font>

150
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to go
to Kattegat.</font>

151
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see
my father
return soon.</font>

152
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must return soon.</font>

153
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave your father
my word that I would
look after you both here.</font>

154
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not
looking after us.</font>

155
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">We look after ourselves.</font>

156
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot allow you to go
on your own to Kattegat.</font>

157
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father
would never tolerate
such a thing.</font>

158
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we should
go together.</font>

159
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">The three of us.</font>

160
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who will then
look after the farm?</font>

161
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what we are
about to receive,</font>

162
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">may the Lord make
us truly grateful.</font>

163
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

164
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have
some ale?</font>

165
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too young,
Gyda, to drink ale.</font>

166
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to make
a sacrifice to Thor,</font>

167
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my father's
safe return.</font>

168
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will you sacrifice?</font>

169
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You!</font>

170
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you, Lord?</font>

171
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

172
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it your will
that I am here
with these heathens?</font>

173
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it serve you?</font>

174
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

175
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for the first time
in my life,</font>

176
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am angry with you.</font>

177
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">You allow my brothers
to be slaughtered and sold.</font>

178
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this really your will?</font>

179
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time,</font>

180
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel lonely.</font>

181
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you, Lord?</font>

182
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you?</font>

183
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why don't
you answer me?</font>

184
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just an owl.</font>

185
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn.</font>

186
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn, wake up.</font>

187
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

188
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go to Kattegat.
All of us, tomorrow.</font>

189
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kattegat!</font>

190
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok,
my friend,</font>

191
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">how was your voyage?</font>

192
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Successful, I hope,</font>

193
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all our sakes.</font>

194
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Saxons attacked us
when we returned
to the boat,</font>

195
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">in great force,</font>

196
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we defeated them!</font>

197
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the man that
people say you are.</font>

198
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great adventurer,</font>

199
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am happy to salute
your achievements</font>

200
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to share
in the profit
of your raid.</font>

201
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't see
my friend, Knut.</font>

202
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

203
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knut is dead.</font>

204
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead?</font>

205
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he die in battle?</font>

206
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

207
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then how did he die?</font>

208
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed him.</font>

209
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed him.</font>

210
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what reason?</font>

211
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he tried
to rape my wife,</font>

212
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lagertha.</font>

213
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find it too convenient</font>

214
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you would
make an excuse</font>

215
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">to kill my friend</font>

216
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my agent
on your voyage.</font>

217
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you think
that you would gain
by getting rid of him?</font>

218
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't expect
to gain anything.</font>

219
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe you.</font>

220
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrest him!</font>

221
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord!</font>

222
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your wife, Siggy,
would have you
not done the same?</font>

223
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would counsel you all
against such actions.</font>

224
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no way
you could prevail.</font>

225
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki.</font>

226
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him away.</font>

227
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar! Ragnar!</font>

228
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You summoned
me, Lord?</font>

229
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I want
to talk to you.</font>

230
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, sit. Drink.</font>

231
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...</font>

232
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a delicate matter.</font>

233
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

234
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the brother
of Ragnar Lothbrok,
are you not?</font>

235
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

236
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">A spirited man,
your brother.</font>

237
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he a fair man?</font>

238
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he treat you equally
when you sail with him?</font>

239
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up to a point.</font>

240
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, but I think
that he likes to rule you.</font>

241
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that whatever he says,</font>

242
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">in actual fact,
he considers himself
to be first among equals.</font>

243
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I correct?</font>

244
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get the impression
that he wants</font>

245
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take the credit
for everything.</font>

246
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">For building the boat,
for sailing west.</font>

247
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to be the hero.</font>

248
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what
it comes down to?</font>

249
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">To him?</font>

250
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would he have achieved
what he has achieved</font>

251
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it wasn't for you?</font>

252
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say, Rollo?</font>

253
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not.</font>

254
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would have
been impossible.</font>

255
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as I am Earl,</font>

256
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok
can give you nothing.</font>

257
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, on the other hand,
can give you a great deal.</font>

258
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could, for example,
confiscate the treasure</font>

259
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you brought
back from England.</font>

260
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">And offer you
a goodly portion of it.</font>

261
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you
do that, Lord?</font>

262
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might.</font>

263
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Depends.</font>

264
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">On what would
it depend?</font>

265
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ambition.</font>

266
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to stand out.</font>

267
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to be
someone, Rollo.</font>

268
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want the gods
to notice you, yes?</font>

269
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">They would have
noticed me already.</font>

270
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, my friend.
And do you know why?</font>

271
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you still walk
in the shadow
of Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

272
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think it's time
you stepped out from it,</font>

273
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let the gods see you
for who you really are?</font>

274
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

275
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to say
hello to somebody.</font>

276
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my
daughter, Thyri.</font>

277
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is soon
to get married,</font>

278
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I must think
very carefully about
her future husband.</font>

279
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be
a man of ambition
and prospect,</font>

280
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">as you can understand.</font>

281
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to have two boys,
but they were killed.</font>

282
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the man that I choose
to be my son-in-law</font>

283
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">will hold a high
and special place,</font>

284
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if he were
my own son.</font>

285
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thyri, say
hello to Rollo.</font>

286
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

287
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

288
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget
about me, my love.</font>

289
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes.</font>

290
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is Siggy,
my wife.</font>

291
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Rollo.</font>

292
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is the brother
of Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

293
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Rollo.</font>

294
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have heard
a lot about you.</font>

295
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say that you
are a great warrior.</font>

296
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring in the prisoner.</font>

297
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That murderer!</font>

298
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free him!
Free Ragnar!</font>

299
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him!
He's in chains.</font>

300
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, boy.</font>

301
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all aware
of the sacred nature
of our duty here.</font>

302
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stand
before us accused
of the willful murder</font>

303
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Knut, my brother.</font>

304
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knut, as some
of you may know,</font>

305
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the bastard son
of my father.</font>

306
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I loved him</font>

307
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a brother.</font>

308
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked Knut</font>

309
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go with
Ragnar Lothbrok
to England,</font>

310
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">where they raided
a town and brought
back many spoils.</font>

311
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">And while they were
raiding this town,</font>

312
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok
took it upon himself</font>

313
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">to cold-bloodedly
kill my brother.</font>

314
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's easy to imagine
why a man like this
would do such a thing.</font>

315
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an ambitious man.</font>

316
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't care
to share his spoils.</font>

317
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he resents the fact</font>

318
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he owes me
loyalty and obedience,
as his chieftain.</font>

319
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a man who
does not believe
in our traditions.</font>

320
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a man
who does not believe
in our laws.</font>

321
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence! Silence!</font>

322
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you
have to say,</font>

323
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you stand before us,
and know that you
must tell the truth?</font>

324
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true that
I killed Knut.</font>

325
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, your brother.</font>

326
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I killed him</font>

327
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I found him
trying to rape my wife.</font>

328
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask all of
you free men,</font>

329
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would have you done
if you were in my place?</font>

330
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would have you
just stood back,</font>

331
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">encouraged the culprit?</font>

332
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you would.</font>

333
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if
I had've known
at the time</font>

334
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was your brother,</font>

335
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have carried out
the same sentence.</font>

336
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you seriously ask us
to believe your story?</font>

337
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can confirm the story.</font>

338
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the wife
of Ragnar Lothbrok?</font>

339
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am, Lord.</font>

340
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">How extraordinary that
you happened to be there</font>

341
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the same time.</font>

342
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband is lying.</font>

343
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are so
under his thumb</font>

344
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he has persuaded
you to lie for him.</font>

345
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">May Thor strike
you dead!</font>

346
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

347
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband
did not kill
Knut Tjodolf.</font>

348
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then who did?
I did!</font>

349
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed him.</font>

350
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stabbed him in the
heart when he tried
his best to rape me.</font>

351
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">A murder is committed</font>

352
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only witnesses
are a husband and his wife.</font>

353
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, we can't tell
who committed the crime,</font>

354
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they both
claim credit for it.</font>

355
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't kill
my brother.</font>

356
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you,
how could you?</font>

357
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed my brother.</font>

358
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok
killed my brother.</font>

359
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have proof.</font>

360
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a witness
to the killing.</font>

361
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say you are
a witness to the death
of Knut Tjodolf?</font>

362
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

363
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll swear this
upon your arm ring?</font>

364
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I was there.</font>

365
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw everything.</font>

366
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, who killed
my brother?</font>

367
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok
killed him.</font>

368
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">In cold blood?</font>

369
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Lord.</font>

370
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a good reason.</font>

371
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Ragnar Lothbrok
has sworn is true.</font>

372
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your half-brother was caught
raping a Saxon woman.</font>

373
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he attempted to rape
Ragnar's lawful wife,</font>

374
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lagertha, the shield-maiden.</font>

375
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">So unfortunately,</font>

376
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">you cannot punish him.</font>

377
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who has the key?</font>

378
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Bjorn.
Like father,
like son.</font>

379
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems I owe you
an eternal debt.</font>

380
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

381
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I look forward
to collecting it.</font>

382
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's drink
a toast to Ragnar!</font>

383
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">To his future
and his freedom!</font>

384
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

385
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">To friends
and freedom!</font>

386
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">To friends and freedom!</font>

387
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">To you, my friend!</font>

388
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never
be free of us!</font>

389
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you drink
with me?</font>

390
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

391
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you
for taking care
of my children.</font>

392
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good Christian.</font>

393
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to say
thank you.</font>

394
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did a fine
good thing, Rollo.</font>

395
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope the gods
were watching.</font>

396
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do
it for him.</font>

397
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it for you,
shield-maiden.</font>

398
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want
to believe that.</font>

399
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Ragnar!</font>

400
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see Haraldson's face
when he had to acquit you</font>

401
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then give you
half his hoard?</font>

402
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looked like this!</font>

403
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok?</font>

404
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am unarmed.</font>

405
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the children.</font>

406
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry!</font>

407
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

408
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:52,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stones and bones.</font>

409
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stones and bones.</font>

410
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do
you read?</font>

411
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Not so
impatient, Lord.</font>

412
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

413
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask me a question.</font>

414
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the
signs threatening?</font>

415
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

416
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a quarrel.</font>

417
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be violence.</font>

418
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bones and skulls broken.
I see that.</font>

419
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is Ragnar doing
sitting on the hillside?</font>

420
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">He searches
for your death.</font>

421
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consults the gods
to whom he claims
kinship.</font>

422
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who could believe
such a thing?</font>

423
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he desire
to be Earl?</font>

424
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he kills you,
will it not be so?</font>

425
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the gods speak?</font>

426
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do they ever stop?</font>

427
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods have always
been favorable to me.</font>

428
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">They allowed
your sons to die.</font>

429
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the gods</font>

430
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">really exist?</font>

431
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what he's doing.</font>

432
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's preparing himself.</font>
