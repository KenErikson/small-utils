1
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the gods
protect him. Always.</font>

2
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my Lord.</font>

3
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope your boy
brings you profit.</font>

4
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the last one, My Lord.</font>

5
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask you something?</font>

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I still your slave?</font>

8
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it matter?</font>

9
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It matters because I have
noticed that in your world,</font>

10
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">slaves are often treated
worse than dogs.</font>

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I treat you like a dog?</font>

12
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not my point.</font>

13
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Legally you could
beat me to death,</font>

14
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there would be no penalty.</font>

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else in your world
is subject to the law.</font>

16
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just the way it is.</font>

17
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man can rape his female
slave but not a free woman.</font>

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true that we distinguish</font>

19
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">between those
captured in battle,</font>

20
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our own free men and women.</font>

21
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any case, why do
you say "your world"?</font>

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live here now,</font>

23
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is your world.</font>

24
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've never seen
you try to escape.</font>

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am less and less
interested in escaping now.</font>

26
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if I could.</font>

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I would like
to be a free man.</font>

28
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it matters so much to you.</font>

29
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">It does.</font>

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you preparing for?</font>

31
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've watched you.</font>

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are about to do something.</font>

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have made yourself
very strong.</font>

35
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps not strong enough.</font>

36
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do the gods say?</font>

37
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know
about our gods, priest?</font>

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finish the fish.</font>

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">In silence.</font>

40
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the man who thinks that he
has descended from the gods,</font>

41
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">learn that he is human
after all.</font>

42
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're under attack. Gyda.</font>

43
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn. Get Bjorn.</font>

44
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this. Stay back.</font>

45
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan.</font>

46
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this.</font>

47
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What shall we do?</font>

48
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we run?</font>

49
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we stay.</font>

50
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father will be back.</font>

51
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are too many of them.</font>

52
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay strong. Be ready.</font>

53
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn everything!</font>

54
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in the house, my Lord!</font>

55
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father!</font>

56
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're hurt.</font>

57
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go now.</font>

58
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

59
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, please tell me.</font>

60
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to get to the boat.</font>

61
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming? Go.</font>

62
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quickly, Gyda! Come on, boy.</font>

63
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, I won't go without you.</font>

64
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, don't argue!</font>

65
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, I don't want
to go without you.</font>

66
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok!</font>

67
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right behind you. Now go.</font>

68
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, quick. Go, boy, go.</font>

69
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok! Show yourself!</font>

70
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show yourself!</font>

71
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one!</font>

72
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on.</font>

73
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help! Help!</font>

74
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you accept that
you are a criminal?</font>

75
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you are worthy
only of defeat,</font>

76
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">worthy only of death?</font>

77
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accept my fate.</font>

78
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me speak with my god.</font>

79
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

80
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry!</font>

81
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin,</font>

82
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of Lords,</font>

83
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father,</font>

84
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">help me.</font>

85
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">After him.</font>

86
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn the house!</font>

87
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back alive. Yes, Lord.</font>

88
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

89
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

90
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

91
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you see him?</font>

92
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Father?
He's there somewhere.</font>

93
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

94
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father!</font>

95
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he dead?</font>

96
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead, isn't he? He's dead!</font>

97
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he dead?</font>

98
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Lord.</font>

99
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seize his boat.
- Yes, Lord.</font>

100
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a criminal.</font>

101
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not entitled to property.</font>

102
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you come across
his family,</font>

103
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">bring them here,
so we can talk to them.</font>

104
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord Haraldson.</font>

105
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let him escape.
I will not forget that.</font>

106
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki!</font>

107
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki!</font>

108
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki!</font>

109
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

110
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must speak with Floki.
Is he here?</font>

111
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn?</font>

112
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father is dying.</font>

113
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helga, get the bark of the ash,</font>

114
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the garlic and the sage.</font>

115
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the sage.</font>

116
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">We make a paste
to put on the wounds.</font>

117
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, we must clean them.</font>

118
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only way to make
them clean is with fire.</font>

119
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn, get more logs back there.</font>

120
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">A knife...</font>

121
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must bid welcome
to our guest.</font>

122
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guest? You didn't tell me
to expect a guest!</font>

123
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Earl Bjarni.</font>

124
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a Swede.</font>

125
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my wife, Siggy,</font>

126
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my daughter, Thyri.</font>

127
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are welcome, my Lord.</font>

128
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. It was a very
hard crossing, I must say.</font>

129
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

130
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's very pretty,
my Lord Haraldson.</font>

131
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, feast with us.</font>

132
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit over here.</font>

133
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that you may get to know
each other a little bit better.</font>

134
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me,</font>

135
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">but why would they get to
know each other better?</font>

136
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they are being married.</font>

137
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's... It's arranged.</font>

138
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I?</font>

139
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will have no
regrets, my dear child.</font>

140
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will make you a good husband,</font>

141
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will provide me
with many sons,</font>

142
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">of that I am quite certain.</font>

143
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">The celebration
shall be later this year,</font>

144
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I shall return,
laden with gifts.</font>

145
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,</font>

146
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">please accept this as a
token of my affection.</font>

147
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, let me.</font>

148
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say, Thyri?</font>

149
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my Lord.</font>

150
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are very kind.</font>

151
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give that to me.</font>

152
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dedicate this blade
to the goddess.</font>

153
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Freyr.</font>

154
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wisdom might you give us, Freyr,</font>

155
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and healing hands while we live.</font>

156
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail to the Aesir.</font>

157
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Freyr, heal my father.</font>

158
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">For everything
there is a season,</font>

159
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a time for every
matter under the sun.</font>

160
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">A time to be born,
and a time to die.</font>

161
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">A time to plant, and to
pluck up what is planted.</font>

162
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">A time to kill,
and a time to heal.</font>

163
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary, mother of God,
listen to me.</font>

164
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not let this man die.</font>

165
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you?</font>

166
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an excellent match.</font>

167
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a powerful man,</font>

168
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's the cousin
of King Horik.</font>

169
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's old and he's ugly!</font>

170
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't judge a man
by the way he looks.</font>

171
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've struck a good deal. Oh!</font>

172
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll give us 20 pounds
of silver for her.</font>

173
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you care
for her happiness?</font>

174
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care for her security
and her future.</font>

175
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ours.</font>

176
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This marriage will bring us land</font>

177
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">and important alliances.</font>

178
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods must have seen
that we need them.</font>

179
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me nothing
of this marriage.</font>

180
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have treated me
with utter contempt.</font>

181
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't care!</font>

182
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped caring
about a lot of things</font>

183
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">when our boys were murdered.</font>

184
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">They died. You buried them.</font>

185
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for you, it was the
end of the matter.</font>

186
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for me!</font>

187
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were my sons.</font>

188
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bore them.</font>

189
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought them into this world.</font>

190
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched them as they grew.</font>

191
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I loved them,
just as I loved you.</font>

192
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">The killers,</font>

193
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">they dug a shallow grave.</font>

194
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And before they buried them,</font>

195
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">they cut their heads off.</font>

196
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they laid them
in the ground, they...</font>

197
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">They put their faces
against their asses</font>

198
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a sign of disrespect.</font>

199
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I ever find the man
who did that,</font>

200
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will...</font>

201
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took these locks of hair</font>

202
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">from their heads.</font>

203
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">See Siggy,</font>

204
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you have such knowledge,</font>

205
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">being married to a rich,
old man isn't so bad.</font>

206
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true?</font>

207
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here?</font>

208
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still weak.</font>

209
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his wounds are beginning to
heal, thanks to Floki's magic.</font>

210
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torstein.</font>

211
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar, see who's here.</font>

212
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar, my friend.</font>

213
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

214
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save me from these people.</font>

215
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know I was here?</font>

216
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

217
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only know Earl Haraldson
is looking for you.</font>

218
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Rollo who said that if
you're alive, you might be here.</font>

219
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:09,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why did
he not come himself?</font>

220
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he thought
the Earl's men</font>

221
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be looking
for him especially.</font>

222
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is no secret that all of
the crew are being watched.</font>

223
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I made sure
no one followed me.</font>

224
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's eat.</font>

225
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is good to see you.</font>

226
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You too, my friend.</font>

227
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Helga.</font>

228
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Helga.</font>

229
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

230
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't wriggle your
maggot in her face.</font>

231
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's taken.</font>

232
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

233
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard they burned
down your farm.</font>

234
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">They also slaughtered
all our livestock.</font>

235
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have nothing left.</font>

236
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are alive.</font>

237
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar is alive.</font>

238
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your children are alive.</font>

239
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have everything left.</font>

240
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also need to eat.</font>

241
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are already eating some
of your winter supplies, Floki.</font>

242
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I am ashamed.</font>

243
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods will provide.</font>

244
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">For everything
there is a season,</font>

245
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a time for every
matter under heaven.</font>

246
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">A time to be born,
and a time to die.</font>

247
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just eat your soup, priest.</font>

248
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes your god</font>

249
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">sounds a lot like one of ours.</font>

250
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did the gods keep me alive?</font>

251
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the question
I keep asking myself.</font>

252
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do?</font>

253
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do nothing
until I am well.</font>

254
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the boat?</font>

255
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haraldson has confiscated
the boat.</font>

256
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">His daughter is getting married
to a man from Svealand.</font>

257
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boat is her dowry.</font>

258
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki can always
build us another one.</font>

259
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Earl?</font>

260
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst.</font>

261
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

262
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">What for?</font>

263
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't come now,</font>

264
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise, you will regret it.</font>

265
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember inviting you
to my daughter's wedding.</font>

266
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lord, I assumed
you'd just forgotten.</font>

267
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I came anyway.</font>

268
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's to happiness
for your daughter.</font>

269
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">May she be blessed
with many sons.</font>

270
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">That could be you dancing
with my daughter.</font>

271
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I often think about it.</font>

272
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, I was not
fated to marry her.</font>

273
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that old man was.</font>

274
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

275
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should talk.</font>

276
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

277
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later.</font>

278
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let my daughter enjoy her wedding day.</font>

279
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence! Silence!</font>

280
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is time for the
husband and wife</font>

281
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go to
the matrimonial chamber.</font>

282
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you
want to talk about?</font>

283
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want your thugs,
like these fellows,</font>

284
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">following me around everywhere.</font>

285
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a waste of everyone's time.</font>

286
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I disagree.</font>

287
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you lead them to Ragnar Lothbrok,
it will be time well spent.</font>

288
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar is dead.</font>

289
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you swear that
on your arm ring?</font>

290
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

291
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why... I cannot swear</font>

292
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I have not seen a body.</font>

293
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have heard nothing,
and he is my brother.</font>

294
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sure in my
heart he is dead.</font>

295
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about his wife and children?
They too have disappeared.</font>

296
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I heard.</font>

297
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you'd had
them killed, frankly.</font>

298
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">By those fellows there.</font>

299
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why should I trust you?</font>

300
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you've already betrayed me.</font>

301
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't betray you.</font>

302
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told the truth.</font>

303
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you trust someone
who tells the truth?</font>

304
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me the truth now.</font>

305
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is,
you run everything here.</font>

306
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You own the ships.</font>

307
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You decide where it is we raid.</font>

308
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be a part of that.</font>

309
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be
on the outside.</font>

310
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to raid and fight.</font>

311
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I was born to do.</font>

312
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

313
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you must understand</font>

314
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will take time
for me to trust you.</font>

315
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I do not give
my trust easily.</font>

316
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can stay here,
eat at my expense,</font>

317
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">work on my boats,</font>

318
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">prepare for the season.</font>

319
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we shall see.</font>

320
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed?</font>

321
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed.</font>

322
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

323
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if Odin lives in Valhalla,</font>

324
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">is he the only god
who lives in a great hall?</font>

325
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there are many halls.</font>

326
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor lives in Thrudheim.</font>

327
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Freyr was given
the hall at Alfheim</font>

328
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he cut his first tooth!</font>

329
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nearby is Valhalla,</font>

330
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">vast and gold-bright.</font>

331
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every day,</font>

332
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin chooses slain men
to join him.</font>

333
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">They arm themselves and fight
in the great courtyard.</font>

334
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">They kill one another.</font>

335
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">But every night they rise again,</font>

336
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ride back
to the hall, and feast.</font>

337
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">The roof is made out of shields.</font>

338
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rafters are spears.</font>

339
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coats of mail
litter the benches.</font>

340
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wolf stands
at the western door,</font>

341
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an eagle hovers above it.</font>

342
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has 540 doors,</font>

343
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when Ragnarok comes,</font>

344
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">800 warriors
will march out of each door,</font>

345
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">shoulder to shoulder.</font>

346
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is Ragnarok?</font>

347
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then...</font>

348
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was the Earth created?</font>

349
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Earth was made
from the Ymir's flesh</font>

350
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">and oceans from his blood,</font>

351
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the titan was
thawed from the ice.</font>

352
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods, they made
hills out of his bones,</font>

353
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and trees from his hairs,</font>

354
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the sky dome is his skull.</font>

355
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">And out of his brain they
shaped the welling dark clouds.</font>

356
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how do you think
it was made, priest?</font>

357
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Siggy.</font>

358
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

359
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sure!</font>

360
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to warn you.</font>

361
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must leave at once. Today.</font>

362
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband, he hates you.</font>

363
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has shown me nothing but
respect since I came here.</font>

364
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rollo.</font>

365
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me.</font>

366
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away.</font>

367
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?</font>

368
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

369
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

370
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

371
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said that you
always tell the truth.</font>

372
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to have a little
trouble opening your mouth.</font>

373
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I could make that
a little easier for you.</font>

374
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will he be better?</font>

375
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's taking too long already.</font>

376
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few weeks' time your
father's wounds will be healed.</font>

377
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he is careful.</font>

378
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have patience, Father.</font>

379
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You must have patience,
Father." Shut up.</font>

380
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torstein!</font>

381
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

382
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found him wandering
around the marshes.</font>

383
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lost.</font>

384
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:57,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was visited in great secrecy
by Earl Haraldson's wife, Siggy.</font>

385
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me that her husband
had played a trick on Rollo,</font>

386
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">and imprisoned him, trying
to find where you were.</font>

387
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he tortured him.</font>

388
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tortured my brother?</font>

389
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

390
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Siggy is sure,</font>

391
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">her husband means to kill him,</font>

392
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Rollo will not,</font>

393
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">in any way, admit
to where you are.</font>

394
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a trap for you, Ragnar.</font>

395
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki.</font>

396
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have another favor
to ask of you.</font>

397
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to go in to Kattegat.</font>

398
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to ask for a
meeting with the Earl.</font>

399
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you meet him, challenge
him to a personal combat.</font>

400
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">With me.</font>

401
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him, if he refuses,</font>

402
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">shame will stalk him for
the rest of his life,</font>

403
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Odin will never
permit him into Valhalla.</font>
