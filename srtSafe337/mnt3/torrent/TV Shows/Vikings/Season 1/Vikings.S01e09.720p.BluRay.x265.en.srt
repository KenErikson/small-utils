1
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send a rider tonight
and he'll be back by morning.</font>

2
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't they let
us dry ourselves and get warm?</font>

3
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I stay like this,
I will rust.</font>

4
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of fellow
is this Jarl Borg?</font>

5
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no way to treat
guests, whoever they are.</font>

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially if they've been
traveling for days on end.</font>

7
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you the emissaries
from King Horik?</font>

8
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can tell you at once,
you're wasting your time.</font>

9
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my land, and I
want it returned to me.</font>

10
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all I have to say.</font>

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to make peace with you</font>

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">and come to some
kind of agreement.</font>

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then tell him if he leaves
my land, we can have peace.</font>

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not before.</font>

15
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you make
peace, Jarl Borg,</font>

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you insist on
humiliating him?</font>

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I invade and defeat him,</font>

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">will he not be
even more humiliated?</font>

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if he fights well.</font>

20
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any case,</font>

21
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sure that
he would relish a fight.</font>

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

23
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

24
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

25
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one who sailed west?</font>

26
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am surprised that
you've heard about that.</font>

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you surprised?</font>

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone has heard
of your exploits.</font>

29
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have we not offered our
guests dry clothes and food?</font>

30
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Treat these folk well.</font>

31
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give them ale,
let them dry out, feed them.</font>

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, you and I will
talk again, Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

33
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't eaten in three days.</font>

34
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?</font>

35
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have fears.</font>

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the Seer,</font>

37
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">ask if your fears
will come true.</font>

38
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.</font>

39
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it,
from what you said yesterday,</font>

40
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">that King Horik is
prepared to compromise</font>

41
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,</font>

42
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">which he still occupies?</font>

43
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is prepared to pay you</font>

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">to renounce your illegal claims</font>

45
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">of his lands.</font>

46
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You disappoint me now,
Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.</font>

48
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you would just
name your price.</font>

49
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">The land is priceless.</font>

50
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.</font>

51
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every piece of land has a
price, just like every human.</font>

52
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you don't understand.</font>

53
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a small plot of land</font>

54
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">on which you grow
turnips and onions.</font>

55
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,</font>

56
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and on this land, in the earth, are
minerals, things of great value.</font>

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why else would I
assert my claim?</font>

58
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Horik resists your claim,</font>

59
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">but still, in good faith,</font>

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">he is willing to
settle with you.</font>

61
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you will name
a reasonable price.</font>

62
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.</font>

63
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then,</font>

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">it seems I am done.</font>

65
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, please, sit
down, sit down.</font>

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see if we can
find another way.</font>

67
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you have in mind?</font>

68
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if my claim
was acknowledged,</font>

69
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was willing
to lease the land</font>

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">back to the King
during his lifetime?</font>

71
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what if we deferred
judgment on ownership,</font>

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">but shared the mineral rights?</font>

73
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say?</font>

74
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we start negotiating
in this manner?</font>

75
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

76
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have not been
given the authority to</font>

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">negotiate in this manner.</font>

78
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean King Horik sent you
here with nothing but a demand?</font>

79
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet he speaks of peace!</font>

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
what is in his mind.</font>

81
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then,
maybe you should ask him.</font>

82
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me make a suggestion.</font>

83
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you send
one of your men back</font>

84
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy?</font>

85
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think that will work.</font>

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Your messenger
will take several days.</font>

87
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, in the meantime,
why don't you and</font>

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">your men go and visit
our famous ash tree?</font>

89
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is famous not
only for its size,</font>

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">but because it
never loses its leaves,</font>

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">summer or winter.</font>

92
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people even
say it's Yggdrasil,</font>

93
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">the tree that holds up the sky.</font>

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will
provide you an escort.</font>

95
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only have one
very small request.</font>

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like one
of your men to stay</font>

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">behind here as
a kind of security.</font>

98
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand, I hope?</font>

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother Rollo
will stay behind.</font>

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floki!</font>

101
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how long must we travel?</font>

102
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can take us three
days to reach the tree.</font>

103
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like rain.</font>

104
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have you come?</font>

106
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am frightened for my husband.</font>

107
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?</font>

108
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.</font>

109
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens in your dreams?</font>

110
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark shapes come to me at night.</font>

111
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monstrous forms.</font>

112
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I wake,</font>

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">they skulk in the
shadows, shapeless,</font>

114
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.</font>

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes.</font>

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shadows come
from Hel's hall.</font>

117
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.</font>

118
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it that they want?</font>

119
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">To take something from you.</font>

120
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life?</font>

121
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, something far more
important to you than that.</font>

122
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband's life?</font>

123
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

124
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why must you all force me up</font>

125
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and unearth me to sorrows?</font>

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband is in danger,</font>

127
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not for his life.</font>

128
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is in danger
from the magical world.</font>

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

130
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me.</font>

131
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!</font>

132
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Rollo,</font>

133
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">how do you get on
with your brother?</font>

134
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get along fine.</font>

135
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't we?</font>

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">No reason.</font>

137
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not all brothers
get on so well.</font>

138
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that from
personal experience.</font>

139
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

140
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, too, had a brother.</font>

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved him.</font>

142
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.</font>

143
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">We fought together
in the shield-wall.</font>

144
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shared the same women.</font>

145
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my father was
killed, there was</font>

146
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">fierce competition to
replace him as Jarl.</font>

147
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">And although I
was his eldest son,</font>

148
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was not sure I
was going to succeed.</font>

149
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, I was elected
at the thing.</font>

150
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a feast to celebrate.</font>

151
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife was there.</font>

152
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">My young, beautiful wife.</font>

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd just gotten married.</font>

154
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all the others who had
stood for election against me.</font>

155
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother poisoned them</font>

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">all.</font>

157
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only survived because</font>

158
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from</font>

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and drained it herself
in celebration.</font>

160
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will never forget her screams.</font>

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my wife's screams that will</font>

162
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">haunt me for
the rest of my life.</font>

163
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother denied responsibility,
but his guilt was too obvious.</font>

164
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I blinded him
with my own hands,</font>

165
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I burned him alive.</font>

166
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although he laughed
while he was burning.</font>

167
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I know about
the love between brothers.</font>

168
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar would
never do such a thing.</font>

169
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not.</font>

170
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, your brother is different.</font>

171
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother's a great man,</font>

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">a great warrior.</font>

173
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">As am I.</font>

174
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you are.</font>

175
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet I've never heard of you.</font>

176
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

177
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our camp is set up over here.</font>

178
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's some excellent fishing
upstream, under the waterfall.</font>

179
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will go.</font>

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I also,</font>

181
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">for everybody knows...</font>

182
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three eyes are better than one.</font>

183
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! Look away!</font>

184
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you? Look away at once!</font>

185
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we supposed
to be looking at?</font>

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm blind! See? I
can't see anything!</font>

187
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arne!</font>

188
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You're going
to try to kill us</font>

189
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">for protecting the
reputation of our mistress?</font>

190
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame on you!</font>

191
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We came upon your
mistress by chance.</font>

192
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are strangers here,</font>

193
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">traveling to the great ash
tree, guests of Jarl Borg.</font>

194
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jarl Borg? Then why didn't
you say so at once?</font>

195
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will just return
to our horses then.</font>

196
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You spied on me.</font>

197
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">We meant no harm.</font>

198
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say they are
guests of Jarl Borg.</font>

199
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you alone?</font>

200
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

201
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I think Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.</font>

202
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you?</font>

203
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew that</font>

204
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">fresh fish was
also packed in salt.</font>

205
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, it's not our fault.</font>

206
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just saw her bathing.
What were we supposed to do?</font>

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fish.</font>

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not see her, Ragnar.</font>

209
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you get your cheek slashed,</font>

210
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I'm supposed
to apologize</font>

211
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you two staring
at a naked body?</font>

212
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what she said.</font>

213
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she, anyway, to put such
a high price on her nakedness?</font>

214
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't ask.</font>

215
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm intrigued.</font>

216
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so intriguing?</font>

217
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us</font>

218
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">as some kind of test.</font>

219
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has set me a challenge</font>

220
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am up to task.</font>

221
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,</font>

222
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">than what I suspect is her wit.</font>

223
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell her,</font>

224
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invite her here to join us.</font>

225
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither dressed</font>

226
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">nor undressed.</font>

227
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else?</font>

228
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither hungry nor full,</font>

229
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">neither in company nor alone.</font>

230
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you remember
all of that, one eye?</font>

231
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did the Seer tell you?</font>

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said that it's true,
that Ragnar is in danger.</font>

233
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">From whom?</font>

234
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

235
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think?</font>

236
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he is in
danger from himself.</font>

237
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?</font>

238
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

239
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Earl Ragnar,</font>

240
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come to you as you desired.</font>

241
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither dressed nor undressed,</font>

242
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">neither hungry nor full,</font>

243
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">neither alone
nor yet in company.</font>

244
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I pass your test?</font>

245
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you an apology.</font>

246
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accept.</font>

247
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I offer you some
horrible salted fish?</font>

248
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very tempted.</font>

249
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get tired of fresh fish.</font>

250
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

251
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit, please.</font>

252
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask your name?</font>

253
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Aslaug.</font>

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on our way to
see the great ash tree.</font>

255
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are welcome to join us.</font>

257
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you come along, Aslaug?</font>

258
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Siggy, what is it?</font>

259
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's nothing.</font>

260
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I visited my cousin
a few days ago.</font>

261
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had just buried
her young son.</font>

262
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did he die?</font>

263
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day he was fine, and the
next, he caught a fever that</font>

264
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">made him sweat and cry out in
the night, and the next day,</font>

265
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">she put him in the ground.</font>

266
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if this is Yggdrasil,</font>

267
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">then it must be the same tree</font>

268
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Lord Odin once
hanged himself from.</font>

269
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">All things are possible.</font>

271
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:37,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,</font>

272
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">"wounded by a spear,</font>

273
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">"dedicated to Odin,"</font>

274
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">"from that tree of
which no man knows"</font>

275
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">"from where its roots run."</font>

276
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please.</font>

277
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look after my daughter</font>

278
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">first.</font>

279
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

280
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong, boy?</font>

281
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

282
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father is making
a fool of himself.</font>

283
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's enjoying himself in the
company of a beautiful woman.</font>

284
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's foolish about that?</font>

285
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some day you'll
do the same thing.</font>

286
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.</font>

287
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's
a good thing she's not.</font>

288
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, my friend.</font>

289
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father and mother
are a famous couple.</font>

290
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">They love each other.
Everybody knows that.</font>

291
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?</font>

292
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust all is to
your satisfaction.</font>

293
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feed me very well.</font>

294
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an important guest.</font>

295
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">We would like to keep you entertained
until your brother returns.</font>

296
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always talk
about my brother.</font>

297
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice do I have?</font>

298
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is your earl.</font>

299
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one would
you like tonight?</font>

300
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you take both of them?</font>

301
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to be
bribed with women.</font>

302
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you want, Rollo?</font>

303
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you really want?</font>

304
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,519
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fenrir, the giant wolf,</i></font>

305
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">could not be constrained
by any means known to man,</font>

306
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the dwarves forged a chain,</font>

307
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not from metal.</font>

308
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,</font>

309
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they forged it
from the things we cannot see</font>

310
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the things we cannot hear.</font>

311
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the breath of a fish,</font>

312
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sound a moving cat makes.</font>

313
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The roots</font>

314
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a mountain.</font>

315
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know?</font>

316
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I know!</font>

317
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">These things interest me!</font>

318
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the terrible tricks
of the god Loki.</font>

319
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">How he turns into a flea
to divest the goddess Freyja</font>

320
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">of her precious necklace.</font>

321
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's only a distant ancestor.</font>

322
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to ask about Jarl Borg.</font>

323
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't sell.</font>

324
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to make a deal.</font>

325
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in deals.</font>

326
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would make
it hard for Ragnar.</font>

327
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar will come to
the right conclusion</font>

328
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make the right decision.</font>

329
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any case, there is
someone else in Götland</font>

330
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">who looks after my affairs.</font>

331
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you care if
the negotiations fail?</font>

332
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

333
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am going to die.</font>

334
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you are not going to die.</font>

335
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seer might think that
he is the only one in Kattegat</font>

336
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the gift of prophecy,</font>

337
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's wrong,</font>

338
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know you are
not going to die.</font>

339
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should tell you the truth
about who I really am.</font>

340
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Princess Aslaug.</font>

341
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother was the
shield-maiden Brunhilde.</font>

342
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows the renown
of your mother.</font>

343
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I am not her.</font>

344
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am myself.</font>

345
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both my parents are dead now,</font>

346
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I did not know them anyway.</font>

347
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you come along with me?</font>

348
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I had no choice.</font>

349
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you do that?</font>

350
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I had no choice.</font>

351
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you.</font>

352
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's disgusting.</font>

353
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could not help myself.</font>

354
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I tell that to Lagertha,</font>

355
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">your wife?</font>

356
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to.</font>

357
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot love her
that much after all,</font>

358
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.</font>

359
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what people think.</font>

360
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I love your mother.</font>

361
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear to me that it
will not happen again.</font>

362
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you it
won't happen again.</font>

363
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

364
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go play.</font>

365
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

366
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

367
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

368
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan?</font>

369
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is so weak he cannot eat.</font>

370
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray to the gods,</font>

371
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">please, for him.</font>

372
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, no.</font>

373
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said no.</font>

374
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

375
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of lords,</font>

376
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">we make this offering to you,</font>

377
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">hoping you will
find it pleasing.</font>

378
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you try a little more?</font>

379
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gyda.</font>

380
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy!</font>

381
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you?</font>

382
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm carrying your child.</font>

383
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did the Seer not
promise you more sons?</font>

384
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

385
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">We welcome our
guests to this feast.</font>

386
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now tell us what you learned
from King Horik.</font>

387
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">What compromises is
he willing to make?</font>

388
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I not eat first?</font>

389
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he said...</font>

390
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

391
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

392
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will make no compromises,</font>

393
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">no deals.</font>

394
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">He say you must name
your price for the land.</font>

395
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or?</font>

396
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say "or."</font>

397
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems your mission
has been entirely wasted,</font>

398
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

399
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your men must leave
here in the morning.</font>

400
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you want to
repudiate King Horik,</font>

401
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">renounce your allegiance to him?</font>

402
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

403
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

404
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

405
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">War.</font>

406
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin.</font>

407
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, my friend, the die is cast.</font>

408
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Horik has
left me no choice.</font>

409
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:06,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must attack him and claim
what is rightfully mine.</font>

410
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother will clearly not
support me, but the question is,</font>

411
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you?</font>

412
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you fight alongside me?</font>

413
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together, you and I can
carve out the new kingdom.</font>

414
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Isn't that what you really want?</i></font>

415
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">The death of your brother and
the start of your own fame?</font>

416
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you say?</font>

417
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say yes.</font>

418
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will fight with you.</font>

419
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will fight with you
against my brother.</font>
