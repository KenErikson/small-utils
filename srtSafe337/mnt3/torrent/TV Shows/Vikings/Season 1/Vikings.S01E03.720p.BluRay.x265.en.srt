1
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:48,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello!</font>

2
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are Ragnar Lothbrok's son, Bjorn.</font>

3
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember you from the thing.</font>

4
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

5
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your father?</font>

6
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn? Who are you talking to?</font>

7
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just asking your son</font>

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Ragnar Lothbrok might be.</font>

9
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gone fishing.</font>

10
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Fishing?</font>

11
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gone fishing?</font>

12
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:26,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Fishing.</font>

13
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will he return?</font>

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

15
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:39,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">In which case, I must take
someone back as surety.</font>

16
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just in case.</font>

17
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case...</font>

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case your husband has not gone fishing.</font>

19
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! Come!</font>

20
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come!</font>

21
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to come with me.</font>

22
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't obey this order,
the Earl will never give you an arm ring!</font>

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come.</font>

24
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

25
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let's be on our way.</font>

26
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Where are you taking my son?</font>

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be quite safe, woman.</font>

28
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bid you all a good day.</font>

29
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did it, brother.</font>

30
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, brother, we did.</font>

31
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just hope the Earl sees it that way.</font>

32
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

33
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name?</font>

34
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan.</font>

35
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

36
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that place called?</font>

37
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lindisfarne.</font>

38
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:48,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">England?</font>

39
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

40
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was foretold that divine punishment</font>

41
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">would fall upon God's chosen
people for all our grievous sins,</font>

42
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so it has happened.</font>

43
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is why I am here.</font>

44
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

45
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are here because I spared your life.</font>

46
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you spare my life?</font>

47
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know yet.</font>

48
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok!</font>

49
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

50
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother Cenwulf here, beside me,</font>

51
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's dead.</font>

52
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

53
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leif.</font>

54
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">May God rest your soul, Brother Cenwulf.</font>

55
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,689
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In nomine Patris, Filli,</i></font>

56
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,567
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i></font>

57
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll drink well tonight, my friend.
Ah.</font>

58
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric!</font>

59
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank the gods!</font>

60
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not alone! Look!</font>

61
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've brought slaves to sell.</font>

62
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's more, woman.</font>

63
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">More things of gold and silver
than you and I have ever seen before,</font>

64
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">nor anyone else here in Kattegat.</font>

65
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome back.</font>

66
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you sailed west
across the open ocean</font>

67
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">and found land and plunder, as you promised.</font>

68
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let no man say anymore
that it is not possible,</font>

69
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we salute and praise you.</font>

70
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knut.</font>

71
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too late.
You missed the boat.</font>

72
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to tell you that
Earl Haraldson summons you</font>

73
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">to attend him in the great hall.</font>

74
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be a pleasure.</font>

75
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Ragnar!</font>

76
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming, Knut?</font>

77
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord,</font>

78
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was easy to take all of these things.</font>

79
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">The priests in the temple,
they had no weapons.</font>

80
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were like babies.</font>

81
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here is one of their priests.</font>

82
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">We captured several of them
to sell for slaves.</font>

83
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be true that there are many
more such holy places in England</font>

84
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">and other lands to the west</font>

85
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">likewise filled with such treasure,</font>

86
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to sail there will benefit us all.</font>

87
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:31,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you find this place of great riches</font>

88
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">when all before you had failed?</font>

89
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord,</font>

90
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">we were more fortunate than others.</font>

91
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had Thor on our side.</font>

92
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor.
Thor.</font>

93
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

94
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you were indeed fortunate.</font>

95
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you understand that
all this belongs to me,</font>

96
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">by right.</font>

97
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, me and Floki paid for the boat.</font>

98
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:14,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely we are entitled
to some reward, and my crew...</font>

99
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to pay you</font>

100
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you took these things
as easily as from babies?</font>

101
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what I've decided to do.</font>

102
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one of you can take
one thing from this haul.</font>

103
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One?
- Yes.</font>

104
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll still be richer
than you were before.</font>

105
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, all the world can see</font>

106
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">how magnanimous and generous is your lord,</font>

107
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially since you disobeyed me.</font>

108
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

109
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">what will you choose?</font>

110
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take the priest for my slave.</font>

111
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">The priest?</font>

112
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Granted.</font>

113
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you do that?</font>

114
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you give everything away so easily?</font>

115
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wasted our time.</font>

116
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never should have believed in you.</font>

117
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was looking for an excuse to kill us.</font>

118
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would we go to Valhalla
after such miserable and pointless deaths?</font>

119
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother, believe me,</font>

120
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is not the end,
it's just the beginning.</font>

121
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:07,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least we didn't give
everything away so easily.</font>

122
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your one thing?</font>

123
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">How should he ever find out?</font>

124
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You idiot!</font>

125
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would Odin expect us to
do anything so stupid?</font>

126
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have your Odin and I have mine.</font>

127
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go get drunk,
spend all this on whores?</font>

128
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:36,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure the Earl really finds out
that you stole from him.</font>

129
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a hoard is this!</font>

130
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a hoard it is.</font>

131
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what you've done, My Lord?</font>

132
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never doubt your power.</font>

133
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">With just a few words, you stripped</font>

134
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok of all his treasure.</font>

135
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's nothing to you,</font>

136
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:03,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are all power, all authority.</font>

137
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can have whatever you want.</font>

138
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them you'd come home.</font>

139
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father! You're home!</font>

140
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Little man...
- Did you reach the west?</font>

141
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">So,</font>

142
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">where's all the treasure you promised?</font>

143
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Earl took it all for himself.</font>

144
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I found it, and it filled the boat.</font>

145
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I believe you.
- You ought to believe me.</font>

146
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a priest from
the temple to prove it.</font>

147
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priest! This is my family.</font>

148
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Athelstan.</font>

149
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although he's a foreigner,
he speaks our language,</font>

150
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you?</font>

151
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little, yes.</font>

152
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong with your head?</font>

153
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we become monks, they cut our hair.</font>

154
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It marks us out.</font>

155
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're a priest, which
god do you like best?</font>

156
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is only one god.</font>

157
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, you can touch him.</font>

158
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are we keeping him?
- Hello.</font>

159
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've missed your smell and your body.</font>

160
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children are fine.
But I'm still a woman.</font>

161
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you wear this?</font>

162
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">All monks do.</font>

163
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at his feet.</font>

164
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan.</font>

165
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athelstan, we want to ask you something.</font>

166
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come and join us, priest.</font>

167
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

168
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to?</font>

169
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll enjoy it.</font>

170
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a monk.</font>

171
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have taken vows of celibacy.</font>

172
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot touch a woman.</font>

173
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never have.</font>

174
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't you like to?</font>

175
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It would be a sin.
- Who would know?</font>

176
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">God would know.</font>

177
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he looked the other way?</font>

178
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to sleep then with your god.</font>

179
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you
wanted? There are so many...</font>

180
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn, where are you going?</font>

181
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time for breakfast.</font>

182
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What age are you, boy?
- Thirteen.</font>

183
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen.</font>

184
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">The age my boy would have been.</font>

185
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men will soon be going
on the summer raids,</font>

186
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you looking forward to joining them?</font>

187
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dream of it.</font>

188
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already a good fighter,
like my father was.</font>

189
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I chose you, because
you're broad and strong.</font>

190
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's deep enough.</font>

191
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

192
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you burying all this treasure?</font>

193
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know anything, boy?</font>

194
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odin promises that a man will have
the use of everything he has hoarded up</font>

195
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">after he is dead and wakes
up again in Valhalla.</font>

196
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the hoard needs protection,
somebody to look after it...</font>

197
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:12,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this life and the next.</font>

198
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've already seen
enough of this life, boy.</font>

199
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, no more.</font>

200
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't like those in our
house to go hungry or thirsty.</font>

201
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am very curious about England.</font>

202
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it have one king who
rules over the whole country?</font>

203
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are four kingdoms</font>

204
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">with four kings.</font>

205
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You landed in the kingdom of Northumbria.</font>

206
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King of Northumbria is called Aelle.</font>

207
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a great king.</font>

208
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">A powerful king.</font>

209
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why did his men
not protect your temple?</font>

210
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you came,
we had no need to protect our monastery.</font>

211
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lived in peace.</font>

212
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone respected it as a place of God.</font>

213
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:26,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does your god need silver and gold? Hmm?</font>

214
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be greedy.</font>

215
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Loki!</font>

216
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have greedy gods, too.</font>

217
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">My god is not greedy.</font>

218
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">His kingdom is not of this world.</font>

219
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why is his kingdom so full of treasure?</font>

220
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian people give away their riches</font>

221
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the churches and monasteries</font>

222
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to save their souls.</font>

223
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are their souls?</font>

224
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to learn some of your language.</font>

225
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you teach me, priest?</font>

226
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:45,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you staring at?</font>

227
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Christian.</font>

228
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanted to see if
he was different from us.</font>

229
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you have seen him.</font>

230
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go about your own business.</font>

231
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just like us, but he is a foreigner.</font>

232
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. Come.</font>

233
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ragnar Lothbrok.</font>

234
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord.</font>

235
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do you find
your new slave? Hmm?</font>

236
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find him very useful,
as you will discover.</font>

237
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you want?</font>

238
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to sail west again.</font>

239
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have spoken at great length
with my Christian slave.</font>

240
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not a stupid person,</font>

241
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">however stupid his god is.</font>

242
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has traveled a great deal,</font>

243
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:31,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he has told me
that there are many countries to the west.</font>

244
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has also told me about his England,</font>

245
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">about his kings and his customs.</font>

246
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what are we to do with his customs?</font>

247
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has informed me of a large town,</font>

248
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">near to the temple that we raided before.</font>

249
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:52,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in this town, there are other
temples and surely other riches.</font>

250
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I was lying! There's nothing there!</font>

251
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?</font>

252
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">This town is clearly worth a visit.</font>

253
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us back our boat.</font>

254
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us go there and find out.</font>

255
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you have to lose?</font>

256
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any plunder we take will be
yours to do with as you please.</font>

257
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could go there myself.</font>

258
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you could, My Lord,</font>

259
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">but why put yourself in danger?</font>

260
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:26,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not leave it to someone
who has more experience of this journey,</font>

261
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">and someone who is more expendable?</font>

262
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

263
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:52,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sanction this raid on one condition.</font>

264
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">A warrior I trust goes with you. Knut.</font>

265
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will go with him for my sake.</font>

266
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, Lord.</font>

267
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take very close
care of your interests.</font>

268
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">O Lord, forgive me for what I have done.</font>

269
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not regret this.</font>

270
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's found a new way to navigate the sea.</font>

271
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find out what it is.</font>

272
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run away if you want.</font>

273
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the Earl's permission
to sail back to England.</font>

274
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to leave as soon as possible.</font>

275
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">How soon is that?</font>

276
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow.</font>

277
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all wish you success.</font>

278
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will sacrifice to Odin.</font>

279
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you not coming?</font>

280
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

281
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to come with me.</font>

282
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:20,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the farm, the children...</font>

283
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bjorn is still too young,
although he can help on the farm.</font>

284
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who is to be in charge?</font>

285
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">The priest.</font>

286
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will leave him with a key.</font>

287
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father! You cannot place a slave
above me, your natural son.</font>

288
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't regard him as a slave.</font>

289
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a responsible person.</font>

290
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Ragnar Lothbrok,</font>

291
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't do this.</font>

292
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think, Gyda?</font>

293
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mind. I like the priest.
Hmm.</font>

294
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it is decided.</font>

295
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">If any harm befalls my children,</font>

296
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:25,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will tear the lungs
out of your body, priest.</font>

297
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me this, Knut,</font>

298
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you really with us?</font>

299
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understand this!</font>

300
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">A war band lives</font>

301
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">and dies together.</font>

302
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:38,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you cannot trust the men
to either side of you,</font>

303
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">or in front of you,</font>

304
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are already a dead man.</font>

305
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am with you.</font>

306
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a mistake before.
I did not come with you.</font>

307
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:02,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I fear Odin will make
a bad judgment of me.</font>

308
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me, that's as important
as it is for you.</font>

309
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,509
