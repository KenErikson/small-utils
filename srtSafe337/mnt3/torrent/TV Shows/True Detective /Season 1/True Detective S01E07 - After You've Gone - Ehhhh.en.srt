00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:09,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like you're
doing all right.</font>

2
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father Time has
his way with us all.</font>

3
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:17,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you must
have pissed him off.</font>

4
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

5
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:28,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why we here?</font>

6
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a thing</font>

7
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:33,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">the State PD's asking about.</font>

8
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lake Charles murder.</font>

9
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, shouldn't it
have been in the paper</font>

10
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">to draw a line somewhere by now?</font>

11
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we can't trust them.</font>

12
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:46,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, I mean, if they're
gonna cover something
like that up,</font>

13
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:49,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">who knows what else
they've covered up?</font>

14
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you think?</font>

15
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you don't look
particularly healthy.</font>

16
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listening to you talk,</font>

17
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">your eyes, you seem</font>

18
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">kind of brittle, Rust.</font>

19
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:05,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of the last decade
I spent stone-drunk.</font>

20
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Functional, but hammered.</font>

21
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Went back to Alaska,</font>

22
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:13,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">spent 8 years working
fishing boats, bars.</font>

23
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I thought you didn't
like the cold.
I hate it.</font>

24
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:21,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I come back
here to Louisiana for
the first time in 2010.</font>

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why is that?</font>

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same reason
I'm sitting across
the table from you now.</font>

27
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:30,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man remembers his debts.</font>

28
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:34,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't dwell on the past.</font>

29
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it must be nice.</font>

30
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:39,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested
in whatever it is
you think you owe me.</font>

31
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't owe you.</font>

32
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">We left something undone.</font>

33
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to fix it,</font>

34
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:49,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've been working
on this for two years.</font>

35
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, myself.</font>

36
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:52,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never called you,
I never bothered you
with it...</font>

37
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, why would you?
Shit, man,
what did you do?</font>

38
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alienate every other
person in your life,</font>

39
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then finally
you came back to me
in the rotation?</font>

40
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, not for nothing,
but if you wouldn't have
clipped Ledoux back then,</font>

41
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:06,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">we might have got
the whole fucking
story out of him.</font>

42
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:10,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I think I'm
gonna finish this beer
and say so long.</font>

43
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm not much of
a drinker nowadays.</font>

44
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:15,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I hadn't had
a drop in 3 weeks
till I ran into you.</font>

45
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't need you
to drink, Marty.</font>

46
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to help me.
Why would I?</font>

47
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say you can't
account for your time.</font>

48
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got eyewitnesses
placing you</font>

49
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the Lake Charles crime scene.</font>

50
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got some
storage shed that you
won't let them look at.</font>

51
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.
Why not?</font>

52
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not shoot
straight with them?
You're innocent.</font>

53
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help them stop
wasting their time.</font>

54
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:39,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking since when
did guilt and innocence
define the State PD, huh?</font>

55
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:40,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come the fuck on.</font>

56
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know
the sprawl of this
thing, all right?</font>

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people I'm after,
they're all fucking over.</font>

58
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're in a lot
of different things,</font>

59
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">pieces, family trees.</font>

60
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way for you
to understand</font>

61
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I'm on to here
is for me to show you.</font>

62
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to come see what I got.</font>

63
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:57,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You know what?</font>

64
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I've
been very clear
with you, Rust.</font>

65
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were drowning,</font>

66
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd throw you a fucking barbell.</font>

67
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:09,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I ever help you?</font>

68
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you have a debt.</font>

69
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got some fucking sack.</font>

70
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that mean,
I have a debt, huh?</font>

71
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:35,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Means the way
shit went down in '95,</font>

72
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is on you, too, buddy.</font>

73
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:49,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you got to show me?</font>

74
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:06,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you packing?</font>

75
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">.38.</font>

76
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hollow-point?</font>

77
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

78
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:18,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'd do it.</font>

79
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never be too careful.</font>

80
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:45,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

81
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:48,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, there was
no physical evidence</font>

82
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">connecting Dora Lange
to Ledoux's place</font>

83
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">out in the woods,
meaning it probably
didn't happen out there.</font>

84
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody was in a hurry
to bring that up.</font>

85
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two... women and children
gone missing,</font>

86
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">all taken from areas
within a 10-mile radius</font>

87
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">of schools that were
funded by Tuttle's
Wellspring initiative.</font>

88
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:09,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">We establish a connection.</font>

89
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's in, who's out, you know?</font>

90
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:14,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, do people disappear
in equal numbers in
other parts of the state?</font>

91
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many schools
were there?
14.</font>

92
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I've covered
a surface area.</font>

93
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled runaways in state</font>

94
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">and missing persons,
and if you'll notice,</font>

95
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:26,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's twice as many
along the bayous.
I don't know why.</font>

96
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, someone should do
a study as to why.</font>

97
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you're just
throwing up stats.</font>

98
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was Tuttle
so interested in
the Lange case, huh?</font>

99
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember
Charlie Lange said
what Ledoux told him?</font>

100
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said there's a group
of men, sacrifices.</font>

101
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think Tuttle
recognized the scene.</font>

102
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why he came down
there jiminy quick with
a fucking task force,</font>

103
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:49,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's why
he tripped out when
I talked to him in '02.</font>

104
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, so what happened to him?</font>

105
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm looking around here,</font>

106
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't see or hear anything</font>

107
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't make this
all conjectural.</font>

108
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:01,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">1988.</font>

109
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accusations of child molestation</font>

110
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a preschool funded by Tuttle.</font>

111
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:09,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Name of that school
is Shepherd's Flock.</font>

112
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shuts down,
reopens two years later
on Pelican Island</font>

113
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the name Light
of the Way Academy,</font>

114
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Rianne Olivier went.</font>

115
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got
an enrollment list...
16 kids in the class.</font>

116
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them turned out
to be a young man
who'd just showed up</font>

117
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:26,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">for solicitation in New Orleans.</font>

118
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:33,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is 2010.</font>

119
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Toby Boelert.</font>

120
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goes by the name
of Johnny Joanie.</font>

121
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shepherd's Flock?</font>

122
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you asking me
about that place?</font>

123
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:58,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, after that place
shut down, there was a lot
of talk going around.</font>

124
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever see that reverend...</font>

125
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Billy Lee Tuttle, around?</font>

126
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:07,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I think so,
but who can remember
way back?</font>

127
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how it all started.</font>

128
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Memory be fucked.</font>

129
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:15,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I decided it all had
to be a dream anyways,</font>

130
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't remember if it...</font>

131
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd go to sleep,</font>

132
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">only sometimes I didn't
feel like I was asleep.</font>

133
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:28,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt like I was
still awake, but I
must have been asleep</font>

134
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I couldn't move.</font>

135
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... sort of see
under my eyelids.</font>

136
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what?</font>

137
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

138
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were men...</font>

139
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">taking pictures.</font>

140
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes...</font>

141
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">other things.</font>

142
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who were they?</font>

143
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

144
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had animal faces.</font>

145
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I decided
it had to be a dream.</font>

146
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:00,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had animal faces,
well, it had
to be a dream.</font>

147
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any other kids see this?</font>

148
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">One girl.</font>

00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember her name.</font>

150
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">She first started
talking about it.</font>

151
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she seen it, too, the faces.</font>

152
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not remember her name.</font>

153
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:16,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marie Fontenot?</font>

154
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

155
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:22,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever see any of
these men's faces?</font>

156
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once.</font>

157
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't all have
animal faces.</font>

158
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three younger men.
I don't remember them.</font>

159
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one.</font>

160
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had bad scars
all around his mouth,</font>

161
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the bottom half
got all burned up.</font>

162
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

163
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:45,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that man,
he was a dream, too.</font>

164
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:50,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think
he was a dream.</font>

165
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

166
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that you think</font>

167
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this hypothetical killer</font>

168
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">was, uh, an old schoolteacher?</font>

169
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or it might what,
involve State PD?</font>

170
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn. What happened
to you, man?</font>

171
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember him? Hmm?</font>

172
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

173
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You and I were on
the case in Erath.</font>

174
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl comes forward
and says she was chased
through the woods</font>

175
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a spaghetti monster
with green ears.</font>

176
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I think
that this is our man</font>

177
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the scars on his face.</font>

178
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got 3 references
17 years ago: that old</font>

179
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">revival church said
a tall man with scars
came through,</font>

180
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kelly Reider in the hospital,</font>

181
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now this hooker
from the quarter... Toby.</font>

182
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know who he is,
I don't know where he
is, I don't know where</font>

183
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">this whole thing
fucking starts,
but it ends with him.</font>

184
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you know
the little township
down around Erath?</font>

185
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that's
where the Tuttle
family is from.</font>

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, it used to be
a pirate hideout,</font>

187
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">then turned
into plantations
and whatnot.</font>

188
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had a very rural
sense of Mardi Gras,</font>

189
00:12:55,907 --> 00:13:00,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">uh, you know,
the men on horses,
animals masks, such.</font>

190
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Courir de Mardi Gras.
That's right.</font>

191
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, they had
an annual winter
festival.</font>

192
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Went heavy on
the Saturnalia,
a place where</font>

193
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Santeria
and Voudon all
mash together.</font>

194
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a look.</font>

195
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the winter festival.</font>

196
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blindfold...</font>

197
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">antlers, mask.</font>

198
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got these from a series
an artist did in Kenner,</font>

199
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">right after Katrina.</font>

200
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says he kept
running across these
"stick things,"</font>

201
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">as he called them.</font>

202
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look familiar?</font>

203
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think our man had a
real good time after
the hurricane...</font>

204
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chaos,</font>

205
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">people missing, and people gone.</font>

206
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cops gone.</font>

207
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:46,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he had a real good year.</font>

208
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you need me for?</font>

209
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got friends on the force.</font>

210
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have access
that I don't,
databases.</font>

211
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need case files.</font>

212
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need missing persons.
I need homicides.</font>

213
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:00,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need
title transfers,
auto and home.</font>

214
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a list of names.</font>

215
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna need
background checks,
tax records,</font>

216
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything we can get on Ledoux.</font>

217
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, man.</font>

218
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't have called
you and I wouldn't have
fucking bothered you</font>

219
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">if State wouldn't
have pulled me in on
this Lake Charles case.</font>

220
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you need help,
why don't you just</font>

221
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">give it to Papania and Gilbough?</font>

222
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they may be pawns
in this thing and not
even fucking know it.</font>

223
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Look, Eddie Tuttle is</font>

224
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">the goddamn senator
of this state.</font>

225
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">The late Reverend
Billy Lee Tuttle
is his cousin.</font>

226
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, it's
a fucking family thing.</font>

227
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I mean
when I talk about
the sprawl, Marty!</font>

228
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie Tuttle's the reason
that the Lake Charles thing
never made the wire.</font>

229
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, man, you have
some compelling stuff here</font>

230
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you might have something,</font>

231
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">but...</font>

232
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">all this... this...</font>

233
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The "sprawl,"
as you call it, which
I would call conjecture,</font>

234
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">this shit about
the Tuttles,
the State PD.</font>

235
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:53,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
how fucking crazy
that sounds?</font>

236
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like you've been
alone too long, you know,</font>

237
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you maybe told
yourself this story</font>

238
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">and kept drinking
until you believed it.</font>

239
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty...</font>

240
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:12,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had my time where I
wondered if this was
all in my head.</font>

241
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:16,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">That time passed.</font>

242
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

243
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:25,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened
to Billy Lee Tuttle?</font>

244
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:31,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something you're
gonna have to look at.</font>

245
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">No other way around it.</font>

246
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:40,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still take
your coffee black?</font>

247
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:43,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, green tea,
if you have it.</font>

248
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been trying to stay
away from coffee,</font>

249
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know,
a little bit healthier.</font>

250
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Mace... is she, uh,
back from Chicago yet?</font>

251
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm,
3 months ago.</font>

252
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">3 months.</font>

253
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... and what
was it, that...</font>

254
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Americorps.</font>

255
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Teaching.</font>

256
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Audrey,
how... how's she?</font>

257
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's fine, at the moment.</font>

258
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sometimes decides she
doesn't need her meds.</font>

259
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like her boyfriend.</font>

260
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:15,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">He watches out for her.</font>

261
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had an art show
in New Orleans,</font>

262
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">sold some paintings.</font>

263
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's good.
That's great.</font>

264
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should buy one,</font>

265
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if I can afford it.</font>

266
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the reason I, uh...</font>

267
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, like I said
on the phone, I...</font>

268
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to ask you
about those cops.</font>

269
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:41,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just wanted to know
about you and Rust.</font>

270
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly Rust.</font>

271
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:46,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanted to know about</font>

272
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fight in '02.</font>

273
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, did you tell them?</font>

274
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:54,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

275
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:58,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they think Rust
did something.</font>

276
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

277
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't.</font>

278
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think he did.</font>

279
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:13,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you...
talked to him?</font>

280
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not since.</font>

281
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you?</font>

282
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:22,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I mean, after
they brought me in.</font>

283
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

284
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is he?</font>

285
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Different, same.</font>

286
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he's lived rough</font>

287
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a long time now.</font>

288
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">He always did, it seemed like.</font>

289
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taken a toll.</font>

290
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs my help.</font>

291
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna help him?</font>

292
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

293
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:52,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

294
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:54,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to.</font>

295
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what is it?
What do the police
think he did?</font>

296
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't talk about that.
It's PI stuff.</font>

297
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:03,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's hiring the firm,
I'm hiring him.</font>

298
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this time, you two,</font>

299
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:10,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just...
Just like that?</font>

300
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I took some convincing.</font>

301
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:18,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I looked in Billy's eyes.</font>

302
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:20,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looked in mine.</font>

303
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got me suspended.</font>

304
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Billy Lee Tuttle</font>

305
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:28,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">owns 3 houses in Louisiana.</font>

306
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">One in Shreveport,
one in Baton Rouge,</font>

307
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">one in New Orleans.</font>

308
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also one in Florida.</font>

309
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:38,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I waited till he went
on his spring ministry
tour, 2010...</font>

310
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Rust, I changed my mind.</font>

311
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you did something,
I don't want to hear
about it.</font>

312
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember I told you
about my stint
in robbery?</font>

313
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make a pretty ace B&E man.</font>

314
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:54,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I staked
his places out for weeks.</font>

315
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checked surveillance,
map security.</font>

316
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found ingresses.
Now, here I am, you know.</font>

317
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:02,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">My whole life is just one
expanding, circular fuck-up</font>

318
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think it's about
to close out with me getting
clipped in a home invasion.</font>

319
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:13,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what I'm saying is
I was aware that I might
have lost my mind.</font>

320
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after the second home...</font>

321
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:32,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">doubt got taken behind
the woodshed and put down.</font>

322
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:38,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Notice he never reported
the Baton Rouge break-in,</font>

323
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">just the Shreveport house.</font>

324
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found those in the safe there.</font>

325
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paper stock's over 15 years old.</font>

326
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

327
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">These...
they aren't as bad</font>

328
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:53,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't know what
you're looking at.</font>

329
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfuck.</font>

330
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

331
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a videotape.</font>

332
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look.</font>

333
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

334
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">God!</font>

335
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

336
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

337
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

338
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

339
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:07,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You watch all of that?</font>

340
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:08,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

341
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:13,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I had to,
see if any of the men
took off their mask.</font>

342
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">None did.</font>

343
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck.</font>

344
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't avert my eyes.</font>

345
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:23,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not again.</font>

346
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:27,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

347
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little girl is
Marie Fontenot.</font>

348
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you kill Tuttle?</font>

349
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

350
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:40,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume that</font>

351
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was thinking he was
gonna be blackmailed.</font>

352
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think some
people took him out
after they found out</font>

353
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:51,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">what was taken
from the safe, before
he had a chance to.</font>

354
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:57,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... can I do to help?</font>

355
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:01,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">We start by pulling
everything there is
on Dora Lange.</font>

356
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got names,</font>

357
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:06,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got family members,
Tuttle connections.</font>

358
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any information that we can get</font>

359
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">on Reggie or Dewall Ledoux.</font>

360
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:14,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
we can coordinate
out of your offices</font>

361
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you want.</font>

362
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't have that.</font>

363
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:32,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody should have this.</font>

364
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:44,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad
that you're doing
good, Maggie.</font>

365
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like
everybody's happy,
you know.</font>

366
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:49,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... ahem.</font>

367
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to see.</font>

368
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:54,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you</font>

369
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">for everything.</font>

370
00:23:57,366 --> 00:24:02,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen you
in over two years,
Marty.</font>

371
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:07,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you come here
to say good-bye?</font>

372
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Maggie.</font>

373
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:14,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean that.</font>

374
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not gonna be
a bunch of people</font>

375
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:45,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming in and out of
this place, is there?</font>

376
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think, Rust?</font>

377
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:54,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Practical terms,
we're doing an identify
and locate.</font>

378
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I can't afford
to subscribe to all</font>

379
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">the databases that I used to,</font>

380
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I got Auto Track XP</font>

381
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">for motor vehicle records.</font>

382
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Flat Rate Info</font>

383
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the QI National
People Locator,</font>

384
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">public records, of course.</font>

385
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

386
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds good.</font>

387
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:23,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you been? Ahem.</font>

388
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, besides work,</font>

389
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:27,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do you do?</font>

390
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I just...
I don't ever remember
you asking me</font>

391
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">a personal question before.</font>

392
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... you know,</font>

393
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just stay busy, uh,</font>

394
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">fish, girlfriends.</font>

395
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seeing anybody?</font>

396
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.
Some dates.</font>

397
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:51,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's all
pretty casual.</font>

398
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:54,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did have something
going for a while,</font>

399
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:59,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">this Filipino girl,
but that didn't pan out.</font>

400
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:06,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet life.
I don't stay out late.
I just... I go home.</font>

401
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?</font>

402
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I'm about the same.</font>

403
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:26,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">No girlfriend.</font>

404
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go to work, go home.</font>

405
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about that girl
you were seeing in '02?</font>

406
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">What ever happened with her?</font>

407
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that was never gonna last.</font>

408
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never should have started.</font>

409
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Boy.</font>

410
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">She, uh, she had problems.</font>

411
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you always liked them crazy.</font>

412
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that I did.</font>

413
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you quit, Marty?</font>

414
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:16,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you could have
been boss, you know.</font>

415
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:19,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">LT, at least, captain.</font>

416
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:23,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did another 4 years
after you left, and I...</font>

417
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:27,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the job
just kind of ran
its course with me.</font>

418
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that?</font>

419
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna play
baseball, ride bulls.</font>

420
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you end up becoming</font>

421
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">something you never intended.</font>

422
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:43,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I guess you never
really even know why.</font>

423
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose I could
have been a painter,</font>

424
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, a historian.</font>

425
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old scenes, new details.</font>

426
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:55,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. You do
much painting?</font>

427
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:56,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.</font>

428
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little late in the game
to start something
like that, I reckon.</font>

429
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life's barely long enough
to get good at one thing.</font>

430
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that long.</font>

431
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:09,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so be careful
what you get good at.</font>

432
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you call
a black man who
flies a plane?</font>

433
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

434
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pilot, you racist bastard.</font>

435
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else would you call him?</font>

436
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:28,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, speaking of,
you know, I been taking
some writing courses?</font>

437
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh heh!
And, uh... no.</font>

438
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have, and I been
tinkering around</font>

439
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">with this thing off and on.</font>

440
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">True crime.</font>

441
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's the genre,
not the title.</font>

442
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:40,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">You serious?
Yeah.</font>

443
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:44,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, what happened
in '95 and some other
old cases,</font>

444
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all I need from you, Bobby,</font>

445
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:51,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">is some old copies
of case files.</font>

446
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:57,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still like your
single malt, don't you?</font>

447
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:02,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I guess I do.</font>

448
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, business gotten
so bad you got to
become a writer?</font>

449
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope, I've always
wanted to do it.
I just never had the time.</font>

450
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">And regards the files,
I'd like to avoid
Fuck and Suck,</font>

451
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:15,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">the two dicks I spent
last Saturday with.</font>

452
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Papania
and Gilbough.</font>

453
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear ya.</font>

454
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course, man.
Whatever you need.</font>

455
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

456
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Appreciate it, Bobby.</font>

457
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a problem.</font>

458
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missing persons, mostly.</font>

459
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe far back as the eighties.</font>

460
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, anything
before '05 that never</font>

461
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">became part of an
official investigation,</font>

462
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">it isn't gonna be
in the computers.</font>

463
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:43,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to
sort through the files.</font>

464
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:56,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

465
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found something, background.</font>

466
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:29,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dewall Ledoux
transferred title

<font color="#FFFFFF">to a Jimmy Ledoux.</font>

468
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Appears like that
might be a cousin.</font>

469
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:36,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found him in White Castle.</font>

470

<font color="#FFFFFF">Owns an auto shop.</font>

471
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

472
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you pull that
Marie Fontenot file?</font>

473
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">There wasn't one.</font>

474
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:49,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Report's gone.
Backtracking that.</font>

475
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:59,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, this
is Robert Doumain.
He owns the place.</font>

476
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how's it going?</font>

477
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice spot.</font>

478
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:07,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a cop no more, Robert.</font>

479
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:10,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got something against cops?</font>

480
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bob had a little boy.</font>

481
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been missing since '85.</font>

482
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,442

486
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any relation?</font>

487
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:37,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many Ledouxs around,
I never had to worry
about a connection.</font>

488
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, yeah, my dad's
second cousin
or something.</font>

489
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pops didn't like them none.</font>

490
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said they weren't
white enough
to be white trash.</font>

491
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this about, exactly?</font>

492
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man asked us
to locate his daughter.</font>

493
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:54,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a long time ago,
but it looks like she
might have known Dewall.</font>

494
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to hear that.</font>

495
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must know what happened to them.</font>

496
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sick shits.</font>

497
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop said they died too quick.</font>

498
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:05,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anything
you remember that you can
tell us about these guys?</font>

499
00:32:05,855 --> 00:32:08,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just they were nuts.
Looked at you funky.</font>

500
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:12,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie was always
asking about the
girls in my school,</font>

501
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:15,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">and couple times I
saw Dewall, he just
said kooky stuff.</font>

502
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:19,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance you ever saw
a third man with them,</font>

503
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man who had a bunch of scars</font>

504
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:25,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the bottom of his face?</font>

505
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's weird you say that.</font>

506
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember that face.</font>

507
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pop let them use
our deer camp once.</font>

508
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took me with him.
I was, like, 11.</font>

509
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:42,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were maybe
10 years older
than me.</font>

510
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">They introduced us to the guy.</font>

511
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:48,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">His face, underneath
his nose and cheeks,</font>

512
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">scarred.</font>

513
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gave me funny looks all night.</font>

514
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:55,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time
I glanced at him,
staring at me.</font>

515
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance this man
with the scars was
another Ledoux?</font>

516
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I don't know.
I don't think so.</font>

517
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next morning, men were
too hung-over to hunt.
Pop and I went home.</font>

518
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:13,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, uh, ever see him
again, guy with the scars?</font>

519
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never again.</font>

520
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:18,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd remember.</font>

521
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:34,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, I don't like this place.</font>

522
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:39,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing grows in
the right direction.</font>

523
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:43,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd this woman come from?</font>

524
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tax records.</font>

525
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drew a paycheck from
Tuttle's father.</font>

526
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:52,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, some kind of domestic.</font>

527
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you find her?</font>

528
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, had to get federal
income tax records</font>

529
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">from '40 to '59.</font>

530
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I matched Social

531
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the late nineties</font>

532
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:09,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Section-8 housing
in Alexandria.</font>

533
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, good job.</font>

534
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:13,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you. Heh!
Hmm.</font>

535
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:17,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">High praise from a bartender.</font>

536
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cops.</font>

537
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">She gets tired easy,</font>

538
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">'specially hot as it is.</font>

539
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:38,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't understand
what this is about.</font>

540
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

541
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:41,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're private investigators,</font>

542
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:45,012

ancestral research.</font>

543
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:48,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">M-mineral rights

544
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

545
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew
them Tuttle people,
but I heard stories.</font>

546
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

547
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:57,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think she might get
some money out this?</font>

548
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:59,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, quite possible.</font>

549
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:03,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Depends on what we find out.</font>

550
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Delores?</font>

551
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:10,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worked
for Mr. Sam Tuttle</font>

552
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">19 years, right?</font>

553
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:13,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

554
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erath.</font>

555
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

556
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then Shreveport.</font>

557
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you knew his son,
Billy Lee, right?</font>

558
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

559
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cousin, Eddie?</font>

560
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little boys, mm-hmm.
I remember.</font>

561
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about extended family?</font>

562
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cousins, you know,
that might have been
close to the boys?</font>

563
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those days,
families were bigger.</font>

564
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:41,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all sorts
of brothers, cousins,
kids just running around.</font>

565
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:43,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did, uh, Sam Tuttle have</font>

566
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">kids outside
his marriage that
you know about?</font>

567
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:48,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm!
Don't you know it.</font>

568
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:53,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, people kept
their own back then.</font>

569
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:58,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, a man's house
was his own.</font>

570
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Sam?</font>

571
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:03,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had lots of children.</font>

572
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">All types.</font>

573
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't like a woman...</font>

574
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:14,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, once she had it
done to her,</font>

575
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">he didn't like them
but that one time.</font>

576
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after that.</font>

577
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:23,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, and out
of all these kids
running around,</font>

578
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">you remember one
that maybe had scars</font>

579
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">all across the
bottom of his face?</font>

580
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:33,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I think that was
Mr. Sam's grandchild.</font>

581
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">His daddy did that
to him, that poor boy.</font>

582
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I think that child
was a... a Childress</font>

583
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:44,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">or what, Fi, he was
a LeBeau or a Childress?</font>

584
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:49,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">From Mr. Sam's
other family?</font>

585
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:53,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.</font>

586
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's OK.</font>

587
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:57,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Delores.</font>

588
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you have a look
at something for me?
One thing.</font>

589
00:37:01,117 --> 00:37:05,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just have a look.
See if you recognize it.</font>

590
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:16,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Carcosa?</font>

591
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

592
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:27,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him who eats time.</font>

593
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:32,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him robes...</font>

594
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:35,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a wind of invisible voices.</font>

595
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mineral rights, my ass.
What you all doing?</font>

596
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rejoice.</font>

597
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,224

598
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rejoice.
- You need to leave, now.</font>

599
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death is not the end.
You need to leave.</font>

600
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Carcosa?</font>

601
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You rejoice.</font>

602
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carcosa.</font>

603
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:26,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rest of the family,
they don't really
talk to Aunt D.</font>

604
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">She crazy.</font>

605
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:28,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementia.</font>

606
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">She never had any kind
of good life,</font>

607
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">but most days, she can't
even make sense.</font>

608
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? She sure
made sense to me.</font>

609
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:39,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should worry you, mister.</font>

610
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure hope that
old lady was wrong.</font>

611
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">About what?</font>

612
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">About death not being
the end of it.</font>

613
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:08,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did some backtracking
on the Marie Fontenot stuff.</font>

614
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got some old sheets.</font>

615
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheriff signed off on
the "report made in error,"</font>

616
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:16,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he didn't take the
original complaint on her.</font>

617
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputy did.</font>

618
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a name?</font>

619
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't gonna
believe this shit.</font>

620
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:25,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve Geraci.</font>

621
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I did some
double-checking.</font>

622
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:32,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before CID, he was
with Vermillion
Parish Sheriff's.</font>

623
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erath was his beat.</font>

624
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:37,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it got covered up,
Steve might know something.</font>

625
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:41,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't say
a fucking word when we
asked about it in '95.</font>

626
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I never did like
that cocksucker.</font>

627
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he now?</font>

628
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:50,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, this is the thing.</font>

629
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's from Iberia originally.</font>

630
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:55,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">After CID, he went home.</font>

631
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:59,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's Sheriff of Iberia Parish.</font>

632
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

633
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:01,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

634
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust, the only person
can arrest the sheriff</font>

635
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this state is the governor.</font>

636
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:09,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we ain't looking
to arrest him, Marty,</font>

637
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">just have a little chat.</font>

638
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he ain't
gonna talk with you.</font>

639
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:17,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a car battery
and two jumper cables
argue different.</font>

640
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even start with that shit.</font>

641
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you recommend, Marty?</font>

642
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, fuck, why don't
you talk to him?</font>

643
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two always liked each other.</font>

644
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what can I say?
I'm a people person.</font>

645
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, start with that, then.</font>

646
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

647
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:37,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

648
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just try to relax.
Take your time.</font>

649
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

650
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.
Nice shot.</font>

651
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that, 15 on the green?</font>

652
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha!
I don't know.</font>

653
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know, on the phone,</font>

654
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were saying
something about
that Fontenot girl.</font>

655
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:02,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Why's that
on your radar?</font>

656
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:06,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's nothing.
It's just, uh,</font>

657
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:09,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">extended family wants a locate.</font>

658
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:12,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't remember at the time.</font>

659
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back in '95,</font>

660
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hitting
the bottle a lot
back then.</font>

661
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, who wasn't?</font>

662
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:21,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">20 years ago, you know.</font>

663
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">My recall,</font>

664
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:26,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">girl's mom was single,</font>

665
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:29,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">drug charges.</font>

666
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

667
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:36,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little girl went to live
with her birth daddy,</font>

668
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think.</font>

669
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is, if I'm
remembering right.</font>

670
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Mama didn't make
a fuss after</font>

671
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:47,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first notice,
so she was fine with it.</font>

672
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:53,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you talked to
the family directly
back then?</font>

673
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:58,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Ted Childress,
the sheriff.
He knew them.</font>

674
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Childress?</font>

675
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now watch this.</font>

676
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whew!</font>

677
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like that?</font>

678
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seized it off
a good old boy, had a
quarter-bag of weed.</font>

679
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. You got to love
this country.</font>

680
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you again, man.</font>

681
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:21,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you.</font>

682
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:24,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh,</font>

683
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">that client you got,</font>

684
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:28,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">asking about the Fontenot girl.</font>

685
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:31,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let them know
I'll be happy
to talk to them.</font>

686
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:33,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, distant relatives.</font>

687
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">St. Louis.
Trying to settle
a tiny inheritance.</font>

688
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.</font>

689
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:40,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

690
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:44,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they want to talk,
you let them know.</font>

691
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Don't go
too fast, Sheriff.</font>

692
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me.</font>

693
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it again sometime.</font>

694
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'd like that.</font>

695
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

696
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:07,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better get those
jumper cables ready.</font>

697
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:10,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">The motherfucker's lying.</font>

698
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust.</font>

699
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to see you.</font>

700
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit.</font>

701
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to Marty.</font>

702
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:11,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you talked
to the cops, too.</font>

703
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:13,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, them, too.</font>

704
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

705
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd Marty tell you?</font>

706
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:19,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted to know what
the police asked me about.</font>

707
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:24,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was helping you
with something. That's it.</font>

708
00:44:25,494 --> 00:44:27,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long you been back?</font>

709
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:29,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear you got a big house.</font>

710
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty says the girls
are doing fine.</font>

711
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

712
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust,</font>

713
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:40,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">just tell me it's
something that's not
gonna get him hurt.</font>

714
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't tell you that.</font>

715
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">It never sat right with me,</font>

716
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:53,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it doesn't now,
you asking me to lie
to you about him.</font>

717
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, get on out of here.</font>

718
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:59,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're classing the place up.</font>

719
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:08,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you quit, Marty?</font>

720
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the real reason?
What happened?</font>

721
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me why you
come back, for real.</font>

722
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:17,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, you first.</font>

723
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you quit?</font>

724
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:24,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I saw something.</font>

725
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:27,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby.</font>

726
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:32,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweaker tried
to dry the kid</font>

727
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a microwave.</font>

728
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:47,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saw that, what he'd done,
and I thought...</font>

729
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">never again.</font>

730
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I... I never
want to look</font>

731
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:59,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">at anything like that anymore.</font>

732
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:02,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

733
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:06,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn.</font>

734
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:11,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you, uh,
why'd you come back?</font>

735
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">This.</font>

736
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something I had to see to...</font>

737
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">before getting on
with something else.</font>

738
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:33,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life's been a circle</font>

739
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">of violence and degradation</font>

740
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">long as I can remember.</font>

741
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:44,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready to tie it off.</font>

742
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:49,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you on the boat.</font>

743
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the other day,
I was thinking,</font>

744
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:06,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why don't I see Steve
and the boys more?"</font>

745
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't been out
to my camp in a while.</font>

746
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, if I
don't get out here</font>

747
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">3, 4 times a year...</font>

00:47:23,105 --> 00:47:24,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

751
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do love a reason to drink beer</font>

752
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">first thing in the morning.</font>

753
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

754
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, Steve, mmm,</font>

755
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I been wanting to ask,</font>

756
00:47:36,652 --> 00:47:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know that Fontenot girl?</font>

757
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, going off
with her daddy?</font>

758
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just wasn't clear.</font>

759
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it you knew for a fact</font>

760
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:49,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">that she went with her daddy,</font>

761
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">or somebody told you that
that's what happened?</font>

762
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">The family talked to
Sheriff Childress.</font>

763
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl's aunt and uncle,</font>

764
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:01,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">he knew them.</font>

765
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:03,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

766
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:06,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who were they?</font>

767
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:12,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting to think
this wasn't just</font>

768
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">a friendly invitation
from an old pal, huh?</font>

769
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's definitely that.</font>

770
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then try this, then.</font>

771
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said all I remember
about the girl.</font>

772
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:26,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just have
a good time, and
don't ask again.</font>

773
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:30,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm with you 150% on that.</font>

774
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

775
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thing is, Steve...</font>

776
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't gonna ask you.</font>

777
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:41,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is.</font>

778
00:48:46,054 --> 00:48:49,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I wouldn't
if I was you, Steve.</font>

779
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:53,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're out of
your jurisdiction, Sheriff.</font>

780
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:56,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize who I am
now, you assholes?</font>

781
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:59,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I wouldn't
be here if I didn't.</font>

782
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:01,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty.</font>

783
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:05,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me.
I ain't never been
able to control him.</font>

784
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

785
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're done after this.</font>

786
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:12,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have boss
crackers splitting
your ass in Angola.</font>

787
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:14,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we'll talk about that,</font>

788
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some other things.</font>

789
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

790
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">That church
Cohle talked about's
supposed to be right here.</font>

791
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're lost.
We're not lost.</font>

792
00:49:38,907 --> 00:49:42,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going in
the right direction.
We're heading south.</font>

793
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's gonna head us to 49?</font>

794
00:49:43,512 --> 00:49:44,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're not
looking for the 49.</font>

795
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for the church.</font>

796
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:48,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we're looking
for the church; we ain't
got to no church.</font>

797
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't seen nothing that
even resemble no church.</font>

798
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:52,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't nobody
out here to even ask
where anything is.</font>

799
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me know when
you see something.
There ain't nothing to see.</font>

800
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:03,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey!</font>

801
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir?</font>

802
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know there's
a little church
around here?</font>

803
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty old?
Black minister?</font>

804
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must mean Son of Life, sir.</font>

805
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">That place shut down.</font>

806
00:50:17,012 --> 00:50:21,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">'05, I think, just after
all them hurricanes.</font>

807
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

808
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:24,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live around here?</font>

809
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:27,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.
I live in St. Martin.</font>

810
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a parish contract.</font>

811
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take care of some cemeteries,</font>

812
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">public schools.</font>

813
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Thanks.</font>

814
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know
how to get to 49
from here?</font>

815
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:38,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

816
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a half-mile,
you'll see a left.</font>

817
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:43,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">PR 1435.</font>

818
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that.</font>

819
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">About... 7 miles
of fields.</font>

820
00:50:47,076 --> 00:50:49,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll hit 49 before Crowley.</font>

821
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know your way around, huh?</font>

822
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, boss.</font>

823
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:55,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the whole coast.
My family...</font>

824
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

825
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:20,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">My family's been here
a long, long time.</font>
