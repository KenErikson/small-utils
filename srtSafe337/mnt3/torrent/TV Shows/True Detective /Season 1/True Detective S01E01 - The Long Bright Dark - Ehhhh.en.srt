00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:21,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you think, you paired up with him?</font>

2
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd I think?</font>

3
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you don't pick your parents,</font>

4
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you don't pick your partner.</font>

5
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:35,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, they used to call
him The Tax Man for a while?</font>

6
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:40,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd come out of Texas, so nobody knew him.</font>

7
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seemed a bit...</font>

8
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">raw-boned to me, edgy.</font>

9
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took 3 months till we got him</font>

10
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">over to the house for dinner.</font>

11
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Around our big 419.</font>

12
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what y'all want to hear about, right,</font>

13
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora Lange, kids in the woods?</font>

14
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sure, but, uh, talk about Cohle.</font>

15
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">We heard some stories.</font>

16
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of a strange guy, huh?</font>

17
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange. Uh... heh heh heh.</font>

18
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

19
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust would pick a fight with the sky</font>

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he didn't like its shade of blue,</font>

21
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when we finally got him over to the house...</font>

22
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is when that case was hot...</font>

23
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">poor bastard looked like he was on his way</font>

24
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the firing squad.</font>

25
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora Lange.</font>

26
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Occult ritual murder.</font>

27
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can thank the "Advertiser" for that.</font>

28
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you, uh, hold off on that?</font>

29
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Yeah. You can't do that here no more.</font>

30
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Uh-uh.</font>

31
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be assholes.</font>

32
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to hear this or not?</font>

33
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vermillion sheriff requested assistance with a 419,</font>

35
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd been on the job about 3 months till then.</font>

36
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,728

00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farmer and his son.</font>

43
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's keep them here, and let's tape off this road,</font>

44
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:11,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">and give me your log.</font>

45
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take the log.</font>

46
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:16,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

47
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure you get everything down.</font>

48
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

49
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever see something like this?</font>

50
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:04,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir, in 8 years of CID.</font>

51

<font color="#FFFFFF">Them symbols, they's Satanic.</font>

52
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had a "20/20" on it a few years back.</font>

00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I.D.?</font>

54
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.</font>

55
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,610

<font color="#FFFFFF">CID is taking over. Get anybody who's free up here.</font>

65
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Tell me what you see.</font>

66
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ligature marks on her wrists, ankles, and knees.</font>

67
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Multiple shallow stab wounds to the abdomen.</font>

68
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hemorrhaging around throat,</font>

69
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:00,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">lividity at the shoulders, thighs, and torso.</font>

70
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:04,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd been on her back a while</font>

71
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he moved her.</font>

72
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why they called him The Tax Man.</font>

73
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of us had these little note pads or something.</font>

74
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had this big ledger.</font>

75
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:27,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looked funny walking door to
door with it like the tax man,</font>

76
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">which ain't bad as far as nicknames go.</font>

77
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Of course I've always taken a lot of notes.</font>

78
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you never know what
the thing's gonna be, do you?</font>

79
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little detail somewhere way down the line</font>

80
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:47,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes you say, "Ohh!" breaks the case.</font>

81
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've seen all the different types.</font>

82
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all fit a certain category...</font>

83
00:07:52,939 --> 00:08:00,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bully, the charmer, the, uh, surrogate dad,</font>

84
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:05,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">the man possessed by ungovernable rage,</font>

85
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:06,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">the brain...</font>

86
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:12,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and any of those types could be a good detective,</font>

87
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:17,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">and any of those types could
be an incompetent shitheel.</font>

88
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which type were you?</font>

89
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:25,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I was just a regular type dude</font>

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a big-ass dick.</font>

91
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of it had to do with how they manage authority.</font>

92
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">There can be a burden in authority, in vigilance,</font>

93
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a father's burden.</font>

94
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was too much for some men.</font>

95
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">A smart guy who's steady is hard to find.</font>

96
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was all right, better than some,</font>

97
00:08:54,234 --> 00:09:01,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I knew how to talk to people, and I was steady.</font>

98
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:06,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust... now his Texas files were classified</font>

99
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">or redacted, and he wasn't big on talking</font>

100
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">except when you wanted him to shut up,</font>

101
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he was smart.</font>

102
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Second week we were together,</font>

103
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw where he was living.</font>

104
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of made me feel for the guy.</font>

105
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd offer you a seat,</font>

106
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh...</font>

107
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mention it. I, uh... I can't stay.</font>

108
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll tell you guys...</font>

109
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">and believe me, past a certain age,</font>

110
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man without a family can be a bad thing.</font>

111
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:36,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd encountered a meta-psychotic,</font>

112
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I had to explain to Marty,</font>

113
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">what meta-psychotic was.</font>

114
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna happen again,</font>

115
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:55,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">or it's happened before, both.</font>

116
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

117
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:02,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fantasy enactment, ritual,</font>

118
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">fetishization, iconography.</font>

119
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is his vision.</font>

120
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her body is a paraphilic love map.</font>

121
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

122
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">An attachment of physical lust</font>

123
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:19,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fantasies and practices forbidden by society.</font>

124
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get that from one of your books?</font>

125
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

126
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her knees are abraded, rug burns on her back.</font>

127
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cold sores, gum line recession,</font>

128
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">bad teeth.</font>

129
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's decent odds she was a prost.</font>

130
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might not have known her, but...</font>

131
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:46,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">this idea goes way back with him.</font>

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... you got a chapter in one of those books</font>

133
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">on jumping to conclusions?</font>

134
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You attach an assumption to a piece of evidence,</font>

135
00:11:55,115 --> 00:12:00,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">you start to bend the narrative to support it,</font>

136
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">prejudice yourself.</font>

137
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:08,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait and see on the I.D.</font>

138
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

139
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">This kind of thing does not happen in a vacuum.</font>

140
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guarantee this wasn't his first.</font>

141
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too specific.</font>

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

143
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">listen, uh... ahem, this is</font>

144
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">a...</font>

145
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">stupid time to mention this,</font>

146
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">but...</font>

147
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've got to come to dinner.</font>

148
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't put Maggie off anymore,</font>

149
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you just got to.</font>

150
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

151
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon, thanks for coming.</font>

152
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty.</font>

153
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:15,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So...</font>

154
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, that evening, wasn't even sundown,</font>

155
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,</font>

156
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I got a problem with,</font>

157
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right, because I'm thinking about Marty's wife</font>

158
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:31,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this two kids and how it's my daughter's birthday,</font>

159
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know...</font>

160
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing I can do about it,</font>

161
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but...</font>

162
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have a drink.</font>

163
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get up! Heh heh!</font>

164
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:47,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy!</font>

165
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna meet him. I got to get the door.</font>

166
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

167
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Santa Claus is coming!</font>

168
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Jump! Ha ha ha!</font>

169
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">People out here,</font>

170
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:19,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like they don't even know
the outside world exists.</font>

171
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might as well be living n the fucking moon.</font>

172
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's all kinds of ghettos in the world.</font>

173
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all one ghetto, man,</font>

174
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">giant gutter in outer space.</font>

175
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, that scene,</font>

176
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:47,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is the most fucked up thing I ever caught.</font>

177
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask you something?</font>

178
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Christian, yeah?</font>

179
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

180
00:14:56,363 --> 00:15:01,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then what do you got the
cross for in your apartment?</font>

181
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:06,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a form of meditation.</font>

182
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

183
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I contemplate the moment in the garden,</font>

184
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:19,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">the idea of allowing your own crucifixion.</font>

185
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not a Christian.</font>

186
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:27,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you believe?</font>

187
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that people shouldn't talk</font>

188
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">about this type of shit at work.</font>

189
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, hold on.</font>

190
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... 3 months we been together,</font>

191
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get nothing from you.</font>

192
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, what we're into now,</font>

193
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">do me a courtesy, OK?</font>

194
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not trying to convert you.</font>

195
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. I consider myself a realist, all right,</font>

196
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in philosophical terms, I'm
what's called a pessimist.</font>

197
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, OK. What's that mean?</font>

198
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Means I'm bad at parties.</font>

199
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. Let me tell you.</font>

200
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:02,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't great outside of parties either.</font>

201
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think human consciousness</font>

202
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a tragic misstep in evolution.</font>

203
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">We became too self-aware.</font>

204
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nature created an aspect of
nature separate from itself.</font>

205
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:23,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are creatures that should not exist by natural law.</font>

206
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. That sounds god-fucking-awful, Rust.</font>

207
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:29,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are things that labor under the illusion</font>

208
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">of having a self,</font>

209
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">this accretion of sensory experience and feeling,</font>

210
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">programmed with total assurance
that we are each somebody</font>

211
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">when, in fact, everybody's nobody.</font>

212
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't go around spouting that shit, I was you.</font>

213
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">People around here don't think that way.</font>

214
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that way.</font>

215
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the honorable thing for species to do</font>

216
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">is deny our programming,</font>

217
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">stop reproducing,</font>

218
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">walk hand in hand into extinction,</font>

219
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">one last midnight, brothers and sisters</font>

220
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">opting out of a raw deal.</font>

221
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the point of getting out bed in the morning?</font>

222
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell myself I bear witness,</font>

223
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the real answer is that
it's obviously my programming,</font>

224
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I lack the constitution for suicide.</font>

225
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">My luck, I picked today to get to know you.</font>

226
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">3 months, I don't hear a word from you, and...</font>

227
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:29,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked. Yeah.</font>

228
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:34,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm begging you to shut the fuck up.</font>

229
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get a bad taste in my mouth out here.</font>

230
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aluminum, ash,</font>

231
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you can smell the psychosphere.</font>

232
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:52,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got an idea.</font>

233
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:57,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make the car a place of silent reflection</font>

234
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">from now on, OK?</font>

235
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:13,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">What should I bring for dinner?</font>

236
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:21,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bottle of wine would be nice, I guess.</font>

237
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't drink.</font>

238
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no, of course not, Rust.</font>

239
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. When you're at my house,</font>

240
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to chill the fuck out.</font>

241
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even mention any of that
bullshit you just said to me.</font>

242
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not, Marty.</font>

243
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not some kind of maniac, all right?</font>

244
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, for fuck's sake.</font>

245
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you hear?</font>

246
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask Cohle.</font>

247
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean The Tax Man?</font>

248
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, he's IA.</font>

249
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:07,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is State CID Homicide... Detective Geraci.</font>

250
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, ma'am.</font>

251
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm calling to ask about that night...</font>

252
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you never heard any shit like this before.</font>

253
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had...</font>

254
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">antlers. Um...</font>

255
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:20,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

256
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is... this is the real thing,</font>

257
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">some "Halloween" shit.</font>

258
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:34,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're gonna have to do a press conference.</font>

259
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about him? What do you think?</font>

260
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart...</font>

261
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">aloof.</font>

262
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't care about making friends,</font>

263
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's already running with it.</font>

264
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a real... real mind for it. Yeah.</font>

265
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'd keep him on then?</font>

266
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of us, yeah. I would.</font>

267
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You're still lead.</font>

268
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">The incident room is yours,</font>

269
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh, you do the briefing tomorrow.</font>

270
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. Thank you.</font>

271
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, sir.</font>

272
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:30,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck that prick.</font>

273
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I'm saying is it doesn't make any sense</font>

274
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">for her to be dumped in a cane field. Hello?</font>

275
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently she had all kinds of weird markings...</font>

276
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. No. I couldn't hear you there.</font>

277
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Antlers and shit.</font>

278
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my point. They wanted you to see her.</font>

279
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You don't mark up a body like that...</font>

280
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had antlers? What does that mean?</font>

281
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a crown.</font>

282
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll do the briefing tomorrow, guys, early.</font>

283
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">My guy does the AP Wire asked about Satanism.</font>

284
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">It got Speece here. You're gonna
have his nose up your ass.</font>

285
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major was saying something about a press conference.</font>

286
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess I can count my blessings, fellas.</font>

287
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for that.</font>

288
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. You mind if I skate? Ahem.</font>

289
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got some names from Vice, prost farms.</font>

290
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check around on our DB.</font>

291
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to go with you?</font>

292
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah. Just something to do.</font>

293
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You go ahead. I'll take care of the paperwork.</font>

294
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said, I'm feeling a lot of stuff</font>

295
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">hit me at this time...</font>

296
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:52,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">my daughter's birthday, this dead woman,</font>

297
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, um...</font>

298
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">figured I'd work the case, you know,</font>

299
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:02,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">till DiCillo called or we got an I.D.</font>

300
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">State Vice gave me some addresses to follow up on.</font>

301
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, nobody'd... nobody'd talked to me.</font>

302
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evening, ladies.</font>

303
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:52,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping to ask y'all a few questions.</font>

304
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, man.</font>

305
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the next round.</font>

306
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. You making trouble for us then?</font>

307

<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want them for?</font>

329
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't bust somebody for hooking</font>

346
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they last longer, too.</font>

347
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:47,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's not like that.</font>

348
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it like?</font>

363
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missed you the last couple days.</font>

364
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. I got to shower.</font>

368
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell him I'm debriefing the squad all morning.</font>

369
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,779

370
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,814

371
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, beautiful.</font>

372
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha! Morning, baby.</font>

373
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, how you want your coffee, doll?</font>

374
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strong and black just like you.</font>

00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much LSD?</font>

396
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard to say.</font>

397
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to wait for a mass spec.</font>

398
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:38,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she was drugged, bound,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

402
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about this stuff?</font>

403
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:55,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the crown, for lack of a better word,</font>

404
00:28:55,067 --> 00:29:00,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">rose thorns, early cane, switchgrass</font>

00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

412
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's all primitive. It's like cave paintings.</font>

413
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:24,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you ought to talk to an anthropologist.</font>

414
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lot of trouble this guy went to.</font>

415
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems real personal.</font>

416
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.</font>

417
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was iconic, planned...</font>

418
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in some ways, it was impersonal.</font>

419
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:55,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of the blindfold.</font>

420
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place is like somebody's memory</font>

421
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the town, and the memory's fading.</font>

422
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like there was never anything here but jungle.</font>

423
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:11,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop saying shit like that. It's unprofessional.</font>

424
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that what I'm going for here?</font>

425
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want you to stop saying odd shit,</font>

426
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you smell a psycho's fear</font>

427
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you're in someone's faded memory of a town.</font>

428
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:22,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stop.</font>

429
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, given how long it's taken for me</font>

430
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">to reconcile my nature, I can't figure</font>

431
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd forgo it on your account, Marty.</font>

432
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

433
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get any sleep last night?</font>

434
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't sleep.</font>

435
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just dream.</font>

436
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:55,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Occult.</font>

437
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know if this shit is anything but crazy,</font>

438
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Speece and the Superintendent,</font>

439
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're paying attention, the
newspapers are making hay,</font>

00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes they, uh, dove-hunt out there.</font>

463
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found a woman?</font>

464
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the Fontenot girl?</font>

465
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:51,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

466
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would you ask that? Don't know.</font>

467
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Went missing around here years back.</font>

468
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time something happened.</font>

469
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just thought maybe it's her.</font>

470
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old was she, this girl?</font>

471
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Little.</font>

472
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where the family lives?</font>

473
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had a place couple streets down.</font>

474
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:26,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">They moved out, though.</font>

475
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:30,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know the Fontenot girl, one went missing?</font>

476
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her?</font>

477
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her family come to our service</font>

478
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">once or twice, 5 or 6 years back.</font>

479
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the girl? Oh, Lord.</font>

480
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir, it's not.</font>

481
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

482
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to ask y'all something. Y'all think</font>

483
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe this have something to do with those cats?</font>

484
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What cats?</font>

485
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two of 'em... one, and a couple</font>

486
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">of weeks later, another.</font>

487
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody cut 'em up,</font>

488
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">turned their insides out, then nailed them</font>

489
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the front door, twice.</font>

490
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I called and told the police,</font>

491
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:05,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're predominantly African American congregation.</font>

492
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked for it to be investigated.</font>

493
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:12,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not those type of police, sir.</font>

494
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who is, then?</font>

495
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:22,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you something?</font>

496
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of these look familiar to you?</font>

497
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seen them anywheres? No.</font>

498
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they look like something that might be</font>

499
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">carved into a tree or something.</font>

500
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm. How about these?</font>

501
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that look like something my old auntie</font>

502
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:40,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">taught us how to make when I was a tyke.</font>

503
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they?</font>

504
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some folks call them bird traps.</font>

505
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old Auntie told us that they were devil nets.</font>

506
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:51,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put them around the bed, catch
the devil before he get too close.</font>

507
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's interesting.</font>

508
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. She was a wonderful woman.</font>

509
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loved her some Jesus, but had a bit</font>

510
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">of that Santeria in her, you know?</font>

511
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always just thought it was something</font>

512
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">for children to do, keep 'em busy,</font>

513
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell them stories why they're tying sticks together.</font>

514
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then that's all we got on the Fontenot girl.</font>

515
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was nothing in there.</font>

516
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says, "Possible report made in error."</font>

517
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that was 5 years ago.</font>

518
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ted Childress was sheriff back then.</font>

519
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's set up in Gulf Shores now, I think.</font>

520
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:25,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?</font>

521
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hold on now. My understanding,</font>

522
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">the little girl went off with her birth daddy.</font>

523
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, did you check her mom's record?</font>

524
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Possession, solicitation.</font>

525
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe Ted knew the family, and the feeling was</font>

526
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">the little girl was better off with her daddy.</font>

527
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom seemed to agree; she filed a complaint,</font>

528
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">then never bothered with it again,</font>

529
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">took off with her boyfriend.</font>

530
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">R&I said you had a complaint these parts</font>

531
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">around December... little girl</font>

532
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting chased through the woods.</font>

533
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:55,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, I pulled that one for you, too.</font>

534
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

535
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little girl said a green-eared spaghetti monster</font>

536
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">chased her through some woods.</font>

537
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we had her work with a sketch artist,</font>

538
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she told us that looked exactly right.</font>

539
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.</font>

540
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, boys.</font>

541
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to call a timeout, make a beer run.</font>

542
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:27,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't you hold off on that for a while?</font>

543
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, why don't you get it, then?</font>

544
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really don't want to do that.</font>

545
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, is this supposed to be admissible? Huh?</font>

546
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to pick my brain, work a room,</font>

547
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:45,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">you buy me a cheeseburger and a Coke, don't you?</font>

548
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take a sixer of Old Milwaukee</font>

549
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">or Lone Star, nothing snooty.</font>

550
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?</font>

551
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:55,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause it's Thursday and it's past noon.</font>

552
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thursday is one of my days off.</font>

553
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">On my off days, I start drinking at noon.</font>

554
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:06,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get to interrupt that.</font>

555
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

556
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd appreciate a little hustle up on that.</font>

557
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday,</font>

558
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">at approximately 6 A.M.,</font>

559
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">civilians came across the body of a female</font>

560
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a sugar cane field outside of Erath.</font>

561
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this person, we believe, was murdered,</font>

562
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we are not yet in a position to</font>

563
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">release the identity of the victim or to offer</font>

564
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">details of the crime.</font>

565
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our investigators</font>

566
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">have several leads, and hopefully we'll...</font>

567
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll have a suspect for you in custody soon.</font>

568
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:00,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this perpetrator</font>

569
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be apprehended, and he will know</font>

570
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">swift Louisiana justice.</font>

571
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie? Mm-hmm?</font>

572
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about your ex, Dora Lange.</font>

573
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to talk Dori?</font>

574
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's she said I've done now?</font>

575
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. We're just curious if you knew</font>

576
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">what she's been up to and maybe where she's living.</font>

577
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:21,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

578
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got her divorce papers pushed through</font>

579
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I been here about a year.</font>

580
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't blame the bitch.</font>

581
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got a habit?</font>

582
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a few.</font>

583
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weed, meth, juice.</font>

584
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Name it.</font>

585
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie,</font>

586
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:39,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">how'd y'all meet?</font>

587
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Growed up together, dropped out the same time.</font>

588
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hitched up way too quick.</font>

589
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:49,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how it is... you want a
wife, but only half the time.</font>

590
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

591
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you saying you hadn't heard from her?</font>

592
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">She called up here for you not too long ago.</font>

593
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:58,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">She couldn't help me anyway, man.</font>

594
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sounded all fucked up.</font>

595
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, that's exactly the kind of thing</font>

596
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we do want to know about, though, Charlie.</font>

597
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. All right.</font>

598
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... I needed some scratch for my store,</font>

599
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:11,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Dori owes me money, she ain't got no fuckin' phone,</font>

600
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">so got a number to her friend Carla, got her</font>

601
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">to call me back, and she ain't made no fuckin' sense.</font>

602
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:21,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. Carla's full name and phone number.</font>

603
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you mean, she didn't make sense?</font>

604
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like she could duck-hunt with a rake.</font>

605
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">High, yeah.</font>

606
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talkin' 'bout she's gonna become a nun.</font>

607
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why a nun? I don't know, man. She was high.</font>

608
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:38,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucked up, uh,</font>

609
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">talkin' 'bout... she met a king.</font>

610
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

611
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway...</font>

612
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need no snitch jacket up in here.</font>

613
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a break.</font>

614
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Avoyelles.</font>

615
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a goddamn day camp.</font>

616
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spend some time in Angola.</font>

617
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprised you even got Aryan Nation here.</font>

618
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd Dori do?</font>

619
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dori's dead.</font>

620
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, boys.</font>

621
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">We almost had a moment there.</font>

622
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:29,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

623
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:34,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you want to talk the whole
case through or just the end?</font>

624
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, whole story</font>

625
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">from your end, you don't mind.</font>

626
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, like he said, files got ruined.</font>

627
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurricane Rita.</font>

628
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">What he didn't say is that
this is about something else.</font>

629
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:53,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something new. That one in Lake Charles, maybe?</font>

630
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, why you say that?</font>

631
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the details out of the paper.</font>

632
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we did.</font>

633
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know anything about that, about Lake Charles?</font>

634
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let me see</font>

635
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you got, jog my memory.</font>

636
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's hear your story first,</font>

637
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">see how it fit with what we got.</font>

638
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:16,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, your dime, boss.</font>

639
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talking Cohle, what about that dinner</font>

640
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">you mentioned, he turn up drunk?</font>

641
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah.</font>

642
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, ahem.</font>

643
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dinner, that was a bit later.</font>

644
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was kind of funny.</font>

645
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flowers, you know?</font>

646
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, he read somewhere that
if you get invited to dinner,</font>

647
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're supposed to bring flowers?</font>

648
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hell?</font>

649
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can barely stand up.</font>

650
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

651
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't drink with me or the boys,</font>

652
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you got to get a load on</font>

653
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">before you visit my family?</font>

654
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Marty, it's not like that.</font>

655
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I didn't mean to,</font>

656
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right?</font>

657
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't drink 'cause I've had trouble</font>

658
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:06,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">with it before; I didn't mean to.</font>

659
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was checking on a CI.</font>

660
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:14,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ended up hanging around a bar.</font>

661
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sitting there.</font>

662
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:21,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't think of a good reason not to.</font>

663
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually I can.</font>

664
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.</font>

665
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have some more coffee</font>

666
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just try to make 10 minutes of conversation.</font>

667
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it.</font>

668
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call Chris or somebody,</font>

669
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">get you out of here.</font>

670
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty.</font>

671
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, man.</font>

672
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it.</font>

673
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:59,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll try this some other time.</font>

674
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:13,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, Rust, it is so nice to finally meet you.</font>

675
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry it took so long.</font>

676
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I tried to tell her you
aren't big on socializing.</font>

677
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said that your life's</font>

678
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:21,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this man's hands, right?</font>

679
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you should meet the family.</font>

680
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not quite as dramatic as that, hon.</font>

681
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never fired my gun.</font>

682
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you fired your gun?</font>

683
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audrey.</font>

684
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

685
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shot people?</font>

686
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Macie.</font>

687
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:44,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

688
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:47,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad's never shot anybody.</font>

689
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:50,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's good.</font>

690
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to shoot people.</font>

691
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you have.</font>

692
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:58,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty says you're from Texas.</font>

693
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:00,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, South Texas.</font>

694
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grew up in Alaska.</font>

695
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:06,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just been working here the last 10, 12 years.</font>

696
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of work?</font>

697
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Narcotics, mostly.</font>

698
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

699
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:16,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">was on the Robbery Squad in Houston until '89.</font>

700
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:21,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. Oh. Be right back.</font>

701
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all keep eating.</font>

702
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like your job?</font>

703
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly,</font>

704
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's worthwhile.</font>

705
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good at it.</font>

706
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not married?</font>

707
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once.</font>

708
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, not anymore. Mm-hmm.</font>

709
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:50,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you do this while you were married?</font>

710
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Chris.</font>

711
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, thanks for the page.</font>

712
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:58,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, he'll appreciate it.</font>

713
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... all right,</font>

714
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:04,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I appreciate it.</font>

715
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children?</font>

716
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

717
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">She passed.</font>

718
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:21,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marriage didn't last long after that.</font>

719
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

720
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. Chris Demma's on the phone for you.</font>

721
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something about a CI or...</font>

722
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back there to the left.</font>

723
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Of course.</font>

724
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:44,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

725
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

726
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were y'all talking about?</font>

727
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your job.</font>

728
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:58,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know about him, Marty?</font>

729
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, not a lot.</font>

730
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could be a good detective.</font>

731
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's running on this thing, but, uh...</font>

732
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">uppity.</font>

733
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

734
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:18,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez. Have you ever asked him about himself?</font>

735
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, trust me.</font>

736
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not want to pick this man's brain.</font>

737
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

738
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:34,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, some details on the CI. Ahem.</font>

739
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for dinner, Maggie.</font>

740
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">This looks great. My pleasure.</font>

741
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like that broccoli.</font>

742
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind your manners.</font>

743
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you, uh, need to go or what?</font>

744
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's nothing can't wait till tomorrow.</font>

745
00:46:54,577 --> 00:47:00,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust, uh, what you were saying before?</font>

746
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we can find something nicer to talk about.</font>

747
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, I saw your table in there.</font>

748
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fly-fish?</font>

749
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little bit.</font>

750
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:18,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?</font>

751
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heard about that.</font>

752
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well... what happened between me and him</font>

753
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:28,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't have nothing to do with Dora Lange.</font>

754
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:32,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worked with Rust Cohle for 7 years.</font>

755
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">People change.</font>

756
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relationships change.</font>

757
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay in touch?</font>

758
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

759
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I haven't talked to Rust in...</font>

760
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">10 years.</font>

761
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:52,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

762
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:56,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, however we...</font>

763
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was a good detective,</font>

764
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:02,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it don't matter how he ended it. I mean...</font>

765
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say that because it's the truth,</font>

766
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't hold grudges.</font>

767
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that's the shit</font>

768
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">that leads to cancer.</font>

769
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why am I talking about dinner?</font>

770
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:27,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all want to walk through the Lange case, fine.</font>

771
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">This other stuff... well, what's going on?</font>

772
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. We just heard some stories.</font>

773
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, personally, I heard he was</font>

774
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">an ace case man, right?</font>

775
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to understand his process.</font>

776
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:47,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">"His process."</font>

777
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

778
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other landlord says she trashed the place,</font>

779
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">so she lost her deposit.</font>

780
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:56,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the neighbors check out.</font>

781
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those that remember her said that she, uh,</font>

782
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">used to come in early in the morning,</font>

783
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:05,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she came home at all.</font>

784
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys canvass the bars pretty good today?</font>

785
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, up your ass, Cohle.</font>

786
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you do your own fuckin' leg work,</font>

787
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">you rat fuck?</font>

788
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it again, rummy.</font>

789
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

790
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, man?</font>

791
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you,</font>

792
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tax Man.</font>

793
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

794
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. Back to point.</font>

795
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got 3 hits on working girls.</font>

796
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one close to her, naturally.</font>

797
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few names recognized her as occasional.</font>

798
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like she tricked now and then, show up</font>

799
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a couple of truck stops when she needed cash.</font>

800
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got some names. Which ones?</font>

801
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:03,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard from my AP guy, Ray Fontenot.</font>

802
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said her uncle's Danny Fontenot...</font>

803
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">the pitcher, LSU.</font>

804
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I watched him play. Great player.</font>

805
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:13,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he lives close by. Ahem.</font>

806
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thanks, guys.</font>

807
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you two? Did you get anything today?</font>

808
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much, sir. Well...</font>

809
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might know the Reverend Tuttle.</font>

810
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">He runs our state-wide charity drive.</font>

811
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Detective Hart, Detective Cohle.</font>

812
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleasure to meet you, officers.</font>

813
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you. Cohle.</font>

814
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your case has a lot of people taking care,</font>

815
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:36,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">doors locking where they used to not.</font>

816
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie's been speaking to me about it.</font>

817
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:39,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concerned, very concerned.</font>

818
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been discussing the viability of a task force</font>

819
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">to investigate crimes with an
anti-Christian connotation.</font>

820
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">You what? Really?</font>

821
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:53,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

822
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:58,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mean to tell men of your positions,</font>

823
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:03,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there is a war happening behind things.</font>

824
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:06,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for doing your part.</font>

825
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:09,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, sir. Yeah.</font>

826
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:11,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

827
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie's going to be very, very pleased</font>

828
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:18,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have such good men working on this.</font>

829
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?</font>

830
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Un-fuckin'-believable.</font>

831
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Anti-Christian."</font>

832
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucks. And who the fuck's Eddie?</font>

833
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:33,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

834
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:35,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he serious?</font>

835
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he doesn't have a television.</font>

836
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Eddie? And he's from Texas.</font>

837
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the fuckin' governor...</font>

838
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edwin Tuttle. Ah.</font>

839
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're first cousins.</font>

840
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that makes sense.</font>

841
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's the sound of The Big Machine,</font>

842
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cohle, that's gearing up to pound your ass.</font>

843
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh!</font>

844
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sound of a gaggle of hens.</font>

845
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you better watch your mouth</font>

846
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:59,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">or they're gonna peck your eyes out.</font>

847
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Hi.</font>

848
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am looking for Detective Hart.</font>

849
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a stack of depositions for him.</font>

850
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judge Sutpen told me to make sure and give them</font>

851
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Detective Hart and no one else, so...</font>

852
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Is that the, um...</font>

853
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:12,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">The, uh, depositions.</font>

854
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:14,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I should walk you through them.</font>

855
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Great, great. Let's just find a place to talk.</font>

856
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:19,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Cathleen.</font>

857
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

858
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right through here.</font>

859
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your victim was Dora Lange,</font>

860
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you all checked on Marie Fontenot.</font>

861
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:56,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

862
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missing girl, 5 years gone,</font>

863
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:00,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">report made in error?</font>

864
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:04,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had an uncle who lived nearby...</font>

865
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">and call it intuition.</font>

866
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes he's more responsive.</font>

867
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:14,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to help.</font>

868
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:22,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Fontenot.</font>

869
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, ahem.</font>

870
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">We met,</font>

871
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, maybe 7 years ago.</font>

872
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was visiting Skip Hays.</font>

873
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:37,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd played for USL.</font>

874
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thing of beauty, sir, watching you throw.</font>

875
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

876
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Danny, this man's a detective</font>

877
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the police.</font>

878
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:53,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

879
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:57,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm actually... Ahem. Sorry, uh,</font>

880
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:01,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wanted to ask you about your niece, Marie.</font>

881
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:01,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

882
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:05,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">"How much could You put on one family?" I ask the Lord.</font>

883
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">We try to get by.</font>

884
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know Marie's birth father?</font>

885
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Len?</font>

886
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Len Stroghes was her daddy.</font>

887
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:15,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

888
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:17,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's OK.</font>

889
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're asking because, uh,</font>

890
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:22,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">we had heard that Marie ran off with him</font>

891
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that... she wasn't really missing.</font>

892
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Debbie said.</font>

893
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, uh... anybody heard from Len?</font>

894
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:39,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody maybe knows where he's at?</font>

895
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, sorry. The last thing.</font>

896
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where Debbie is now?</font>

897
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">She married another man.</font>

898
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the one she's with when Marie...</font>

899
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:56,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was in Vegas, last we heard.</font>

900
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marie must have loved it here.</font>

901
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:21,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

902
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this for her?</font>

903
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:25,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Danny loved her so much.</font>

904
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't her legal guardians,</font>

905
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she played here all the time,</font>

906
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than her Mama's.</font>

907
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see why.</font>

908
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:38,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it Dan has, if you don't mind my asking?</font>

909
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:42,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">All they ever told us was "a cerebral event."</font>

910
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Series of strokes, like.</font>

911
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty?</font>

912
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me for one sec.</font>

913
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside on the floor on the right.</font>

914
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:33,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that is.</font>

915
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:37,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't looked in there since the police first came.</font>

916
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:48,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet you want to hear the hero shot, huh?</font>

917
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:52,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">That place we carried the kids out?</font>

918
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, sure.</font>

919
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what did she look like...</font>

920
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">that one in Lake Charles?</font>

921
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you, uh, tell us</font>

922
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything about that, Mr. Cohle?</font>

923
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks a lot like the one from '95,</font>

924
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:40,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">but... well, you knew that already.</font>

925
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:45,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there are specifics consistent to the '95 case,</font>

926
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">details that weren't public knowledge.</font>

927
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were off the grid for 8 years, right?</font>

928

<font color="#FFFFFF">Show back up here 2010. My question is...</font>

929
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:58,907

00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:24,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then start asking the right fuckin' questions.</font>
