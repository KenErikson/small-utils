00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucked with us, Charlie.</font>

3
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not, sir.</font>

4
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie Ledoux.</font>

5
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I don't even want
to know that freak, man.</font>

6
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:55,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all ain't asked
nothin' about Reggie.</font>

7
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, man, my...
My wife just died...</font>

8
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ex-wife!</font>

9
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had Reggie Ledoux
take her out,</font>

10
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't you?</font>

11
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:05,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Hmm?</font>

12
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
talking about, man?
Hmm?</font>

13
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:10,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie? Put her out there
with them antlers on? I...</font>

14
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have Reggie do it?</font>

15
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
talking about?
Hmm?</font>

16
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie Ledoux did this?</font>

17
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie Ledoux?</font>

18
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie motherfuckin'
Ledoux did this?</font>

19
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, man! Shit!
Let me out, man!</font>

20
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me out!
Fuck, man!</font>

21
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Charlie?</font>

22
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna give you
the Oscar no matter
how hard you try.</font>

23
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck you, man.
You don't know me.</font>

24
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
what I been through.</font>

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what are you talking
about? You talk to me!</font>

26
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:40,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ledoux knew about her, right?</font>

27
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk about her to him?</font>

28
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man... yeah,
the way you do
sharing a house.</font>

29
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you talk pussy,
talk scores.</font>

30
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you do.</font>

31
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Showed him pictures of her, hmm?</font>

32
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess so, yeah.</font>

33
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had some she give me
when I first went down,</font>

34
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">stuff for me to look at.</font>

35
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, like Polaroids.</font>

36
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a big guy...</font>

37
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:03,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot bigger than you.</font>

38
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you tell me you
didn't get along?</font>

39
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, I mean, I did, most part.</font>

40
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to,
you're sharing a house,</font>

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I'm saying.</font>

42
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he gets you high,
man, but he's creep.
I ain't want to know him.</font>

43
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about Ledoux.</font>

44
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is he creep?</font>

45
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a cook, you know,
like a chemist?</font>

46
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used to, uh, make shit
out of kitchen stuff...</font>

47
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:25,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cook down cleansers and whatnot.</font>

48
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Used tater skins
and fry grease to make
high-test sour mash.</font>

49
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got mad knowledge
for that shit, but,
like, I don't know, man,</font>

50
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">he talk like a short-eyes,
like something.</font>

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you mean?
He wouldn't talk
that shit up in here.</font>

52
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, man, he didn't.
Like, me and him
at night,</font>

53
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">blasted up on one of his mixes.</font>

54
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he could
brew some shit up</font>

55
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">put you up out your head, man.</font>

56
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a big deal in here.</font>

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, fuck, man,
it's a big deal
out there, too.</font>

58
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:53,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, what kind
of shit was he talking?</font>

59
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said that there's
this place down south</font>

60
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">where all these rich men
go to, uh, devil-worship.</font>

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said that, uh...</font>

62
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">they... they sacrifice
kids and whatnot.</font>

63
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women and children all got...</font>

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">All got murdered there, and, um,</font>

65
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">something about someplace
called Carcosa</font>

66
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Yellow King.</font>

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said there's all
these, like, old stones
out in the woods,</font>

68
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:21,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">people go to, like, worship.</font>

69
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, uh...</font>

70
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:26,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said there's just
so much good killin'
down there.</font>

71
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie got this
brand on his back,</font>

72
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">like in a spiral?</font>

73
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says that's their sign.</font>

74
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck ever,
you understand?</font>

75
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't listen
to the man, but he's big,</font>

76
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I don't tell him
to shut the fuck up,
neither!</font>

77
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:42,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember
any buddies he ever
talked about?</font>

78
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:43,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we checked the records here,</font>

79
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he hadn't ever
had any visitors.</font>

80
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know Tyro Weems.</font>

81
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:52,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrone like to tell you
where he's at.</font>

82
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:56,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, man, Reggie's
crazy, like, for real.</font>

83
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had to be tough,</font>

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">living with
somebody spouting
insane shit</font>

85
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your ear all day long.</font>

86
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna give me
something for what
I told you just now?</font>

87
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parole board nod.</font>

88
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair's fair.</font>

89
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:31,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey!</font>

90
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:36,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think 'cause I talked
to him about Dori that...</font>

91
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might have got her killed?</font>

92
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:44,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably had
something to do with it.</font>

93
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you
should have shown him
those pictures.</font>

94
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

95
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find
this Tyrone Weems,</font>

96
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">see what he knows about Ledoux.</font>

97
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

98
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

99
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't have to
tell him it was
his fault.</font>

100
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy was already low.</font>

101
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he asked
about his end first.</font>

102
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parole board.</font>

103
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

104
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">So fuck him.</font>

105
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're funny, Marty...</font>

106
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shit you get soft about.</font>

107
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">VOICE-I wanted
every member of that family
that I could find.</font>

108
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out...</font>

109
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">there weren't any.</font>

110
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how weird
that is in Louisiana?</font>

111
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cousin, what was it,
Dewall, was</font>

112
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:07,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">not on paper except
for a, uh, trucker's license.</font>

113
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ledoux had turned into a ghost</font>

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the time he skipped
parole check.</font>

115
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, young studs,</font>

116
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:21,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would you do
when you hit a wall like that?</font>

117
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:26,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Responding to the complaint,
I approached the house.</font>

118
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:33,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing that the screen door
was broken and the inner door...</font>

119
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:36,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">ajar, I... I felt that entrance</font>

120
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">complied with standard
procedure.</font>

121
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Upon entering
the domicile, I noticed</font>

122
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">what appeared to be marijuana
and a white powder</font>

123
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the coffee table.</font>

124
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Martin.</font>

125
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have to talk, Lisa.</font>

126
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:00,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hell we don't.</font>

127
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get to do
what you did to me
last week.</font>

128
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry.
I was hurt
and real drunk.</font>

129
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to me now.</font>

130
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Ah, I wish you
a great life</font>

131
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and good luck with
your new friend.</font>

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,728

fucking asshole.</font>

133
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,228

135
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">your disappointment
is irrelevant.</font>

136
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get to act
like that, Marty,</font>

137
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">or like this.</font>

138
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fact is it's nice
to know you got him,</font>

139
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't want to
have this conversation
with you.</font>

140
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to respect me, Marty.</font>

141
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is respect.</font>

142
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:43,019

real good for it.</font>

154
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">No line on any of his people.</font>

155
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,586

158
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

159
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:28,131

165
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about his friends?</font>

166
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where they hang out?</font>

167
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,912

I don't want to.</font>

172
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard he got
Shawnda Miller pregnant.</font>

173

00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes, I do.
You don't mean that.</font>

298
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I...</font>

299
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not gonna
break up my fuckin'
family, OK?</font>

300
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here right now!
No.</font>

301
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
You all right, Maggie?</font>

302
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I suggest you leave.</font>

303
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's fine, Doc.
I'm State Police.</font>

304
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate that,
but are you here
in that capacity now,</font>

305
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:40,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">as... as law enforcement?</font>

306
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to do this.</font>

307
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your hands
off me, goddamn it,</font>

308
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">and call your
commanding officer.</font>

309
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making
a scene, Marty!
No!</font>

310
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no scene,
unless Mall Patrol
here makes one.</font>

311
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am calmly discussing
a private matter</font>

312
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my wife!</font>

313
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Private in a pretty
public way, man.
Easy, easy.</font>

314
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is none of your
fuckin' business.
No, no.</font>

315
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's none of my business,
but we got to work.</font>

316
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear me, Marty?</font>

317
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a line on Ledoux.</font>

318
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:58,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it right fuckin' now.</font>

319
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:01,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to come in,
leave this shit till later.</font>

320
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, honey,</font>

321
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I ain't givin' up.</font>

322
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

323
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get to Ledoux.
Marty, it's gonna be dirty.</font>

324
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need her
to give me another shot.</font>

325
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could just get
another shot...</font>

326
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, can I
tell you something?</font>

327
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

328
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is none of my business.</font>

329
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear it.</font>

330
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'm sorry.</font>

331
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:40,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You total shit.</font>

332
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:43,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, this is part
on you, you know?</font>

333
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just slide
into my life,</font>

334
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">creating tensions, judging me...</font>

335
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, I make you tap
some bimbo, looks like
a young Maggie?</font>

336
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make you flaunt that shit?</font>

337
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:54,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, that night
at the Longhorn,</font>

338
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were so obvious,
man, checking her out,</font>

339
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she looked
crazy enough to have
followed you there.</font>

340
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all the dick
swagger you roll, you
can't spot crazy pussy?</font>

341
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fucked up.</font>

342
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just...</font>

343
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like something wild.
I always did.</font>

344
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just...
it feels like it...</font>

345
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">It smoothes out
the other parts
of my life most of...</font>

346
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:23,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Marty,
one more time. It's none
of my fuckin' business.</font>

347
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, fuck.</font>

348
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we got a job to do.</font>

349
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:30,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off-book.
That's the only play
I can think of.</font>

350
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:34,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I got to straighten out
things with the family.
I got to fix it.</font>

351
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">That bike club.
I know 'em.</font>

352
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had deals
with 'em when I was
working narco.</font>

353
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get to that
motherfucker Ledoux.</font>

354
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, enough with this
self-improvement,</font>

355
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">penance,
hand-wringing shit.</font>

356
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go to work.</font>

357
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you're...</font>

358
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:56,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

359
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell of a bedside manner
you got, Rust.</font>

360
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, you know being
stupid's different
than callin' in sick,</font>

361
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is a bar,
not a fuckin' bedside.</font>

362
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friend in need.</font>

363
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I think
you hit a ceiling,</font>

364
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">you just keep raising the bar.</font>

365
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:15,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are like
the Michael Jordan of
being a son of a bitch.</font>

366
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Come on.
Really gonna love
this jacket I got.</font>

367
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.</font>

368
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:27,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You visit a lot of gun shows?</font>

369
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:33,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, it's just some stuff
I kept in case some work
came back on me.</font>

370
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:38,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">These boys Ledoux deals to,</font>

371
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're out of east Texas.</font>

372
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:44,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worked 'em when I
was DEA task force.</font>

373
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:49,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know you're 5-0?</font>

374
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

375
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:50,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure,</font>

376
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I checked with
my old handler.</font>

377
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as my cover goes,</font>

378
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:58,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took 3 slugs in a DEA shootout</font>

379
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Port Houston.</font>

380
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:05,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody
that gives a shit
figures I'm dead.</font>

381
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major said</font>

382
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:11,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">the task force used
to call you Crash.</font>

383
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to take
some personal time</font>

384
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">on this, Marty,
a couple of weeks.</font>

385
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to get out there
and get seen, drop
some lines.</font>

386
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, badges ain't
gonna get us near
these people,</font>

387
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the plan is
we make 'em an offer...</font>

388
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:29,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">we get a line on their supplier,</font>

389
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">confirm it's Ledoux,</font>

390
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">bring him in.</font>

391
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, once we're out there,</font>

392
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right, it's just
you and me on this.</font>

393
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like that.</font>

394
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens, they clock
you're not you?</font>

395
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

396
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't do
what I need to do
if we got watchdogs.</font>

397
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, like you said,
Quesada'd pull me.</font>

398
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:56,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stakes ain't
that high anyway.</font>

399
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get found, I take
a bullet to the head.</font>

400
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cartel I worked
on the border,</font>

401
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">they, uh, they had this routine.</font>

402
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:11,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd duct-tape you
to a chair that was
bolted to the floor,</font>

403
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">use a couple rolls,</font>

404
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">make sure you couldn't
budge a fuckin' inch.</font>

405
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'd cut around your face,</font>

406
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">grip your scalp, yank down,</font>

407
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">rip your face off.</font>

408
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

409
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'd put a mirror
in front of you</font>

410
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you could get
a good look at yourself.</font>

411
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:40,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'd cut your dick
and your balls off...</font>

412
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">shove 'em down your throat</font>

413
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you bled and choked out,</font>

414
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:49,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you were watching.</font>

415
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

416
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">as far as high stakes go,</font>

417
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">bullet to the head?</font>

418
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't that.</font>

419
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

420
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you want to do this?</font>

421
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.</font>

422
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:35,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Realize you got
a upstairs here, right?</font>

423
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

424
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:49,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ink and cayenne.</font>

425
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Irritates the skin,
looks contused.</font>

426
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:57,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long they have you
out there, working
the corridor?</font>

427
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost 4 years.</font>

428
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">4? What the hell?</font>

429
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:06,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">UCs ain't supposed
to do more than
11 months.</font>

430
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:10,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I... I'd
fucked up on the job,</font>

431
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to make it better,
they went with me.</font>

432
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a long time,
being like that.</font>

433
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:29,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a good story
to move fast, and I
think I got one.</font>

434
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we need now is
some good coke.</font>

435
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you gonna get that?</font>

436
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.</font>

437
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you got a suspect,</font>

438
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:47,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you take a leave of absence?</font>

439
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

440
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said, to see my pops.</font>

441
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had leukemia.</font>

442
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:03,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Favre. Ahem. I get
the evidence key
from you?</font>

443
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Heard you
were taking time.</font>

444
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Leaving tonight.</font>

445
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sign the log.
Yep.</font>

446
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:30,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You supposed to see
both eyes in this one?</font>

447
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">They really should have
a better system for this.</font>

448
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">We looked
at your old partner's
history.</font>

449
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:08,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And coincidences keep
mounting, Detective.</font>

450
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, coincidences like what?</font>

451
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:14,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know
if it would qualify
as coincidence, but,</font>

452
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">near as we could tell,
his pops never had
leukemia.</font>

453
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">No hospital records of that.
Fact, nobody in
that town in Alaska's</font>

454
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">seen Travis Cohle
in more than 30 years.</font>

455
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:25,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it?</font>

456
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:29,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still angry
at him, your pops?</font>

457
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

458
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:32,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

459
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were, though.</font>

460
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, why you two didn't talk.</font>

461
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never really liked
each other.</font>

462
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a difference.</font>

463
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:47,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was in 'Nam.</font>

464
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Met my mother on leave
in Galveston.</font>

465
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time he came back, I was two.</font>

466
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">She dumped me on him,</font>

467
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">then she hauled ass,
and he and I moved to Alaska.</font>

468
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:02,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a survivalist,
I guess you'd call it.</font>

469
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had some very fucking
strange ideas.</font>

470
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's nothing like
the night sky out there, though.</font>

471
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I couldn't handle
the cold, so...</font>

472
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:21,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I headed back to south Texas
'cause all I could remember</font>

473
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:25,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">was at least it never got cold.</font>

474
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">My old man always made
like I let him down
that way.</font>

475
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said I had no loyalty.</font>

476
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">A clean break
is best now, while
they're still young.</font>

477
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:43,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, that's none
of my business.</font>

478
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, but I do need him
to watch my back on this.</font>

479
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how you all get warped.</font>

480
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always short-change
the wrong things.</font>

481
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:53,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Short-change?</font>

482
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

483
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:56,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else?</font>

484
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted me to pass
a tide of apologies</font>

485
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:03,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">of which I'll skip...</font>

486
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he wants to see the girls,</font>

487
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can make time for it.</font>

488
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:17,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kids are the only thing
that matter, Maggie.</font>

489
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the only reason
for this whole
man-woman drama.</font>

490
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

491
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
suggesting, exactly?</font>

492
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just that people fuck up.</font>

493
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">We age.</font>

494
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men, women... it's not
supposed to work</font>

495
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:37,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">except to make kids.</font>

496
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if you can imagine</font>

497
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty's behavior
as an expression</font>

498
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">of weakness, pain,</font>

499
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd see that it's
not about you.</font>

500
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, end of the day,
you duck under
rationalization,</font>

501
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">same as any of them.</font>

502
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:56,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have been
a great husband.</font>

503
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have been
seeing me around
for about a week.</font>

504
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy I used to run
with, he wants
to meet me tonight.</font>

505
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if I can get him
alone, we snatch him up,</font>

506
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:43,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">work him over,
maybe get to Ledoux.</font>

507
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

508
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?
Great.</font>

509
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen...</font>

510
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:50,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phone's fully charged.
And remember,
it's real simple.</font>

511
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green... answers,
red... hangs up.</font>

512
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:55,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
I'm the only one that's
gonna be calling.</font>

513
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
And keep it charged.</font>

514
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, uh, how was she?</font>

515
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd she say?</font>

516
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was better.
I could see her
softening.</font>

517
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't use the "D" word.</font>

518
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:16,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">My odds, I could see
you two back together
within a couple months.</font>

519
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">That your honest read?</font>

520
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my honest read, Marty.</font>

521
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't know</font>

522
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">how this guy I'm
meeting tonight
feels about me.</font>

523
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK?
What does that mean?</font>

524
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:55,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means, if you lose
track of me tonight,
keep this fucker handy</font>

525
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">and be listening
to Beaumont police
channels.</font>

526
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
You got it?</font>

527
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:01,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

528
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it?</font>

529
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it.
Are you gonna be
all right?</font>

530
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

531
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crash, here for Ginger.</font>

532
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, after Houston,</font>

533
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to a doc in Eagle Pass,</font>

534
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">then a coyote got me
across the border.</font>

535
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Past two years, I been
working security</font>

536
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a group in San Miguel.</font>

537
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feds never ID'd me,
you know, so I figured,</font>

538
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">hell, two years pass,
things chill down,</font>

539
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's cool for me
to come back,
stick my head up.</font>

540
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:42,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll be tough, man...</font>

541
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinkin' you been dead
this whole time.</font>

542
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look dead, motherfucker?</font>

543
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lookin' to get with you.</font>

544
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:53,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You or Miles.</font>

545
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miles ain't gonna want
to see you, Crash.</font>

546
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think
he might.
Well, yeah.</font>

547
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'd say</font>

548
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
you want to see Miles.</font>

549
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I ain't here
to start a thing,
all right?</font>

550
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys I been running
with in Mexico,</font>

551
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">there could be
a hell of a deal
for both sides,</font>

552
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:13,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">fuckin' money to be made.</font>

553
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real money.</font>

554
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of money?</font>

555
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn Rust.</font>

556
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:29,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

557
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boys are looking
to trade, all right?</font>

558
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coke for meth.</font>

559
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you got there?
Ahem.</font>

560
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's just for you.
Just for me?</font>

561
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

562
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you cut it with?</font>

563
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:18,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you'll see.</font>

564
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll dig it.</font>

565
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all I meant to you, huh?</font>

566
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:39,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who exactly are these guys?</font>

567
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, they, uh...</font>

568
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">ex-Mex Army.</font>

569
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got a Colombian connection.</font>

570
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need meth for
the maquiladoras.</font>

571
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they could
cook it themselves,</font>

572
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then the cartels
would take notice,</font>

573
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:00,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that ain't what
they're lookin' for.</font>

574
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:02,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

575
00:40:06,168 --> 00:40:07,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

576
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taste that, homie.</font>

577
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">That ain't no
fuck-around shit.</font>

578
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn.</font>

579
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whew.</font>

580
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep it.</font>

581
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:36,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got bulldozers'
worth of that shit
where I came from.</font>

582
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:41,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing is...</font>

583
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">we got one cook.</font>

584
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:46,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does all our work,
exclusive-like.</font>

585
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's real specific about that.</font>

586
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what's this
worth to you, Crash, me
selling Miles on this?</font>

587
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'd go you one
better, brother.</font>

588
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't take that shit
to Miles at all.</font>

589
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:01,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and me work the supplier,</font>

590
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cut's
whatever the fuck
we want it to be.</font>

591
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now, that's
tricky shit, bro,</font>

592
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't know you
