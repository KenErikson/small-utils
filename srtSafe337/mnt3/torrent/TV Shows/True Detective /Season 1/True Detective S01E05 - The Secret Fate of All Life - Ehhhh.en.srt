1
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhh...</font>

2
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to your face?</font>

3
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pool game the other night.</font>

4
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:46,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Called the wrong dude
on cheating.</font>

5
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to watch that.</font>

6
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:54,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want again?</font>

7
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm repping some people.</font>

8
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. They want to get
to the good cook.</font>

9
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll trade you
or the IC Brotherhood,</font>

10
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">however you want to do it,
coke for crystal.</font>

11
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I not talking to Miles?</font>

12
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, me and Ginger go way back,</font>

13
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">boosted together.</font>

14
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't saying much.</font>

15
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figure I let my man
give you the details.</font>

16
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.
This shit I got,</font>

17
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can step on it 5, 6 times.</font>

18
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll still kick.</font>

19
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:27,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just means you got
to cook a little more</font>

20
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a lot more profit.</font>

21
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.</font>

22
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't go no use for it</font>

23
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">or your money.</font>

24
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, money don't spend?</font>

25
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see your soul
at the edges of your eyes.</font>

26
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's corrosive, like acid.</font>

27
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a demon, little man,</font>

28
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:54,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't like your face.</font>

29
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes me want
to do things to it.</font>

30
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:04,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginger, you call me again,
I'm setting Miles on you.</font>

31
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you again,</font>

32
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm putting you down.</font>

33
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a shadow on you, son.</font>

34
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, you got him?</font>

35
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucking better, the
shit I've been though.</font>

36
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. I got him.</font>

37
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on empty roads now.</font>

38
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I got to drop back,
or he'll spot the tail.</font>

39
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. That's
Reggie Ledoux's</font>

40
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">cook partner Dewall.</font>

41
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Birddog him, Marty.</font>

42
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it.</font>

43
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your location?</font>

44
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just south of I-10 along
the Creole Nature Trail</font>

45
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">heading towards Carlyss.</font>

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up, man.</font>

47
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.
On my way.</font>

48
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">How we doing back there, Ginger?</font>

49
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, motherfucker.</font>

50
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!
Yeah.</font>

51
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you get onto Ledoux?</font>

52
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of my old CI's tipped me off</font>

53
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:39,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the location
of his cook house.</font>

54
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I came back on the job.</font>

55
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't want anybody else
to catch him, bring him in.</font>

56
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. You want my help?</font>

57
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just show me the rest
of the file.</font>

58
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so hot to see
the new discovery file, man?</font>

59
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why are y'all...</font>

60
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:04,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">so hot to not give it to me?</font>

61
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:08,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supposed to be like
a consultation, right?</font>

62
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you go first.</font>

63
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take me through it,</font>

64
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll let you
see what we got.</font>

65
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll hold you to that.</font>

66
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Ginger?</font>

67
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:53,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrapped up in a ditch.
What you got?</font>

68
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, lost him and then
had to double back</font>

69
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">a few times till
I found the exit.</font>

70
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's his truck there.</font>

71
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have
to call this in, Rust.</font>

72
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, we don't want to do that.</font>

73
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troops will come,
flood these woods.</font>

74
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">They could scatter.</font>

75
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

76
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ain't gonna
find him from here.</font>

77
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:24,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever been hunting, Marty?</font>

78
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah...</font>

79
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">10-point buck
year before last,</font>

80
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">50 yards.</font>

81
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not talking about
sitting in a treehouse</font>

82
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting to ambush a buck coming</font>

83
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sniff your gash bait.</font>

84
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talking about tracking.</font>

85
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, you're a prick.</font>

86
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. We find the place.
We come back here.</font>

87
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call it in.</font>

88
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us stays
surveillance, yeah?</font>

89
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:50,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can live with that.</font>

90
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

91
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you got a tip</font>

92
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Ledoux cooks,
and Cohle came back</font>

93
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">from wherever he was.</font>

94
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew it was
gonna get here, man.</font>

95
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the once,
the way you tell it.</font>

96
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell it the same way
that I told the shooting board</font>

97
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">and every cop bar
between Houston and Biloxi,</font>

98
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know why the story
is always the same</font>

99
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">17 years gone?</font>

100
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it only went down
the one way.</font>

101
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Rust's dad taught him
bowhunting.</font>

102
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you had
to track game till you got</font>

103
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">within maybe 30 yards of it.</font>

104
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:42,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this enabled us
to discern the suspect's path</font>

105
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:47,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">while sidestepping various
anti-intruder devices</font>

106
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">they installed.</font>

107
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tripwires back there.
Clearing is probably mined.</font>

108
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
How you want to do it?</font>

109
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:18,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go back. Call it in.
I'll wait here.</font>

110
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna hold position?</font>

111
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

112
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:30,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it now, Marty.</font>

113
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

114
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't doing this without me.</font>

115
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Stay low.</font>

116
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just about to turn back,</font>

117
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">call in parish, state, whoever.</font>

118
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we had the location.</font>

119
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had our suspects identified
at the location, you know?</font>

120
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might as well
just leave the shit be</font>

121
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hand it off.</font>

122
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">That ain't what happened.
Hmm.</font>

123
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:17,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. As soon as we started
to back off, man...</font>

124
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blam!</font>

125
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullets cut through
right near Rust's head.</font>

126
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">We dove opposite ways
into the high growth,</font>

127
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they'd already spotted us,</font>

128
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they had something
high-velocity.</font>

129
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:32,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom! Blew apart this tree
between us.</font>

130
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it was on.</font>

131
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Heavy shit...</font>

132
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like ferns and whatnot
bursting all around us,</font>

133
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">bark flying off of trees.</font>

134
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:48,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean we were
in a bucket shitstorm.</font>

135
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

136
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">State police.</font>

137
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your hands on your head.</font>

138
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put them on your head now.</font>

139
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even think about it.</font>

140
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your hands
on your head right now.</font>

141
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intertwine your fingers.</font>

142
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

143
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back up toward me.</font>

144
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:34,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down on your knees.
Go on.</font>

145
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time, isn't it?</font>

146
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">The black stars.</font>

147
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the fuck up.</font>

148
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd spotted us
before we crossed the forest.</font>

149
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:05,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">So all we could do
was duck for cover, dig in,</font>

150
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:09,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">try getting closer.</font>

151
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:12,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was chaos.</font>

152
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">The black stars rise.</font>

153
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:35,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the antlers?</font>

154
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze, motherfucker.</font>

155
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down. Hands up.
State police.</font>

156
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set it down.</font>

157
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:59,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what happens next.</font>

158
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you in my dream.</font>

159
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:05,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in Carcosa now with me.</font>

160
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sees you.</font>

161
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty!</font>

162
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll do this again.</font>

163
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time is a flat circle.</font>

164
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Nietzsche.
Shut the fuck up.</font>

165
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down. Marty!</font>

166
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

167
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black star.</font>

168
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:41,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your hands on your head.</font>

169
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:12,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">While I was hunkered down
behind this old, decrepit boat,</font>

170
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain America Marty Hart</font>

171
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">decides he's gonna run
deep into the woods,</font>

172
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">flank around the back
of the house</font>

173
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Ledoux is firing
at us, right?</font>

174
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he sneaks up behind Ledoux</font>

175
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:26,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just as Ledoux turns,
bam, popped one off in him...</font>

176
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Head shot, clean...
Dropped him.</font>

177
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, his buddy Dewall,
he made a run for it,</font>

178
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his homemade,
cracker-ass security system</font>

179
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">took care of the rest.</font>

180
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck.</font>

181
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the cuffs off him</font>

182
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">before his blood settles.</font>

183
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to make this look right.</font>

184
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn. Fuck.</font>

185
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do, Rust?</font>

186
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck him.</font>

187
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you
commit to something.</font>

188
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go see to the kids.</font>

189
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't bring them out
until I say so.</font>

190
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we confirmed two deaths</font>

191
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">and searched the rest
of the premises,</font>

192
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's when we found
the two children.</font>

193
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we got very lucky.</font>

194
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just as easily
could've been chewed to pieces</font>

195
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">by an AK on approach.</font>

196
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:20,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say that I walked
away from the experience</font>

197
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:27,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a greater respect
for the sanctity of human life.</font>

198
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

199
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, detective.</font>

200
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe I speak for the board</font>

201
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I commend you
on the heroism</font>

202
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">displayed by you
and Detective Hart.</font>

203
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:41,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We were doing
our jobs, sir.</font>

204
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were the twig sculptures</font>

205
00:18:54,398 --> 00:19:00,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the LSD on hand matched
that in Dora Lange.</font>

206
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:06,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody was pretty satisfied
that we got our man.</font>

207
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:17,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy
had been missing since January.</font>

208
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:21,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd been dead less than a day.</font>

209
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl, she hadn't been
reported yet.</font>

210
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:32,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was from St. Landry,
catatonic when we found her.</font>

211
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I live
in history, huh?</font>

212
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, I don't want to know
anything anymore.</font>

213
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a world
where nothing is solved.</font>

214
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:53,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone once told me,
"Time is a flat circle."</font>

215
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything we've ever done
or will do</font>

216
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna do over and over
and over again...</font>

217
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job, y'all.</font>

218
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that little boy
and that little girl,</font>

219
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:08,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're gonna be
in that room again...</font>

220
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">and again...</font>

221
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">and again...</font>

222
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">forever.</font>

223
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cohle, you couldn't
manage to get shot?</font>

224
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time.</font>

225
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for not doubting us.</font>

226
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:25,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never did.</font>

227
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come.
Marty, our hero.</font>

228
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go, boys.</font>

229
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little extra pouring</font>

230
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I finish this up</font>

231
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the semicelebrities?</font>

232
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's plenty of news stories</font>

233
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you care to find them.</font>

234
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:49,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got promoted
to detective sergeant.</font>

235
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:52,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust got a commendation
for bravery,</font>

236
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">basically because I insisted,</font>

237
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">and things were pretty good
for a while, I guess.</font>

238
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Get your speed up.</font>

239
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:12,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. All right.</font>

240
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:23,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie came around.</font>

241
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:26,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just, you know,
a lot of talking, counseling,</font>

242
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:31,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maybe being in a shootout
kind of opened her up</font>

243
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:37,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">to forgiveness
or the possibility.</font>

244
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right to the wall.
Right to the wall.</font>

245
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.
Oh!</font>

246
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.</font>

247
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Go take off your skates.</font>

248
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:46,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to go.
No, no.</font>

249
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please, Mom?
One more time. One more time.</font>

250
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. One more time around,
you take them off, OK?</font>

251
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Daddy coming home yet?</font>

252
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more time around.</font>

253
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. One more time.
One more time.</font>

254
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

255
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
I needed that.</font>

256
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they did, too.</font>

257
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were there others?
What?</font>

258
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides her, were there others?</font>

259
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

260
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:21,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...
and listen.</font>

261
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:23,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a different person.</font>

262
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost it, you know,
just a little.</font>

263
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

264
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm back.
I'm begging.</font>

265
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep begging.</font>

266
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go to my grave begging you.</font>

267
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just the affair.</font>

268
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:44,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used to be a good man.</font>

269
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the booze, 5 weeks now.</font>

270
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in a program...
Promise Keepers.</font>

271
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a long road to climb.</font>

272
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I do.</font>

273
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:20,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few years,</font>

274
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">good ones.</font>

275
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down the line,
one of those setups</font>

276
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie was so intent on
finally hit,</font>

277
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">doctor, no less.</font>

278
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. She and Rust
had a thing, few years.</font>

279
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha!</font>

280
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's
conflict-oriented.</font>

281
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when I deny him
small arguments,</font>

282
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">it builds up his energy.</font>

283
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
Wow.</font>

284
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:50,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Are you ever
a match for this dude.</font>

285
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.
You know about Rust.</font>

286
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:55,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">During those 7 years,
he probably pulled more assists</font>

287
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">than any other detective
in the state.</font>

288
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word got around quick.</font>

289
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a confession,</font>

290
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">see if State Detective Cohle
is available.</font>

291
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your interview technique.</font>

292
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure there isn't some
secret you can pass on?</font>

293
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Everybody knows there's
something wrong with them.</font>

294
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just don't know what it is.</font>

295
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:25,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody wants confession.</font>

296
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody wants
some cathartic narrative for it,</font>

297
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">the guilty especially...</font>

298
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, but everybody is guilty.</font>

299
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the good years
when you're in them,</font>

300
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you just wait for them
until you get ass cancer</font>

301
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">and realize that the good years
came and went?</font>

302
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there's a feeling...
You might notice it sometimes...</font>

303
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:10,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">This feeling like life has
slipped through your fingers...</font>

304
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the future is behind you,</font>

305
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:21,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">like it's always
been behind you.</font>

306
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:28,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I cleaned up,
but maybe I didn't change,</font>

307
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">not the way I needed to.</font>

308
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it back.</font>

309
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:36,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it back!</font>

310
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:39,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what I said
about the detective's curse?</font>

311
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:44,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Solution to my whole life
was right under my nose...</font>

312
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:49,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">That woman, those kids...</font>

313
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:55,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was watching
everything else.</font>

314
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:05,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, infidelity
is one kind of sin,</font>

315
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:10,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my true failure
was inattention.</font>

316
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:14,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that now.</font>

317
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Audrey...
Audrey...</font>

318
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha.</font>

319
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when do you
think things started to,</font>

320
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">how you put it, change again</font>

321
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:03,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Detective Cohle?</font>

322
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:07,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Early on, 2002,
but that was his life.</font>

323
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:11,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine was steady, like I said.</font>

324
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:14,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to understand.</font>

325
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you're going for?</font>

326
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the message?</font>

327
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:22,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no message.
It's just me.</font>

328
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just...</font>

329
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what's just you...</font>

330
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hair, your clothes, your...</font>

331
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I look at Macie...</font>

332
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women don't have to look</font>

333
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you want them to, Dad.</font>

334
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Women,
but I'm talking</font>

335
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">about my teenage daughter,</font>

336
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm not trying to tell you</font>

337
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">what to wear or anything.</font>

338
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying
to understand it.</font>

339
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who told you
you had to understand?</font>

340
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you?</font>

341
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

342
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you made cheerleader.</font>

343
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. There are,
like, 10 other girls</font>

344
00:27:59,009 --> 00:27:59,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">who didn't get it.</font>

345
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:04,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, I didn't know they had
eighth-grade cheerleaders.</font>

346
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:05,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

347
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as there's
football players.</font>

348
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:30,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what
you know about his girl.</font>

349
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Laurie. Yeah.</font>

350
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:37,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">She became chief of something,
Lafayette General, I believe.</font>

351
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what
happened there between them?</font>

352
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:44,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">What always happens
between men and women?</font>

353
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reality.</font>

354
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad...</font>

355
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:12,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell it to your mother.</font>

356
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:30,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputy found her</font>

357
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">parked in a car with two boys.</font>

358
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.
Get over here.</font>

359
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

360
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:48,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, in states
of undress, you know...</font>

361
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">like fucking.</font>

362
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys are 19 and 20.</font>

363
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got them in holding
for the night,</font>

364
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">haven't decided whether to
press stat. Rape charges.</font>

365
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:58,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
You can't do that.</font>

366
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do anything I
goddamn want to those boys.</font>

367
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think about that.</font>

368
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:07,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audrey, look at me.</font>

369
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

370
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
thinking? God.</font>

371
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh,</font>

372
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">or is this one of those things</font>

373
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:20,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'll never understand,</font>

374
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:25,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, being the captain
of the varsity slut team?</font>

375
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:27,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty!</font>

376
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

377
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in your fucking room.</font>

378
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

379
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, she hit my head.</font>

380
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:51,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to bed.
This isn't about you.</font>

381
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:56,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audrey, open the door.</font>

382
00:30:56,153 --> 00:31:00,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door, Audrey.</font>

383
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audrey, it's just
you and me, honey.</font>

384
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">See...</font>

385
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to tell me
what's going on.</font>

386
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audrey, open the door, please.</font>

387
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Years.</font>

388
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever heard
of something called</font>

389
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">the M-brane theory,
detectives?</font>

390
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's
over my head.</font>

391
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like in this universe,</font>

392
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">we process time
linearly forward...</font>

393
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">but outside of our spacetime,</font>

394
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">from what would be a
fourth-dimensional perspective,</font>

395
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">time wouldn't exist,</font>

396
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:56,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">and from that vantage,
could we attain it...</font>

397
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd see...</font>

398
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:05,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">our spacetime would look
flattened,</font>

399
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a single sculpture
with matter</font>

400
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:12,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a superposition of
every place it ever occupied,</font>

401
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:17,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">our sentience just
cycling through our lives</font>

402
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:22,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">like carts on a track.</font>

403
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, everything
outside our dimension...</font>

404
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:34,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's eternity,</font>

405
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">eternity looking down on us.</font>

406
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:42,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, to us,</font>

407
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a sphere,</font>

408
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to them...</font>

409
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:51,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a circle.</font>

410
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cohle?</font>

411
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:12,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cohle, what
happened in 2002?</font>

412
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy Leonard Francis.</font>

413
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:22,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say you killed two people
in Livingston.</font>

414
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:27,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say you're
a drug store robber.</font>

415
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:31,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know they already
got a nickname for you?</font>

416
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:37,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Southern Fried Pharmacy
Firearm Thief.</font>

417
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like that?</font>

418
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a nice ring to it,
a bit of a mouthful.</font>

419
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, telling you, man,</font>

420
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">the shit they got these days...</font>

421
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:47,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technology, fingerprints, DNA...</font>

422
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:49,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to be a fucking genius</font>

423
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get past that shit.</font>

424
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's face it, Francis.</font>

425
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't no fucking
genius, are you?</font>

426
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, you come in and say,</font>

427
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:58,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I got the drugs
from somewhere else."</font>

428
00:33:58,135 --> 00:33:59,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you say, "No.
I don't remember.</font>

429
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:03,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember
where I got the drugs."</font>

430
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making it
too complicated.</font>

431
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're creating
a maze for yourself</font>

432
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:07,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you ain't never
gonna get out of.</font>

433
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got you.</font>

434
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just got
to change your play.</font>

435
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to plead impairment.</font>

436
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what that means?</font>

437
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means that you
cannot be held</font>

438
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:23,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">accountable for your actions.</font>

439
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't think
I ought to be blamed...</font>

440
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:29,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, entirely blamed...
For things I did</font>

441
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was under the
influence of anything.</font>

442
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
you should, either.</font>

443
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm saying.</font>

444
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:41,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">PCP. Stuff makes
a man crazy.</font>

445
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time, famous case,</font>

446
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">guy, he cut off his own
face on that shit.</font>

447
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real?
Hell yeah.</font>

448
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mix that with meth,</font>

449
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's an insanity defense</font>

450
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I ever heard one.</font>

451
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you gonna say a man
who's not on anything</font>

452
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:57,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">is insane because he
did something crazy</font>

453
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a man who's on something</font>

454
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">that made him crazy is sane?</font>

455
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean?</font>

456
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Works both ways.
Yeah, exactly.</font>

457
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm not even saying
that I remember anything.</font>

458
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was shit hammered.</font>

459
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:08,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

460
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your play right there.</font>

461
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck this amnesia story.</font>

462
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:18,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dirt don't stick,
but an insanity defense,</font>

463
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's your ticket.</font>

464
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your way out, all right,</font>

465
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're sobered up now.</font>

466
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got your mind right.</font>

467
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You back.</font>

468
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to show them
the difference</font>

469
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:34,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">between that madman
in that pharmacy</font>

470
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:36,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">who blew them two people away</font>

471
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:40,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the man who's
sitting here right now.</font>

472
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to show shock,</font>

473
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">terror, and
re-fucking-morse.</font>

474
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am. I do. I'm...</font>

475
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared, sir.
Oh, yeah.</font>

476
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be, right?</font>

477
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. What'd you say
to the pharmacist?</font>

478
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:02,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said,
"Give me everything."</font>

479
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then what?
Boom. Boom.</font>

480
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:09,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blew that fucker
away, didn't you?</font>

481
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want forgiveness for that?</font>

482
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Say it.</font>

483
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:20,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want it.
You want what?</font>

484
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgiveness.</font>

485
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see what you just did?</font>

486
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:34,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just copped
to a double murder.</font>

487
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:39,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got you now.</font>

488
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

489
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to make a deal.</font>

490
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">A deal about what?</font>

491
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know things.</font>

492
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what you know
now all of a sudden?</font>

493
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:00,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know...</font>

494
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who you are, and I know</font>

495
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">about that woman y'all
found out in the woods</font>

496
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:09,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">way back, the antlers.</font>

497
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

498
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:14,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">That don't mean shit.</font>

499
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was in the newspaper.</font>

500
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you know?</font>

501
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know shit, do you?</font>

502
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:25,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Y'all never caught
the man that did that.</font>

503
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been out there killing.</font>

504
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking
out your ass, boy.</font>

505
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know a fucking thing.</font>

506
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just trying
to buy some time,</font>

507
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">ain't you?</font>

508
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met him once.</font>

509
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's big people
who know about him,</font>

510
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">big people.</font>

511
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, ain't no deal</font>

512
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:47,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">because there ain't no people.</font>

513
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make me a deal.</font>

514
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:50,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deal with me
with these murders.</font>

515
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't no deal.
You ain't got nothing</font>

516
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're full of shit,</font>

517
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there ain't nobody alive</font>

518
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">that did none of that killing.</font>

519
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead, boy.</font>

520
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:04,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you about
the Yellow King.</font>

521
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck you say, boy?</font>

522
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:15,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a name.</font>

523
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a fucking name.</font>

524
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to fucking play, boy?</font>

525
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Yellow King!</font>

526
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Aah!</font>

527
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the hell off me!
Get off me!</font>

528
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off of me!</font>

529
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:31,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal with me,
you son of a bitch.</font>

530
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deal with me!
I want a deal!</font>

531
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy. Come on, man.</font>

532
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:38,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down, dude.</font>

533
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now take a deep
breath, all right?</font>

534
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:41,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got the confession.</font>

535
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:42,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you made it inadmissible.</font>

536
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you fucking mean?
He's still talking.</font>

537
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:45,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shucking and jiving.
He knows exactly who you are.</font>

538
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called me in here, huh?
You did.</font>

539
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, and if we need
anything else,</font>

540
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:49,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll let you know.</font>

541
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">We appreciate the
assist, detective.</font>

542
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is going on here?</font>

543
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:53,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to salvage
a double murder</font>

544
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">confession, is what's going on.</font>

545
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wasn't just
running you in there,</font>

546
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll get anything we get.</font>

547
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have my word.</font>

548
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Ease up, baby.
Calm down.</font>

549
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:05,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll be back...</font>

550
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I got it.</font>

551
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:07,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow.</font>

552
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay the fuck back.
I got it.</font>

553
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:39,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">In eternity,
where there is no time,</font>

554
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">nothing can grow.</font>

555
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing can become.</font>

556
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing changes.</font>

557
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">So death created time</font>

558
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">to grow the things
that it would kill...</font>

559
00:39:56,992 --> 00:40:00,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are reborn</font>

560
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">but into the same life</font>

561
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you've always
been born into.</font>

562
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, how many times have we</font>

563
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">had this conversation,
detectives?</font>

564
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who knows?</font>

565
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:19,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you can't remember
your lives,</font>

566
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't change your lives,</font>

567
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:30,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that is the terrible
and the secret fate of all life.</font>

568
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:35,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trapped...</font>

569
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:41,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">by that nightmare
you keep waking up into.</font>

570
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:49,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

571
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:51,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to go to Abbeville.</font>

572
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I got a deposition
this afternoon.</font>

573
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:56,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, push it.</font>

574
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got somebody
we need to talk to.</font>

575
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you on the way.</font>

576
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

577
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think he's serious</font>

578
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:07,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">about having something,</font>

579
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:11,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if so, then what?</font>

580
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:17,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie Ledoux deserved
to die, Marty.</font>

581
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was justice.</font>

582
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not ruling out
other agencies.</font>

583
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
What does that mean?</font>

584
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy Francis and Charlie Lange</font>

585
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">both say the Yellow King.</font>

586
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:36,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora Lange said the Yellow King.</font>

587
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:40,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Look.</font>

588
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the killer
is still out there,</font>

589
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">why haven't there
been more killings?</font>

590
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe there have, Marty,</font>

591
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we just don't
know about them,</font>

592
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:52,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">hadn't put them together.</font>

593
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever wonder why that task force</font>

594
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:58,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">was so hot to take
the case back in '95?</font>

595
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha!</font>

596
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:02,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you telling me you
think the task force</font>

597
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">was in on it?</font>

598
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

599
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the fuck does this happen?</font>

600
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew what he was looking
at with the double murders.</font>

601
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess he thought about it
and made a choice.</font>

602
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a camera feed?</font>

603
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:45,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.
Go back. Play this.</font>

604
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:49,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took a phone call
at 7:15, his lawyer.</font>

605
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:13,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got audio on this, sound?</font>

606
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, just the vid.</font>

607
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, just
3 hours of nothing...</font>

608
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">till you see the blood.</font>

609
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:39,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know what somebody
might have told him</font>

610
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:40,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">on that phone call.</font>

611
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see your

<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

613
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are the two
officers' names?</font>

614
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Childress and Mahoney.</font>

615
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me their files, please.</font>

616
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

617
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrence, get prints on this.</font>

618
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:22,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

619
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prints?
That's a public phone.</font>

620
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:28,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">No kind of lawyer
makes calls from here.</font>

621
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:30,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Francis have relatives?</font>

622
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... sisters, a few
nieces, nephews.</font>

623
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connects to the suicide how?</font>

624
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:40,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody might have
told him something,</font>

625
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">gave him no choice.</font>

626
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, great.</font>

627
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when he got
going on this thing again,</font>

628
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">did he mention Billy Lee Tuttle?</font>

629
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that he did.</font>

630
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:58,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tuttle died a
couple years back, 2010.</font>

631
00:44:58,394 --> 00:44:59,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

632
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:02,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that,
mixed medications? So what?</font>

633
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right after Cohle showed
back up in the state.</font>

634
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:11,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck this.</font>

635
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck this bullshit.</font>

636
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me right now</font>

637
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:17,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you're all over Cohle,
or I'll walk.</font>

638
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:41,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">His record, his reports,</font>

639
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">his stories, they don't add up.</font>

640
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:45,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">So talk to him about it already.</font>

641
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop pissing in my ear.</font>

642
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:47,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did.</font>

643
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you did?
What?</font>

644
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:54,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you two talked to Rust,</font>

645
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">you weren't getting
a read on him.</font>

646
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was getting a read on you.</font>

647
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:40,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all you got?</font>

648
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:43,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, I already know all this.</font>

649
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That what we have so far.</font>

650
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:47,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hadn't checked
old unsolveds.</font>

651
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you stop dancing with us.</font>

652
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:52,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what you
really been up to,</font>

653
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">how you spend your time.</font>

654
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:57,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already told you
how I spend my time.</font>

655
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:58,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except you've been
bullshitting us</font>

656
00:47:58,942 --> 00:47:59,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">all afternoon.</font>

657
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse us for
one minute, please.</font>

658
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are from the crime
scene in Lake Charles</font>

659
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:20,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">once folks got word.</font>

660
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:27,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Recognize anybody in there?</font>

661
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lake Charles
is a bit out of the way</font>

662
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you, ain't it?</font>

663
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you keep her
out of the papers?</font>

664
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:37,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you got some friends
in high places?</font>

665
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your truck and a man
fitting your description</font>

666
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">was spotted in the vicinity</font>

667
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">of our crime scene 5 times</font>

668
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:49,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">by 5 different people
over the last month.</font>

669
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, besides people seeing him</font>

670
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his truck around
the location for weeks,</font>

671
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know he was off the grid
after he left in '02,</font>

672
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:07,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't show up anywhere
till 2010... Louisiana.</font>

673
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got his driver's
license renewed.</font>

674
00:50:10,172 --> 00:50:12,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody knows what
he's been doing</font>

675
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:14,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the meantime.</font>

676
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a storage
shed near Church Point.</font>

677
00:50:17,313 --> 00:50:20,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't let us see
what's inside.</font>

678
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you let us see</font>

679
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you're keeping in storage?</font>

680
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck no. You can't see
my storage unit.</font>

681
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a warrant.</font>

682
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, try working a case.</font>

683
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:51,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are working it.</font>

684
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:51,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

685
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, how we work it is,
we think way back,</font>

686
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">you put the case
on Rianne Olivier,</font>

687
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">put it on her old boyfriend.</font>

688
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

689
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the Ledoux boys knew you.</font>

690
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you traveled
the same circles,</font>

691
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">got the same hobbies.</font>

692
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:07,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they had something on you.</font>

693
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:09,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just kept
pulling the right old murders,</font>

694
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">take the case wherever
you wanted it to go.</font>

695
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a juicer.
Ever black out?</font>

696
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever wake up, don't
remember what happened?</font>

697
00:51:25,713 --> 00:51:31,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Y'all want to arrest me,
go ahead.</font>

698
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to follow me,</font>

699
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">come on.</font>

700
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:39,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to see something,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">get a warrant.</font>

702
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the beer.</font>

703
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:51,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beyond that, you wasted
my fucking day, company man.</font>

704
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:38,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, he bartends 4 days a week,</font>

705
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">this roadhouse,</font>

706
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:40,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">has a little
apartment behind it.</font>

707
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:43,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">No other accounting
of this time.</font>

708
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says he drinks.</font>

709
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong.</font>

710
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody could change that much.
You are dead wrong.</font>

711
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you've
been telling us all day</font>

712
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:54,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the kind of shit
he'd think up,</font>

713
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:55,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way he'd talk.</font>

714
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a good earful
of that, too.</font>

715
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna tell me</font>

716
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's a stable individual?</font>

717
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:01,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Left a burnout, junkie rumors.</font>

718
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think 10
years on the sauce</font>

719
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">has made him more reasonable?</font>

720
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:07,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about this.
You said it.</font>

721
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd been there 3 months,</font>

722
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:10,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you two catch a heater</font>

723
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you've never
had before or since,</font>

724
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">one that he shines on.</font>

725
00:53:15,257 --> 00:53:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying he did
such a great job.</font>

726
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't he get you
every bit of evidence?</font>

727
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't he push you
where he wanted it to go?</font>

728
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">He brought you Rianne Olivier.</font>

729
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't one of Ledoux's.</font>

730
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:29,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was one of his.</font>

731
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd he say,
"Life is a disease"?</font>

732
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he heard the Abbeville
prisoner Francis</font>

733
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:36,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">knew something, he got on it.</font>

734
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:37,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shut it down.</font>

735
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever thought if he made</font>

736
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">that phone call to the prisoner,</font>

737
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:40,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">like... I don't know...</font>

738
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:42,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy was trying
to blackmail him?</font>

739
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got on that, too, didn't he,</font>

740
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:47,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">the idea that the Lange
killer was still out there?</font>

741
00:53:49,992 --> 00:53:51,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

742
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:53,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. He did.</font>

743
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking for a new patsy, maybe.</font>

744
00:54:39,574 --> 00:54:41,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all given me a lot to absorb.</font>

745
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn right
it's a lot to absorb.</font>

746
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:46,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">So help us out.
Yeah.</font>

747
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you can tell us</font>

748
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">about, you know,
from when he got</font>

749
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:52,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the Lange killer
you up to when</font>

750
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">you two had your altercation.</font>

751
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever that was about.</font>
