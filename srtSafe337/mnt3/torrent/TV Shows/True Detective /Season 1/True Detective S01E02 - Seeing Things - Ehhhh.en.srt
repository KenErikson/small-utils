<font color="#FFFFFF">Back then, I'd sleep and</font>

2
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd lay awake thinking
about women.</font>

3
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter... my wife.</font>

4
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:51,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's like... something's
just got your name on it,</font>

5
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a bullet</font>

6
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:56,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a nail in the road.</font>

7
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

8
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. I drift...</font>

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes when I've
had a few. That's...</font>

10
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I like
to drink alone.</font>

11
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">One reason, anyway.</font>

12
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:14,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">About that
sculpture thing.
Hmm.</font>

13
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of strange
it turns up like that</font>

14
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">years later.</font>

15
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, nobody knew why
that thing was in the playhouse.</font>

16
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:29,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the aunt reckoned
maybe it was something</font>

17
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">she made in school, you know?</font>

18
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">VOICE-To me,
it was like someone was</font>

19
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">having a conversation, you know?</font>

20
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:49,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl's... school
shut down in '92.</font>

21
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It closed down after Andrew.</font>

22
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">That mean anything to you?</font>

23
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we notified
the deceased's mother.</font>

24
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:10,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember the last time</font>

25
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">you saw your daughter Dora?</font>

26
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:17,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">VOICE-It was
a horrible, horrible thing.</font>

27
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw it on TV,</font>

28
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we're in the clutches of,</font>

29
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I prayed and prayed
for that woman's family.</font>

30
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's me.</font>

31
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me.</font>

32
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Kelly.
Hmm?</font>

33
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about her father?</font>

34
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they have a relationship?</font>

35
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
What have you heard?</font>

36
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard he passed.
Is that correct?</font>

37
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't a father
bathe his own child?</font>

38
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

39
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">We, uh, we were just wondering</font>

40
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">how they got on, ma'am.</font>

41
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">He died on the road.</font>

42
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">He drove a Peterbilt,</font>

43
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he took an exit too fast.</font>

44
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:09,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rolled over
near Rowan, Oklahoma.</font>

45
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">May 11, 1984.</font>

46
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was the last time
you talked to her?</font>

47
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.</font>

48
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought things were
getting better.</font>

49
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got away from Charlie.</font>

50
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">She came by not too
long ago, maybe a month.</font>

51
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't talk
about her daddy none.</font>

52
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said she'd been going to church.</font>

53
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:32,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you, um,</font>

54
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you remember where
that church was?</font>

55
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:38,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...
Mrs. Kelly?</font>

56
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

57
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

58
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.</font>

00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:50,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail Mary, full of grace.</font>

00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Kelly...</font>

00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I get
these headaches.</font>

62
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like storms. Oh.</font>

63
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worked in dry-cleaning
for 20 years.</font>

64
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chemicals.</font>

65
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what's wrong
with my nails.</font>

66
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:14,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piece of work, huh?</font>

67
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:17,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother...
Donna Reed type.</font>

68
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Packed lunches,</font>

00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:23,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">bedtime stories.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom still alive?</font>

71
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

72
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cohle ever talk
about his parents?</font>

73
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:41,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">VOICE-No.
Little bit about his dad.</font>

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alaska, 'Nam.</font>

75
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:47,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, my dad, I had
about 6 inches on him,</font>

76
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even in the end,</font>

77
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still think
he could have taken me.</font>

78
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Marines, Korea.</font>

79
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never talked about it.</font>

80
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there was a time that</font>

81
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">men didn't air their
bullshit to the world.</font>

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it just wasn't
a part of their job.</font>

83
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

84

89
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:28,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we talked to the victim's
friend next, I believe.</font>

90
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Carla?</font>

91
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess she always
had her mom's place,</font>

92
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh, I thought
maybe she'd gotten
into somethin',</font>

93
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, like, uh,
like gamin' again.</font>

00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Havin' a rough time.</font>

about? How was she?</font>

96
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thin, loopy,</font>

97
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">like high,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">usually on somethin'.</font>

99
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:57,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says she
found a church,
but, uh... heh!</font>

100
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her eyes.</font>

00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somethin' wrong with 'em.</font>

102
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:04,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, do you remember
where this church was?</font>

103
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

104
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:09,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where she might
have been staying?</font>

105
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her landlord said she'd
moved out last summer.</font>

106
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I stopped
seein' her so much.</font>

107
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">She mentioned someplace
down south,</font>

108
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">like around Spanish Lake, a...</font>

109
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:24,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">shelter, girls used
to stay there,</font>

110
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">something, all she said.</font>

111
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sounds sad, Marty,</font>

113
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a torn-up person

114
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:40,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was just
an easy target for him.</font>

123
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know what
tweakers get up to.</font>

124
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,213

in New Orleans</font>

125
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">cut up his girl, felt remorse,</font>

00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, that's not this.
This has scope.</font>

129
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, she articulated
a person with vision.</font>

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vision is meaning.
Meaning is historical.</font>

131
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:24,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, she was just chum
in the water, man.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Days of nothing.</font>

133
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:44,553

you work cases.</font>

134
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:51,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Days like lost dogs.</font>

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goes on like that.</font>

136
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the job.</font>

137
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're looking for narrative,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, I don't know.</font>

148
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I had
sobered up a little.</font>

149
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:00,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, it wasn't
as bad as I thought.</font>

150
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">And being around your family,</font>

151
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I liked talking to them.</font>

152

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bad"?
Why'd you think that?</font>

153
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:15,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was married, Marty,
for 3 years.</font>

154

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died.</font>

156
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Car accident.
She was two years old.</font>

157
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marriage couldn't handle it.</font>

158
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:31,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your kid died?</font>

159
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:36,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I...</font>

160
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:39,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, man.
I am so sorry.
I didn't...</font>

161
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean, it wasn't
you guys. It was just me.</font>

162
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:47,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was worried...</font>

163
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:50,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, being around
that kind of thing.</font>

164
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you were married
the once, just the once?</font>

165
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:57,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">VOICE-Uh-huh.
Came close another time.</font>

166
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Laurie.</font>

167
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:07,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie introduced us,</font>

168
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it... it broke off.</font>

169
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was for the best, you know.
I gave her cause.</font>

170
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:18,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can be hard to live
with. You know, I...</font>

171
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:22,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mean to,
but I can be... critical.</font>

172
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:25,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sometimes
I think I'm just
not good for people,</font>

173
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:30,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, that it's
not good for them
to be around me.</font>

174
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:34,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I...
I wear 'em down,</font>

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, they...</font>

176
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:40,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">they get unhappy.
Hmm.</font>

177
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I think the job does
that to a lot of guys.</font>

178
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Changes you. Some guys
just notice, that's all.</font>

179
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I can't say
the job made me
this way.</font>

180
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:55,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">More like me being this way
made me right for the job.</font>

181
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I used to...</font>

182
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">think about it more, but...</font>

183
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know,
you reach a certain age,
you know who you are.</font>

184
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I live in a little room</font>

185
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">out in the country,
behind a bar.</font>

186
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:15,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work 4 nights a week;
in between, I drink,</font>

187
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:20,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there ain't
nobody there to stop me.</font>

188
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:25,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who I am.</font>

189
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:29,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all these years,
there's a...</font>

190
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a victory in that.</font>

191
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Third day
on the job,</font>

192
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:38,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">stopped this cutie for speeding.</font>

193
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">52 minutes later,
back in her dorm room.</font>

194
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my...</font>

195
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">uniform around my knees.</font>

196
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! I'm occupied,</font>

197
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:51,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I don't hear
anything.</font>

198
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:55,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know that her
roommate has come home</font>

199
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">and snuck up behind us.
Oh, shit.</font>

200
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how I knew that
she was in the room?</font>

201
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">She stuck her finger up my ass!</font>

202
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ruined me. Now I can't
do without it.</font>

203
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You miss some things on the job.</font>

204
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean.</font>

205
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to... decompress</font>

206
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:24,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">before you can go being
a family man.</font>

207
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you get into working,</font>

208
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:31,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't have
the kids around that.</font>

209
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:36,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, um, sometimes you got
to get your head right.</font>

210
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I stop by?</font>

211
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Where are you?</font>

212
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elks.</font>

213
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're drunk.</font>

214
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:45,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not,</font>

215
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've hardly had
anything to drink.</font>

216
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never hardly have
anything to drink.</font>

217
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a surprise for you.</font>

218
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?</font>

219
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

220
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a yes?</font>

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh, might stay up.</font>

222
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

223
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for your wife
and kids, too.</font>

224
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to take your release
where you find it</font>

225
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">or where it finds you.</font>

226
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:23,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, in the end, it's for
the good of the family.</font>

227
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:44,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

228
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, I, uh,</font>

229
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">got you a present.</font>

230
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move a muscle.</font>

231
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shan't.
Just the fingers.</font>

232
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The finger muscles.</font>

233
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:17,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

234
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, stop.</font>

235
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're very naughty.</font>

236
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

237
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the right
to remain silent.</font>

238
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:35,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you say</font>

239
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:39,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">can and will
be held against you
in a court of law.</font>

240
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:42,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the right
to an attorney.</font>

241
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can't afford an attorney,</font>

242
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">the state will provide you one.</font>

243
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand your rights?</font>

244
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">You definitely
have a career
in law enforcement.</font>

245
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:59,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I thought I was
gonna put these on you.</font>

246
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want this?
Ah.</font>

247
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

248
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want it?</font>

249
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

250
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

251
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

252
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:06,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what do you mean, exactly,
these visions you mentioned?</font>

253
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. I thought you knew.</font>

254
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:14,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.</font>

255
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, chemical... flashbacks,</font>

256
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">neural damage, you know,</font>

257
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">from my time in the HIDTA:</font>

258
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:33,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">as in High-Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area.</font>

259
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:49,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent 4 years undercover.</font>

260
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:53,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what that means?</font>

261
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:58,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where they got them
Fed rumors, I first come in.</font>

262
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:03,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you two
don't know about them?</font>

263
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:07,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those files are still
sealed, huh?</font>

264
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shee-it.</font>

265
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:16,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just what have you two
heard about me?</font>

266
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted blues?</font>

267
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quaaludes.</font>

268
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Downers?
Dopey stuff.</font>

269
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
What's it run?</font>

270
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking blue go
for three a pill.</font>

271
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:05,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll say 200 for the bottle.</font>

272
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might
just take 'em.</font>

273
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:19,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or that you wanted
somethin' else.</font>

274
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some kind of somethin' else?</font>

275
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:30,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

276
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man.</font>

277
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't need
a shakedown to get some.</font>

278
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:44,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about
rough trade,
scary guys?</font>

279
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You girls talk.</font>

280
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Around here, they're rough</font>

281
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">or whiskey-limp.</font>

282
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seen plenty of guys
that get touchy.</font>

283
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something sets them off
and they're like
little boys.</font>

284
00:19:55,993 --> 00:19:59,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">People always go away
around here.</font>

285
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where would I look,</font>

286
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:05,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">working girls might know
the blonde?</font>

287
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:10,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she was gaming I-10
south side, I heard
of this place.</font>

288
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of trailer park.</font>

289
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls work and stay.
They call it "The Ranch."</font>

290
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:18,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's that?</font>

291
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, south of Spanish Lake,</font>

292
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">supposed to be.</font>

293
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the place?</font>

294
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your deal?</font>

295
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a deal.</font>

296
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what do you do?</font>

297
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind. I thought
you were gonna bust me.</font>

298
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, I'm not interested.</font>

299
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know.</font>

300
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kinda strange,</font>

301
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you might be dangerous.</font>

302
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, of course I'm dangerous.</font>

303
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm police.</font>

304
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could do
terrible things
to people...</font>

305
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">with impunity.</font>

306
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
what'd you do
last night?</font>

307
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I called up here late.</font>

308
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you doing?</font>

309
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Working.</font>

310
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was thinking about dropping by.</font>

311
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you?</font>

312
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was out with girlfriends.</font>

313
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh. Well,
I don't like that.</font>

314
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you're jealous?</font>

315
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be stupid.</font>

316
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just mean that there's</font>

317
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">a crazy man out there,</font>

318
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's killing women.</font>

319
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:40,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, you mean that girl
again, that Satanic thing?</font>

320
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's still
talking about that
at the courthouse.</font>

321
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just her.</font>

322
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more.</font>

323
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:51,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more?
Really?</font>

324
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:54,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, we're not saying,</font>

325
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">keeping it out
of the press, but...</font>

326
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:02,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're thinking that
he's been doing this
a while.</font>

327
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

328
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so no need to go out.</font>

329
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just have a drink here.</font>

330
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't meet a nice man at home.</font>

331
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hurts me</font>

332
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:24,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you speak to me
in a passive-
aggressive way.</font>

333
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always talk straight to you.</font>

334
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:30,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. I meant that
since you're married,</font>

335
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be
considering my options
as a young woman.</font>

336
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want things, Marty.</font>

337
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want things, too.</font>

338
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you just want your cake</font>

339
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:47,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to eat it, too.</font>

340
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">How good is cake</font>

341
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:54,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can't eat it?</font>

342
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

343
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:07,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning.</font>

344
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:11,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I think I might have
found something good.</font>

345
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bunny ranch down south,</font>

346
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">round Spanish Lake.</font>

347
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were
pulling old johns today.</font>

348
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:22,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we should do this first.</font>

349
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:25,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

350
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wash up.
You got some pussy on you.</font>

351
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Key to a healthy marriage.</font>

352
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's Maggie, huh?</font>

353
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:41,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

354
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:44,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with your fucking nose?</font>

355
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:48,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing, man.
Sorry. Forget it.</font>

356
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:52,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get a connotation
being implied here</font>

357
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">about my wife?</font>

358
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:57,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that's wife,
that high tide you're
walking in with?</font>

359
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got some idea</font>

360
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">how my wife's pussy's
supposed to smell?</font>

361
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:07,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I just meant you're
wearing the same clothes
as you did yesterday,</font>

362
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:11,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">coupled with the fact
that I ain't stupid.</font>

363
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't making no comment
as to the...</font>

364
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:18,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">particularity of the scent.</font>

365
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:22,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't say fuck-all
about my wife.</font>

366
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:25,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say her name.</font>

367
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:29,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got
some self-loathing to do
this morning, that's fine,</font>

368
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:33,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it ain't worth
losing your hands over.</font>

369
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would that work, exactly?</font>

370
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:41,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,</font>

371
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:43,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">snap your wrists.</font>

372
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Senior Detective.</font>

373
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:51,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think I'm lying?</font>

374
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a specific
location for this place</font>

375
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:39,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are we just gonna
wander around
till we find it?</font>

376
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:41,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got some names.</font>

377
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:45,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to ask
for directions.</font>

378
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:51,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you could just
follow your nose.</font>

379
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:56,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wherever he picked them up,</font>

380
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:58,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I won't lie.</font>

381
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">However we left it,</font>

382
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had some moves.</font>

383
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:07,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew a few Cis
from his narco days.</font>

384
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">They knew these parts,
put us in touch</font>

385
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:14,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">with some names,
people to talk to.</font>

386
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">How we doing, boys?</font>

387
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Hello.</font>

388
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for
a little bunny ranch</font>

389
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">down around these parts.</font>

390
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:23,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all know where
we could find it?</font>

391
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.
Never heard
about it?</font>

392
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little whorehouse?
Nuh-uh.</font>

393
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:29,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, man.</font>

394
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Supposed to be stuck up
in the woods around here?</font>

395
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll tell you this,</font>

396
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust had about as sharp
an eye for weakness</font>

397
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">as I ever seen.</font>

398
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:47,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

399
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my bad, boys.</font>

400
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think we got started
on the wrong foot there.</font>

401
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

402
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

403
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:08,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember where that
little whorehouse is, huh?</font>

404
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take 353 South.</font>

405
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.</font>

406
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:33,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">From there, we take
a dirt fishing road
to Bayou Chenault.</font>

407
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

408
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it?</font>

409
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:17,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

410
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:33,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cop car, y'all.</font>

411
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just trying to get
some freebies.</font>

412
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't do no cops...</font>

413
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:53,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, ma'am.</font>

414
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:58,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Martin Hart,
Rustin Cohle... State CID.</font>

415
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">This your place?</font>

416
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my lease.</font>

417
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this, some kind
of hillbilly bunny ranch?</font>

418
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:08,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

419
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might want to talk
to Sheriff Bilson</font>

420
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">'fore you start tossin'
accusations around.</font>

421
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I ain't got nothing
against hillbillies.</font>

422
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.
That's not why
we're here. We, uh,</font>

423
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, something
happened to a girl,</font>

424
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:22,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we need
to know if any
of you knew her.</font>

425
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:31,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. That's Dori.</font>

426
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somethin' happened?</font>

427
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:38,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know about
that woman found
outside of Erath?</font>

428
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

429
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did something
happen to Dori?</font>

430
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:50,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you pretty good
friends with her?</font>

431
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:53,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was nice to me when
I first came around.</font>

432
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gave me tips and stuff.</font>

433
00:29:56,826 --> 00:30:01,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tips? About what?</font>

434
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:05,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothin'.</font>

435
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:09,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, just how to be.</font>

436
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:18,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got any idea where
she might have been staying
the last few weeks?</font>

437
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't.</font>

438
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:23,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her ex is in prison.</font>

439
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:27,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess maybe
she got a new place.</font>

440
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd been going to church.</font>

441
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping maybe
she just turned
things around.</font>

442
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:40,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need
to question any girls
might have known her.</font>

443
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a tougher ask
than you think.</font>

444
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folks'll be stayin' away,
they hear y'all
are out here.</font>

445
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:50,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, ma'am,
it's the best way
to get us to leave.</font>

446
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said she left a bag.</font>

447
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

448
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:00,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see it?</font>

449
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

450
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:19,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">That girl's not 18.</font>

451
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sheriff know you got
underage working here?</font>

452
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know
about where
that girl's been,</font>

453
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">where she come from?</font>

454
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know
Beth's situation,</font>

455
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">'fore she ran out on her uncle?</font>

456
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are other places
she could go.</font>

457
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:41,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such holy bullshit from you.</font>

458
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:43,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a woman's body, ain't it?</font>

459
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:45,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman's choice.</font>

460
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she don't look
like a woman to me.</font>

461
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">At that age, she is not equipped</font>

462
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make those kind of choices.</font>

463
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:55,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I guess
you don't give a shit
what kind of damage</font>

464
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's doing to herself,
as long as you're
making your money.</font>

465
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:02,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls walk this earth
all the time</font>

466
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">screwin' for free.</font>

467
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, why is it you add
business to the mix,</font>

468
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">and boys like you can't
stand the thought?</font>

469
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you.</font>

470
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 'cause suddenly
you don't own it</font>

471
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way you thought you did.</font>

472
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:22,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

473
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:26,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.</font>

474
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be in touch.</font>

475
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, thank you...</font>

476
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your help.</font>

477
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do something else.</font>

478
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:01,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">That a down payment?</font>

479
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:05,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is shitting on
any moment of decency</font>

480
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:09,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">part of your job description?</font>

483
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:20,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is her diary, Marty.</font>

484
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe this shit.</font>

485
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl that young.</font>

00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:28,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the sheriff
has got a stake
in this place, too.</font>

487
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,805

00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:49,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fried her brain on
whatever she was on.</font>

493
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like she
didn't have much
to begin with.</font>

494
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:56,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it reads like a fantasy.</font>

495
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he was
dosing her regular,</font>

496
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and over a period of time,
upping the dose</font>

497
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">little by little
without her knowing it?</font>

498
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should stay out here
today, check around</font>

499
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">for johns</font>

500
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe knew her.</font>

501
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.</font>

502
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:17,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

503
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, a lot of these type places.</font>

504
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:24,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expect the flock
to canvass for 'em.</font>

505
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we should go there.</font>

506
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be the church
everyone mentioned.</font>

507
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's check
around for johns
while we're out here</font>

508
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pick up the church
on Monday.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of your stuff's
still redacted.</font>

510
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what's Northshore?</font>

511
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Northshore Psychiatric Hospital,</font>

512
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lubbock, Texas.</font>

513
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent 4 months there in '93.</font>

514
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:54,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel like talking
about that?
Well, sure.</font>

515
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:57,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gives a shit?</font>

516
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:03,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sofia... my daughter.</font>

517
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was on her tricycle</font>

518
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">in our driveway. Um...</font>

519
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:20,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lived down a...
where a little bend
in the road, and...</font>

520
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said that...</font>

521
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:31,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, afterwards, uh,</font>

522
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:34,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Claire and I turned
on each other, you know?</font>

523
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:38,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">We... we resented each other</font>

524
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">being alive, you know?</font>

525
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:48,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I transferred
from robbery to narco.</font>

526
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:52,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Started hitting it,
you know, 24/7.</font>

527
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Street rips, knocking down
doors, and within 3 months</font>

528
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was ripping off couriers
or ending up in a Ramada Inn</font>

529
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a couple
of fuckin' eight-balls.</font>

530
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

531
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:10,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhere in there, Claire left,</font>

532
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">and somewhere in there,</font>

533
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I emptied a 9 into a crankhead</font>

534
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:20,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.</font>

535
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:24,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said he was trying
to purify her.</font>

536
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">State attorney gave me
one chance to stay out
of jail.</font>

537
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:32,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, "You can keep
your profile, but we want to
make you our wild man junkie."</font>

538
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they did. They made me
a floater, like a trick.</font>

539
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:41,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, any agency
or department needed
a deep undercover narco,</font>

540
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:42,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">they got me,</font>

541
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there was no fuckin'
expiration date, baby.</font>

542
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they kept you
out there for 4 years?</font>

543
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

544
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, February of '93,</font>

545
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:57,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed 3 cartel men
in Port Houston.</font>

546
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took three 25s
in the side and ended up</font>

547
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">at Northshore Psychiatric
Hospital in Lubbock, Texas,</font>

548
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is kind of funny
in its own rite...</font>

549
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psych ward being
in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!</font>

550
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:15,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever been there?
They offered me
a psych pension.</font>

551
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackpot, right?</font>

552
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said no.</font>

553
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "Put me
on homicide somewhere."</font>

554
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">By then, I was owed
quite a few favors,</font>

555
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:30,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh, Louisiana was
what they had.</font>

556
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, for a long time after,
I... I didn't really sleep.</font>

557
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:41,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nightmares, PTSD:</font>

558
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">exhausted nerves, whatever.</font>

559
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

560
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why homicide?</font>

561
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:27,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, something
I saw at Northshore.</font>

562
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:31,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quote from Corinthians.</font>

563
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:38,980

one member, but many."</font>

564
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:46,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Now are they many,
but... of one body."</font>

565
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:49,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that mean, though?</font>

566
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:53,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now. Heh!</font>

567
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fishing
pole's not working.</font>

568
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ask Grandpa.
No.</font>

569
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Grandpa, I can't tell
if it's working.</font>

570
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll know, honey.
It'll yank at you hard.</font>

571
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:07,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.
Why don't you...</font>

572
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:11,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that case going?
The big one?</font>

573
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Working it, you know.</font>

574
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:20,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things like that didn't
happen these parts
when I was young.</font>

575
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">People said "ma'am"
and "sir."</font>

576
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Families stayed together.</font>

577
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:28,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's how
it was, huh?</font>

578
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:31,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all the time.</font>

579
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was more dignity.</font>

580
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:37,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone wasn't out
in the street, yelling
about their rights.</font>

581
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:41,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if things were so great,</font>

582
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">they never would have changed.</font>

583
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:44,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

584
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing is going on.</font>

585
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying,
if there's a problem,</font>

586
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can talk to me.
You know that.</font>

587
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I have a problem
with someone, I talk
to them, Ma.</font>

588
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:53,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you should be able
to talk to me.</font>

589
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what it's like
to be married to a man.</font>

590
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think they're all
the same, huh?</font>

591
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:01,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why you're
so rude to me.</font>

592
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're frustrated,
don't take it out on me.</font>

593
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that you need
to get your cable fixed</font>

594
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.</font>

595
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:11,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you beat up on
what you can't control.</font>

596
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes it bad for everybody else.</font>

597
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:17,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how.
I don't care.
Just try.</font>

598
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do it.
I can't.</font>

599
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:21,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have smaller fingers.</font>

600
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Macie, just do it.</font>

601
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:27,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're telling me
the world isn't
getting worse?</font>

602
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seen kids today, all in black,</font>

603
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">wearing makeup,
shit on their faces.</font>

604
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:35,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's sex.</font>

605
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:37,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clinton.</font>

606
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, throughout history,</font>

607
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:44,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet every old man
probably said
the same thing.</font>

608
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">And old men die,</font>

609
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the world keeps spinning.</font>

610
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:52,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are the girls?
I got this lead...</font>

611
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this lead
I wanted to check up on.</font>

612
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you about it.</font>

613
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe your dad
could bring you back.
No.</font>

614
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell me
anything about it.</font>

615
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:04,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a family day.</font>

616
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did tell you about it.</font>

617
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mentioned it.
It's the new case.</font>

618
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:17,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, well, how about we
all head back, then?</font>

619
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:20,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. All right,
sweetheart.</font>

620
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Let's go!</font>

621
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:23,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">My line's tangled.</font>

622
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just paddle in.</font>

623
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Told you!</font>

624
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:30,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for
the lovely afternoon.</font>

625
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

626
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

627
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:01,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Afternoon, sir.</font>

628
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing
today, officer?
I have a question for you.</font>

629
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever seen this girl?</font>

630
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never seen her before?</font>

631
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never before.
Hm-mmm, not here.</font>

632
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Question.</font>

633
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:41,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking
for this young lady.
You recognize her?</font>

634
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:44,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might need a memory jog.</font>

635
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:46,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora.
Young blonde?</font>

636
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora. Dora, Dora,
Dora, Dora.</font>

637
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:50,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dora.</font>

638
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have any guys come
around lately,</font>

639
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:54,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking for anything
more than a good time?</font>

640
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be able
to remember for
a little more money?</font>

641
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might.</font>

642
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:01,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might?</font>

643
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:11,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Years we've been through this.</font>

644
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:13,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart, listen to me.</font>

645
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:16,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is nowhere else
I want to be.</font>

646
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if you even
know you're lying.</font>

647
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:21,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on!</font>

648
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:23,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

649
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad enough,</font>

650
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:28,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">the shit I got to wade
through on a daily basis,</font>

651
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">bring me this
"feel bad for me" crap</font>

652
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:34,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I work 30 hours
straight and spent
the weekend</font>

653
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">listening to
your dad's bullshit?</font>

654
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come home, the one place</font>

655
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">where there's supposed
to be peace and calm,</font>

656
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:44,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you throw this shit...
Who told you that?</font>

657
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.</font>

658
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supposed to be
what I want, it's
supposed to help me.</font>

659
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do help you!</font>

660
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the goddamn time!</font>

661
00:43:57,766 --> 00:44:00,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, well, what do you
want me to say?</font>

662
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to talk about
the woman, had antlers?</font>

663
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:07,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,</font>

664
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:12,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maybe you'll stop
with the "poor me"
little whiny bullshit?</font>

665
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you're saying, hmm?</font>

666
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I'm trying to make
you feel bad for me?</font>

667
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really how you
want to play this?</font>

668
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, honey.</font>

669
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're
the greatest woman
I ever met,</font>

670
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:30,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're the
greatest thing that
ever happened to me.</font>

671
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, yeah, you know, sometimes</font>

672
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you might
have a penchant</font>

673
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:38,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">for self-pity.</font>

674
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">And right now,
I need you to be strong</font>

675
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:44,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that I can do my job.</font>

676
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:49,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have developed
some sort of
selective deafness.</font>

677
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:54,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used to not be such
a chicken shit, I swear.</font>

678
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even your mom thinks
you're a ball-buster.</font>

679
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the girls dinner.</font>

680
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:20,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

681
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:27,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.</font>

682
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:31,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours just died in an accident.</font>

683
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:32,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

684
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:35,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a car accident.
Someone...</font>

685
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:38,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dinnertime, kids.
Go to the kitchen.</font>

686
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming?</font>

687
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:42,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course.
I'm starving.</font>

688
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:43,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

689
00:45:43,806 --> 00:45:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, really.
- Good.</font>

690
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:05,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how I think
about my daughter now?</font>

691
00:46:05,994 --> 00:46:08,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what...</font>

692
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:12,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">what she was spared?</font>

693
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:18,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I feel grateful.</font>

694
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:24,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctors said</font>

695
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">she didn't feel a thing.</font>

696
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Went straight into a coma,</font>

697
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then, somewhere in that...</font>

698
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:37,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">blackness, she slipped off
into another,</font>

699
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:40,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">deeper kind.</font>

700
00:46:43,865 --> 00:46:48,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that a beautiful way
to go out? Heh!</font>

701
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:52,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Painlessly,</font>

702
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:56,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a happy child.</font>

703
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:59,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

704
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, trouble with...</font>

705
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:06,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">dying later is you've
already grown up.</font>

706
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:10,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh! Damage is done.
It's too late.</font>

707
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got kids?</font>

708
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:16,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

709
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:21,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you got the hubris</font>

710
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">it must take to...</font>

711
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">yank a soul out of nonexistence</font>

712
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:31,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">into this meat.</font>

713
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:37,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to force a life
into this thresher.</font>

714
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:44,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as for my daughter,
she, uh...</font>

715
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">she spared me the sin</font>

716
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">of being a father.</font>

717
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Cathleen,</font>

718
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:53,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">you little vixen.</font>

719
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:57,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance
of some coffee?</font>

720
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
OK.</font>

721
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these guys?</font>

722
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:04,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some assholes
Quesada brought in.
Coffee on its way.</font>

723
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, morning, Marty.
Hey.</font>

724
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major's
introducing me.
New flying squad.</font>

725
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:12,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
Mark Daughtry,
Ted Bertrand.</font>

726
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daughtry.</font>

727
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ted.</font>

728
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy Dufrene.</font>

729
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:18,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?</font>

730
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:22,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been tasked
with investigating crimes
with possible occult links.</font>

731
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:25,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been a rash
of animal mutilations,</font>

732
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">cemeteries defiled.</font>

733
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:29,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they want
to see what we have
on the Lange case.
Uh-huh.</font>

734
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this task force is
important to the commander</font>

735
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to the governor's office.</font>

736
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.</font>

737
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, me, I don't
see the connection</font>

738
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:41,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.</font>

739
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then, I'm from Texas.</font>

740
00:48:44,653 --> 00:48:45,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh!</font>

741
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:47,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not stepping
on your toes, Marty.</font>

742
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just got the mandate.
We got to compare notes
with what you got.</font>

743
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

744
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you are,
Detective.
No. Oh.</font>

745
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:55,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Cathleen.
You got it.</font>

746
00:48:55,197 --> 00:48:57,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xerox all you want.</font>

747
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make you feel like good cops.</font>

748
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two, my office.</font>

749
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cohle, we got
a new rule around here,
especially for you.</font>

750
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:19,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got an opinion
about anything,</font>

751
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">you hold on to it.</font>

752
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:24,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hold on to it
or you tell it to Marty.</font>

753
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:26,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, button
your big, fat mouth.</font>

754
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:30,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">However smart you are,
you're not as smart
as you think.</font>

755
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:32,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be serious, boss.</font>

756
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">This God-bothering shit.</font>

757
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a political
circle-jerk.
You know this.</font>

758
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a place you live?</font>

759
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:41,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you, huh?</font>

760
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:45,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had anything
in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?</font>

761
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:46,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us some more guys</font>

762
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">to follow up KAs, track records.</font>

763
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:52,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, our bosses don't want you
at all, you understand?</font>

764
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:53,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you.</font>

765
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:58,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are upright only by
the grace of this man's
reputation.</font>

766
00:49:58,494 --> 00:49:59,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn, Cohle.</font>

767
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:04,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many ways
are there for me to say,
"Shut the fuck up"?</font>

768
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we work
under command, right?</font>

769
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, our betters want
a public, high-profile
show of response.</font>

770
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:14,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, I got a state senator,</font>

771
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's trying to label
Satanic graffiti
as a hate crime.</font>

772
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That has nothing to do
with our DB, and that's
the fact of it.</font>

773
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, OK. Fine.</font>

774
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:25,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say that's true,
all right?</font>

775
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:28,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say that you guys get
the case all to yourselves.</font>

776
00:50:28,123 --> 00:50:31,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever solve a murder, been in
the red more than a week?</font>

777
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever clear one where
two rounds of questions didn't
hand you the fucking answer?</font>

778
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:39,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on...
No, no, you got leads,
you got a timeline.</font>

779
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I got?
I got a whodunit</font>

780
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">where my two detectives
are stalling,</font>

781
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:47,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got a brand-new
task force wants to
take it off our hands.</font>

782
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:47,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a lead...</font>

783
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck off, Cohle.</font>

784
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ.</font>

785
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:58,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your call.</font>

786
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:01,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to dump this one off?</font>

787
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'd think about it,
given the spotlight.</font>

788
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:08,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Teddy Bertrand's
a good detective.
You know him.</font>

789
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:14,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're a smart-ass
with your mouth shut.</font>

790
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just gonna say</font>

791
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:17,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've got a lead on a church.</font>

792
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:19,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our vic was spending
a lot of time there.</font>

793
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.</font>

794
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:25,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside, whatever they're
putting over you,</font>

795
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:28,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much more time
could you get us?</font>

796
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, it's up
for discussion, but,</font>

797
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, Tuttle's lighting
a fire under this.</font>

798
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:35,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without a suspect,
they're just gonna</font>

799
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:39,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">stop asking questions, Marty,
and they're gonna give orders.</font>

800
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:40,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's that.</font>

801
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us the rest of the month</font>

802
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they lump it
into whatever</font>

803
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:49,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">the play is with
the task force, yeah?</font>

804
00:51:51,106 --> 00:51:52,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try.</font>

805
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:56,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two weeks, and then you two
start catching again.</font>

806
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

807
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's cut to the point.</font>

808
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the crow flies,
y'all are wanting to ask</font>

809
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:08,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">about that big throwdown
in the woods, yeah?</font>

810
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, sure.</font>

811
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now,
we're just trying
to track the case.</font>

812
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">How Cohle worked it, especially.</font>

813
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:20,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which indicates you think
I'm too thick to realize</font>

814
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:23,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">that y'all are trying
to jam somebody up.</font>

815
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:27,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on to something new.</font>

816
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:32,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Cohle
didn't want to give it
to the task force.</font>

817
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you?</font>

818
00:52:38,152 --> 00:52:41,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I did not.</font>

819
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:55,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.</font>

820
00:52:55,704 --> 00:53:01,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to this map,
it should be within
these few miles.</font>

821
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:06,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... ahem... I guess
if it's one of those</font>

822
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:10,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">tent revival places,
they move around.</font>

823
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

824
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tents usually do.</font>

825
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:20,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no date on this
flyer, which is strange.</font>

826
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something up there.</font>

827
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, back up.</font>

828
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:20,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying you were
hallucinating on the job?</font>

829
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:20,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

830
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I mean, I could
always tell what was real</font>

831
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">or what wasn't, you know.</font>

832
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when I'd see things,
like, man, I'd just...
roll with it.</font>

833
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still see things?</font>

834
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

835
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they stopped altogether</font>

836
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I was clean
a couple years.</font>

837
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">No numbers
on this place.</font>

838
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:49,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire must have happened
a long time ago.</font>

839
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.
Place is trashed.</font>

840
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ain't no kinda anything.</font>

841
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:36,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, back then, the visions.</font>

842
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:42,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced
that I'd lost it.</font>

843
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty?</font>

844
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there were other times...</font>

845
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth
of the universe.</font>
