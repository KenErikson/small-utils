Audrey's dad's
a cop. I, uh...</font>

00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean no disrespect.</font>

00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:59,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir, we didn't mean
any disrespect.</font>

You know that, right?</font>

00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.</font>

15
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that you're
a little angry right now.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You telling me how I feel?</font>

17
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,902

That's a cop's

<font color="#FFFFFF">Word of honor.</font>

90
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to know
about Rustin Cohle
in 2002.</font>

91
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why he took off,
what he'd done
since.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you had any contact
with Cohle, Mrs. Sawyer,
since 2002?</font>

93
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I haven't.
But you knew him
well enough.</font>

94
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he was your
husband's partner.</font>

95
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust?
Yeah, I knew him.</font>

96
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as well as other people.</font>

97
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, exactly, are you
asking about him?</font>

98
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something bad happened.</font>

99
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Cohle's involved.</font>

100
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">More we look at him,
it don't look good.</font>

101
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something went
real wrong with him
a long time ago.</font>

102
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew Rust to be a good man,</font>

103
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can't imagine
what I can offer.</font>

104
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Rust knew
exactly who he was...</font>

105
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there was
no talking him out of it.</font>

106
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Marty's
single big problem was</font>

107
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he never really
knew himself,</font>

108
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:52,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he never really knew
what to want.</font>

109
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:57,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm big enough to not stay
angry at someone for that...</font>

110
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:01,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">not after all this time.</font>

111
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Receipt in the bag?</font>

112
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.
Thank you so much.</font>

113
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:26,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have a good day.
- Thank you.</font>

114
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you
with anything, sir?</font>

115
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, uh, please.</font>

116
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking about this one.</font>

117
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:07,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

118
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:23,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Can I get
a dirty martini, please?</font>

119
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming right up.
Thanks.</font>

120
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big weekend planned?</font>

121
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah.</font>

122
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, heh! Yeah.</font>

123
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:44,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has all the makings
of a good time.</font>

124
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a cop, aren't you?</font>

125
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you know?</font>

126
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh,</font>

127
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I saw you
before, years back.</font>

128
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get in some trouble?</font>

129
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Uh...</font>

130
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">you came
around this place
I was staying,</font>

131
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,261

<font color="#FFFFFF">You always hit
the bottle this early

137
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

138
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't remember me?</font>

139
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

140
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:55,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to see you at
your revival tent,
January of '95.</font>

141
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you gave that up.</font>

142
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mid-eighties.
You were still with
the Tuttle ministry then.</font>

143
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:04,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know about
a Tuttle organization
that was set up</font>

144
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">to finance rural schools?</font>

145
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:13,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was called Wellspring.</font>

146
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an evangelical
initiative to provide
religious education</font>

147
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an alternative
to public school in
the rural communities.</font>

148
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, part of the reason
there was so many
dropouts in the state,</font>

149
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:29,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lot of kids had
to bus an hour or more.</font>

150
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know about that school
on Pelican Island?</font>

151
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know it specific,</font>

152
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there was one...</font>

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">in 1988.</font>

154
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accusations
of children being
interfered with.</font>

155
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never found anything on that.</font>

156
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was... it was kept
internal, I think.</font>

157
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was nothing,
maybe people was paid.</font>

158
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got nothing
to do with me, mind you.</font>

159
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to school
in Baton Rouge.</font>

160
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gossip around the seminary,</font>

161
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we didn't give
credence to rumors.</font>

162
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you leave?</font>

163
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bureaucracy.</font>

164
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Politics.</font>

165
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't lie to me.</font>

166
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you leave?</font>

167
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:42,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Part of our lay duties
was custodial.</font>

168
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">One night, cleaned
the senior minister's
library.</font>

169
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knocked over</font>

170
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">a very old volume,</font>

171
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Letters
of Telios DeLorca."</font>

172
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelfth-century
Franciscan mystic,
very obscure.</font>

173
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:09,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I picked up
the book, this little
folder falls out.</font>

174
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little folder of pictures.</font>

175
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:19,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pictures of children.</font>

176
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naked.</font>

177
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looked like they was sleeping.</font>

178
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what'd you do?</font>

179
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it over to
the morals officer,
Deacon Farrar.</font>

180
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was close to Tuttle,</font>

181
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">vice president of the college.</font>

182
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't do nothin'?</font>

183
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:44,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he seemed...
he got angry that
I brought it to him.</font>

184
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">He even intimated
that maybe I was
confessing to something.</font>

185
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I had to prove
to him that I wasn't.</font>

186
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:58,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">He promised to look into it...</font>

187
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:03,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd left by the time
Wellspring shut down.</font>

188
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:10,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you quit the revival, hmm?</font>

189
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:15,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, our last two tents
was vandalized.</font>

190
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost heart.</font>

191
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little too much of this.</font>

192
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:30,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my life, I wanted
to be nearer to God.</font>

193
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:35,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the only nearness...</font>

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">silence.</font>

195
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it wasn't
as bad as it seemed.</font>

196
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than most.</font>

197
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jan was a decent lady.</font>

198
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard she sold
the ranch a while back.</font>

199
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe that was you.</font>

200
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saved up money for a place,</font>

201
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:55,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">got a straight job.</font>

202
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd run off
from a bad situation
when we first met.</font>

203
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just...
Just so great</font>

204
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">how you turned
everything around.</font>

205
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.</font>

206
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:11,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you were
a big hero in the papers.</font>

207
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, they made a bigger deal</font>

208
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">of that than it was.</font>

209
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't been...</font>

210
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">too heroic of late.</font>

211
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:24,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just...</font>

212
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good man.</font>

213
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody can see that.</font>

214
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:33,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it
the first time
I met you.</font>

215
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">God gave us these flaws,</font>

216
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and something I learned...</font>

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't see them as flaws.</font>

218
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:47,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is nothing wrong
with the way He made us.</font>

219
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:51,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">The universe forgives all.</font>

220
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want some bourbon?</font>

221
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

222
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

223
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

224
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened in 2002?</font>

225
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:57,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... you pulled
our last case?</font>

226
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charmaine Boudreaux?</font>

227
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was in all the papers.</font>

228
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:05,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Marshland Medea."
You know who Medea was?</font>

229
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
We had a lot of static</font>

230
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">after that, me and him.</font>

231
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a bad one.</font>

232
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always thought it contributed,</font>

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust's state of mind
when he walked.</font>

234
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">SIDs.</font>

235
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

236
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a 4-letter word,
S-I-D-S,</font>

237
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, I mean...</font>

238
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is it?</font>

239
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an old word,</font>

240
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a curse.</font>

241
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a language anyone speaks.</font>

242
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's what happened
to Jessica,</font>

243
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">your first.</font>

244
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said... your second,</font>

245
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jody, was 23 days old.</font>

246
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">The autopsy showed
no signs of trauma,
so...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">SIDs.</font>

248
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:10,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost one myself, Charmaine.</font>

249
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost a marriage, too.</font>

250
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now your third,</font>

251
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you had him last year.</font>

252
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, lady, you ever hear
of a fuckin' condom?</font>

253
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Birth control's a sin.</font>

254
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">A child is a wonderful thing.</font>

255
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">A child is wonderful.</font>

256
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:04,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, sometimes people...</font>

257
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">mistake a child as an answer</font>

258
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">for something,</font>

259
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:13,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, like a way
to change their story.</font>

260
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:19,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charmaine,
have you ever heard
of something called...</font>

261
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Munchausen by Proxy?</font>

262
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:27,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

263
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">At exactly 4:49 a.m.,</font>

264
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sleep apnea monitor
that was hooked up
to your child</font>

265
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">was unplugged...</font>

266
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">for 36 minutes.</font>

267
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it was
plugged back in,
and by that time,</font>

268
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:50,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">the child's vitals
had flat-lined.</font>

269
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charmaine, I need you</font>

270
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">to talk to me about some things.</font>

271
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK?</font>

272
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

273
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it going?</font>

00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's getting it.</font>

275
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should sign that.</font>

276
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The newspapers</font>

277
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:31,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">are gonna be tough on you...</font>

278
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">and prison is
very... very hard</font>

279
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,029

280
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get the opportunity,
you should kill yourself.</font>

281
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

282
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:56,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Please.</font>

283
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just... wait.</font>

284
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

285
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">This evil bitch.</font>

00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I called
Pennsylvania, tried

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,
it's still life.
Yeah.</font>

290
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job.</font>

291
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Marty,</font>

292
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">type that up for me, will ya?</font>

293
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?
You got somewhere to be?</font>

294
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:36,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">This confession is,
like, 40 pages.</font>

295
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, and you got
somewhere to be?
Come on, man.</font>

296
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me
to tie your shoes
for you, too?</font>

297
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:47,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

298
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:47,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

299
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we actually
need your signature</font>

300
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the third page,
if you have it.</font>

301
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuck's with
the attitude, huh?</font>

302
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like my time's less than yours?</font>

303
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you got things to do, Marty?</font>

304
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:03,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to go home
to the family,
play with the kids?</font>

305
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,614

Think about it.</font>

398
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:23,732

started on the case,
he took it over.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

402
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause he recognized

You know why?</font>

406
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we don't see 'em.</font>

00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't you
get that bathroom
cleaned</font>

456
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">finally, huh, get all
the toothpaste up?</font>

457
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

458
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, I didn't know
you were home.</font>

459
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, I'm just cleaning up.</font>

460
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:14,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be out in a sec.</font>

461
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:19,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll heat up something.</font>

462
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, those flowers came in nice.</font>

463
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:26,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.
They really
brighten up the yard.</font>

464
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey,</font>

465
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:34,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking
we're due for
a date night,</font>

466
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:39,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you think, you and me?</font>

467
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to dress up and go</font>

468
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a nice dinner,</font>

469
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">the movies.</font>

470
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Does that
sound good?</font>

471
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey?</font>

472
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

473
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

474
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Thanks, hon.</font>

475
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

476
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:28,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, is my eldest still
offended by my presence?</font>

477
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

478
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mind.</font>

479
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happy just to sit here with
3 beautiful women watching...</font>

480
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

481
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:44,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dumb Blondes
in Cracker Country"?</font>

482
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:57,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hon?</font>

483
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do me a favor, find the game?</font>

484
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

485
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:06,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to study.</font>

486
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:09,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good girl.</font>

487
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rolls right onto
victory lane into Daytona U.S.A.</font>

488
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:20,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Davis with the steal.
Pops it in to Hudson.</font>

489
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hudson trying to move
the ball down the court,
and a foul on Flowers.</font>

490
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

491
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

492
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this pasta is great.</font>

493
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

494
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

495
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:46,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

496
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:49,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

497
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:55,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You turn it down some, please?</font>

498
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, hon.</font>

499
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

500
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

501
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:08,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were talking once</font>

502
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">about growing up parents.</font>

503
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:13,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said something about
forgiveness, and he said</font>

504
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">that there was no such thing
as forgiveness...</font>

505
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">that people just have
short memories.</font>

506
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think Cohle was
wrong about that?</font>

507
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgiveness?</font>

508
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:28,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less and less.</font>

509
00:35:46,842 --> 00:35:49,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

510
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get you a drink, Miss?</font>

511
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Uh, sure.</font>

512
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:03,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">A vodka martini, extra dirty.</font>

513
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:05,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaret.</font>

514
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce. Hi.</font>

515
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

516
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you, uh, waiting for someone?</font>

517
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

518
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:24,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and, uh,
Marty split prior, right?</font>

519
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">In '95?</font>

520
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are either of you married?</font>

521
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Got an ex.
- Mmm.</font>

522
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still on the first.</font>

523
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's difficult to admit defeat.</font>

524
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:41,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty quit drinking,</font>

525
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">found religion for a while.</font>

526
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't love that.</font>

527
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:48,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest,
I preferred him before;</font>

528
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had a sense of humor then.</font>

529
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:54,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we stayed
together 7 more years,
some of it pretty good.</font>

530
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">2002?</font>

531
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cohle's bad year, too.</font>

532
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:02,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust was an intense man,
but he had integrity.</font>

533
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was responsible.</font>

534
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:09,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a lot of responsible
people in the world.</font>

535
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:17,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reverend, thanks for taking</font>

536
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">the time to see me
on such short notice.</font>

537
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Detective, please.</font>

538
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a very
interesting... building.</font>

539
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was the first.
Built it in 1980.</font>

540
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:31,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of the campus
grew around it.</font>

541
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I remembered
you, of course.</font>

542
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:37,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of this state
owe you a great deal.</font>

543
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as much as they owe you.</font>

544
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charitable organizations,</font>

545
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">education initiatives.</font>

546
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
We're very proud
of our ministries.</font>

547
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't do
as much preaching
as I used to,</font>

548
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the legacy program
is more my focus now,</font>

549
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">the things like
the State Policemen's
Charity... but...</font>

550
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">what did you want
to talk about, son?</font>

551
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Wellspring program,</font>

552
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">mid-eighties through
the early nineties.</font>

553
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:06,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember that?</font>

554
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, of course
I remember, yeah.</font>

555
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to locate
old personnel,</font>

556
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">faculty, but I'm having
a little bit of trouble
acquiring names.</font>

557
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:19,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the program was
shut down officially,
you know, maybe 10 years ago.</font>

558
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never had much ground
contact with it,</font>

559
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it involved a number
of private schools...</font>

560
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enterprises, you understand...</font>

561
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:29,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would adopt our
standard of curriculum
and, in return,</font>

562
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">receive tuition reimbursement</font>

563
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">for underprivileged students.</font>

564
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got any files,</font>

565
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">any list of faculty?</font>

566
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:40,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's what I'm
getting at, is that these
were private institutions,</font>

567
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you'd have to track
down their administrators,
I believe.</font>

568
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the thing.</font>

569
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, all the
schools dissolved
with the program,</font>

570
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm trying
to find some tax info,</font>

571
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there were
religious exemptions.</font>

572
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's our
archives, of course.</font>

573
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we did lose a lot of files,</font>

574
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">had some flooding of one
of the sub-floors.</font>

575
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you know, I think
I should put you
together with one</font>

576
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">of our clerical workers
and see if they can't
help you find something.</font>

577
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:11,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Listen,
before you do that...</font>

578
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:16,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">former deacon of yours,
Austin Farrar.</font>

579
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:22,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was very, very unfortunate.</font>

580
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet he was dismissed.</font>

581
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evidence had accrued.</font>

582
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">It became apparent
that Austin had</font>

583
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">implemented
certain... funds.</font>

584
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, "embezzling" is the word.</font>

585
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">We elected to handle it
internally,</font>

586
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">rather than pursuing
formal charges.</font>

587
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:44,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he had
his... accident.</font>

588
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd heard he had taken it hard,</font>

589
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:50,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">drinking.</font>

590
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:55,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen more souls
lost down a bottle
than any pit.</font>

591
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the same time,</font>

592
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's hard to trust a man
who can't trust himself</font>

593
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a beer, don't you think?</font>

594
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

595
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what's this
all about now? Um...</font>

596
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wellspring program,</font>

597
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Austin Farrar?</font>

598
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:15,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead women and children.</font>

599
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible.</font>

600
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's terrible.</font>

601
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:24,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that what
you're working on?</font>

602
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:30,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can't say
anything about it
at this point, Reverend.</font>

603
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:35,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to set you up
with a clerk.</font>

604
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can look at, uh,</font>

605
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:44,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever information
we still have</font>

606
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Wellspring.</font>

607
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:53,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd the Wellspring program
shut down, Reverend?</font>

608
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">It couldn't sustain its costs.</font>

609
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole idea
was to provide
an alternative</font>

610
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:02,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the kind of secular,
globalized education</font>

611
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">that our public schools
were promoting.</font>

612
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:07,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we get
the school voucher
program instituted,</font>

613
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll reintroduce the idea.</font>

614
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:14,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">People should have
a choice in education,
like anything else.</font>

615
00:41:14,637 --> 00:41:15,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

616
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, would you show
the detective</font>

617
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">to our old archives
for outside ministries?</font>

618
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.
I'll call ahead.</font>

619
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna come back for that.</font>

620
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:28,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reverend, thank you
for your time today.</font>

621
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:32,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godspeed, Detective.</font>

622
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be in my thoughts.</font>

623
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just the one more time.</font>

624
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need it... I just
need it one more time.</font>

625
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beth, if you knew
the day I just had...</font>

626
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:54,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, then tell me about it.
I want to hear about it.</font>

627
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

628
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">no, you do not.</font>

629
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:03,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really wanted to see you.</font>

630
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:06,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking
about something all week.</font>

631
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:09,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't.
Ever since last time.</font>

632
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't, OK?
I just...</font>

633
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:15,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't been able to
think of anything else,
tell you the truth.</font>

634
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh...</font>

635
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">like what?</font>

636
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:23,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking.</font>

637
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:27,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think...</font>

638
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to fuck me in my ass.</font>

639
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:33,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Beth.</font>

640
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:35,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never done that before, but</font>

641
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I want you
to do it to me.</font>

642
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to feel better.</font>

643
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:44,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You out
of your goddamn mind, hmm?</font>

644
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd I tell you?</font>

645
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fuckin'
unbelievable, boy.</font>

646
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:50,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know about this?</font>

647
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'm not sure
what we're talking
about here.</font>

648
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your partner here,
he braced Billy Lee Tuttle.</font>

649
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, "braced"?
Are you fucking
kidding me?</font>

650
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a friendly conversation.</font>

651
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dipshit,</font>

652
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">you don't get
to decide what kind of
conversation it was.</font>

653
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you talk
to Billy Lee Tut...</font>

654
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:08,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you,
look at... you look
like you haven't seen</font>

655
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">your own bed
in a couple days, huh?</font>

656
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:12,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? The fuck is wrong
with you two?</font>

657
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.
Well, I... I can't
speak for Rust,</font>

658
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I got the flu.</font>

659
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know
that was going around.</font>

660
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.</font>

661
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he was pissed off after
the conversation we had,</font>

662
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I am on
to fucking something.</font>

663
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the fuck up.
I told you.</font>

664
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fuckin' told you!</font>

665
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">And human tampon here heard me.</font>

666
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:32,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Badge and gun, Cohle.
You're suspended.</font>

00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:39,914

672
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you fuckin' Leroy me!
I told you both!</font>

673
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the shit!
It's done.</font>

674
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Badge and gun, Cohle.</font>

675
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, uh, before
your official reinstatement,</font>

676
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have 30 hours mandated
departmental counseling.</font>

677

<font color="#FFFFFF">You fuckin' serious?</font>

678
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy, right?</font>

679
00:43:58,635 --> 00:43:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to kick you
in the fuckin' head.</font>

680
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the person least
in need of counseling</font>

you don't sound right.</font>

683
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're up my ass,
and you were warned.</font>

684
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:49,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

685
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's doing it again.</font>

686
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:55,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been doing it.</font>

687
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't live with it.</font>

688
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't live with it.</font>

689
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:14,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't deal with it,</font>

690
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">not again.</font>

691
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know?</font>

692
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know?</font>

693
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

694
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:50,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing in here?</font>

695
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:52,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

696
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:55,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm off the job.</font>

697
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:03,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what I mean.</font>

698
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't live like this.</font>

699
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, people
that give me advice,</font>

700
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:19,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reckon they're talking
to themselves.</font>

701
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

702
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:25,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people, no matter
where they look,
they see themselves.</font>

703
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:40,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be honest...</font>

704
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:42,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">with me now.</font>

705
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,452

doing here?</font>

706
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:13,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

707
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:16,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Really. I...</font>

711
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't even sure
I could do it.</font>

712
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:30,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seventeen years is
a long time.
Huh?</font>

713
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

714
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:34,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost went with a...</font>

715
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:37,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a stranger, a bar.</font>

716
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Rust.</font>

717
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:43,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll have to go,
you see, because this</font>

00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">he won't live with.</font>

719
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck out of here.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the fuck...</font>

722
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:51,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will hurt him.</font>

723
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck out
of here right now.</font>

724
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but thank you.</font>

725
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:57,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the fuck out of here.</font>

726
00:48:57,967 --> 00:49:02,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm...
Get the fuck
out of here!</font>

727
00:49:09,277 --> 00:49:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what
was going on with Cohle
around that time?</font>

728
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:17,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

729
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew that he got suspended</font>

730
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:22,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that he quit</font>

731
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">after he and Marty had his...</font>

732
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:27,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">they had their thing.</font>

00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

734
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So your split with Marty...</font>

735
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:35,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">that had nothing
to do with Cohle?</font>

739
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing?</font>

740
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:17,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

741
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

742
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to tell you something.</font>

743
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:33,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the pictures
on your phone.</font>

744

00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:38,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, honey...
Nice ass, Marty.</font>

746
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I...
I was maybe
always a little</font>

747
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">too skinny for you.
No.</font>

crazy bitch sent...</font>

749
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I slept with someone.</font>

750
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:56,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know him.</font>

00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're close.</font>

752
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

753
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Rust.</font>

754
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:10,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fucked your partner Rust.</font>

755
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

756
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what... what
are you saying?</font>

757
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... what are you...
what the fuck are you
saying to me?</font>

758
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,344

803
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,471

821
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:06,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was
old stuff between them...</font>

822
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:10,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way they
always rubbed wrong.</font>

823
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:14,474

824
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:10,097

830
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

831
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,782
