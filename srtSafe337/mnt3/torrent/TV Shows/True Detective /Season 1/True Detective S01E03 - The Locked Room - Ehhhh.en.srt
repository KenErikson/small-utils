00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">but He saw you.</font>

3
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:26,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saw you
in those dark corners.</font>

00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:31,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my brothers,
He heard those thoughts.</font>

6
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:33,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!
Preach it.</font>

7
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen!
Yes!</font>

8
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Glory.</font>

00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are stranger to yourself,

<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.
Yes. He does, sir.</font>

11
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:45,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when your heart hardened,
made you liken to the stone,</font>

12
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,566

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
Yeah!</font>

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew you.
That is forever.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It is merely the limitation

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well,
if the common good</font>

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">has got to make up fairy tales,</font>

can you imagine</font>

61
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,425

<font color="#FFFFFF">then, brother, that person</font>

66

it's all a scam, huh,</font>

81

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

85
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been that way since one
monkey looked at the sun</font>

86
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:57,088

<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen!
Amen.</font>

97

00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,240

147
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,886

00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

154
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Great preaching.</font>

155
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long you been doing this?</font>

156
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been preaching almost 20 years.</font>

157
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had Friends of Christ
for the last 8.</font>

158
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You with a church before that?</font>

159
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Independent evangelical.</font>

160
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came up under
Billy Lee Tuttle,</font>

161
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">went to his college in
Baton Rouge a couple years.</font>

162
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">So back in Eunice,</font>

163
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">who painted the mural
on the church wall?</font>

164
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children from our
congregation painted it.</font>

165
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

166
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something happen to this girl?</font>

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">You looking for her?</font>

168
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Theriot, can we see
the identification</font>

169
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your staff members?</font>

170
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever see her
with anybody?</font>

171
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't she with
someone the one day?</font>

172
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:42,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember?
The tall man.</font>

173
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
but I don't know</font>

174
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:46,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she was "with him" with him.</font>

175
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can you describe him?</font>

176
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just saw them talking.</font>

177
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:55,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't get close or anything.</font>

178
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:59,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was hunched forward
talking to her,</font>

179
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">kind of a strange face, I think,</font>

180
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">skin shiny around his jaw.</font>

181
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, what, like burned?</font>

182
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

183
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did she leave with him?</font>

184
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe like that.</font>

185
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrested 10/89 on a 314,</font>

186
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">spent last year in solitary
after a gang altercation.</font>

187
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Print and hold.
Thank you.</font>

188
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.</font>

189
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything check out?</font>

190
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the most part.</font>

191
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:55,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burt, you spent two
years in Angola...</font>

192
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indecency, public exposure,</font>

193
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">whacking off outside a school.</font>

194
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:06,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">They gave me bad medicine.
I didn't know.</font>

195
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid for that.
I paid for that.</font>

196
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you account
for his whereabouts</font>

197
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:17,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">December 25 through January 3?</font>

198
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Christmas
to New Year's,</font>

199
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">we was in New Roads.</font>

200
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't be a problem
to find people</font>

201
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">who'll vouch for
Burt's whereabouts.</font>

202
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a good turnout there.</font>

203
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good turnout in...</font>

204
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:31,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective, what is it
you think happened?</font>

205
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:34,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it...</font>

206
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">left a painting
of the crime scene</font>

207
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">on one of your old churches.</font>

210
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was she raped, detective?</font>

211
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you ask that?</font>

212
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:06,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you speak to Burt alone,</font>

213
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you'll be
adequately convinced</font>

214
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">of his innocence, detective.</font>

215
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Let's do that.</font>

216
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burt, go with the detective.</font>

217
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ontological fallacy
of expecting</font>

218
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:24,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">a light at the end
of the tunnel,</font>

219
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:28,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, that's what
the preacher sells,</font>

220
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">same as a shrink.</font>

221
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the preacher, he encourages</font>

222
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">your capacity for illusion.</font>

223
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he tells you
it's a fucking virtue.</font>

224
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always a buck to be had
doing that,</font>

225
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's such a desperate sense
of entitlement, isn't it?</font>

226
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Surely, this is all for me.</font>

227
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Me.</font>

228
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Me, me, me. I, I.</font>

229
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm so fucking important.</font>

230
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:03,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so fucking important,
then, right?" Fuck you.</font>

231
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse us
for a second.</font>

232
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know.</font>

233
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:24,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy. I am not
gonna hurt you.</font>

234
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna hurt you.</font>

235
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

236
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Compassion is ethics, detective.</font>

237
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. It is.</font>

238
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:44,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ran checks
on all of them.</font>

239
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone has got a clean
record except for Burt.</font>

240
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could see
this being some kind</font>

241
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">of retard job...</font>

242
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:55,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pays for it, gets ashamed,</font>

243
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">overreacts,</font>

244
00:13:57,302 --> 00:14:03,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">tries to redeem the act,
like, you know?</font>

245
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not bad, Marty...</font>

246
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah.</font>

247
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got all the way there
without your help.</font>

248
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not him.</font>

249
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did a deuce at the farm
for dick wagging.</font>

250
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should've been in
a mental ward to begin with.</font>

251
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the second half.</font>

252
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:20,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angola.</font>

253
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some Bloods caught him
in the shower,</font>

254
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">took his balls off with a razor.</font>

255
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were sloppy about it.</font>

256
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus.</font>

257
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still...</font>

258
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I braced him.</font>

259
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:39,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shit himself, literally.</font>

260
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can put some
troopers on this place,</font>

261
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">have them surveil it,</font>

262
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:49,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think we should move on,</font>

263
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">the tall man.</font>

264
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that could be bullshit.</font>

265
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">One threw it out,</font>

266
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the other one
picked up on it.</font>

267
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Burt knew.</font>

268
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saw the tall man, too.</font>

269
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This,</font>

270
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Marie Fontenot thing,</font>

271
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's no way Lange
was his first,</font>

272
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">no fucking way.</font>

273
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rosie, can you
help them get out, please.</font>

274
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't
matched any signatures.</font>

275
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">One guy in the fed
database used crowns,</font>

276
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">another a set of antlers...</font>

00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michigan lifer.</font>

278
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:41,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he called
the signature wrong.</font>

279
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know that
there's any connection</font>

280
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,411

281
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but the lattices,
the symbology...</font>

282
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some kind of culture
to it, Marty.</font>

283
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he wanted
us to find this one,</font>

284
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">like he was showing off.</font>

285
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:06,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">That cane field is our stage.</font>

286
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a suggestion, then.</font>

287
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">We start at zero,
they're gonna hand it</font>

288
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the task force.</font>

289
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, somebody missed something.</font>

290
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to go back,
check all files.</font>

291
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any DBs in state
the last 5 years,</font>

292
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">we start there.</font>

293
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have the hours.</font>

294
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, man. Look.</font>

295
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've noticed you have
a tendency toward myopia,</font>

296
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">tunnel vision,
blows investigations.</font>

298
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're obsessive.</font>

299
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:45,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're obsessive, too,
just not about the job.</font>

300
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not, me, brother.</font>

301
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep things even, separate,</font>

302
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the way I can
have this one beer</font>

303

<font color="#FFFFFF">without needing 20.</font>

304

306
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try not to be
too hard on myself.</font>

307
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's real big of you.</font>

308
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the real difference
between you and me?</font>

309
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Denial.</font>

310
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:17,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">The difference is
that I know the difference</font>

311
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">between an idea and a fact.</font>

312
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are incapable
of admitting doubt.</font>

313
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:27,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that sounds
like denial to me.</font>

314
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt that.</font>

315
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:35,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll put out an APB</font>

316
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">on any tall man
with facial scarring...</font>

317
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:39,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

318
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:43,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Telex the hospitals
for patients that fit.</font>

319
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

320
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:02,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Cohle was trying
to keep it from the task force.</font>

321
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:06,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking back,
you ever think maybe</font>

322
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">he tried to push things</font>

323
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">where he wanted them to go?</font>

324
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:15,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We went where
the case led us.</font>

325
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you took it up, though,</font>

326
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">his serial theory.</font>

327
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, as arrogant
as he could be,</font>

328
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was right.</font>

329
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:28,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's how
we got our man.</font>

330
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh,</font>

331
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I like it
this way, you know?</font>

332
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's steady.</font>

333
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit, really.</font>

334
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. I did all the
counseling and stuff.</font>

335
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just the way things are.</font>

336
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Things don't
stay the same.</font>

337
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick up what you keep, and
you leave the rest behind.</font>

338
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:46,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">People get better.</font>

339
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's the thing.
I think I am better.</font>

340
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think so?</font>

341
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, trust me.</font>

342
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you just think
you prefer it this way</font>

343
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's
what you're used to.</font>

344
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your life accommodates you.</font>

345
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:05,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to be
afraid of loss.</font>

346
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the guys
I was telling you about.</font>

347
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get a dog, fish,
what have you.</font>

348
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:14,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You start with that.
You live with it.</font>

349
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, I suppose
you could set me up</font>

350
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a nurse, get me
some of the good drugs.</font>

351
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:39,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

352
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">New start.</font>

353
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:45,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy.
Daddy.</font>

354
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, kids.</font>

355
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, honey.</font>

356
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, Marty?</font>

357
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, Rust?</font>

358
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brought the mower back.</font>

359
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mow my yard?</font>

360
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I saw
it needed mowing,</font>

361
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:06,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">returned the favor, borrowing.</font>

362
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got etouffee,</font>

363
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to get Rust
to stay for dinner.</font>

364
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?</font>

365
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay for dinner, Rust.</font>

366
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:20,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah. I think
I got to get.</font>

367
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie, thank you for the tea.</font>

368
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to hear that.</font>

369
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you Monday.</font>

370
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll walk you out.</font>

371
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

372
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

373
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

374
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:44,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell do you
think you're doing, man,</font>

375
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">at my house when I'm not here?</font>

376
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Returning the mower.</font>

377
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean.</font>

378
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mow my lawn? Hmm?</font>

379
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:57,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just what'd you think
I'd be doing over here</font>

380
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're not around, Marty?</font>

381
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:04,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's our problem, you and me?</font>

382
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.</font>

383
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't ever want you</font>

384
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">mowing my lawn, all right?</font>

385
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like mowing my lawn.</font>

386
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

387
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is your team, Daddy?</font>

388
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, baby. That...
I want them to win.</font>

389
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hey, Audrey, your mom and I</font>

390
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">want to talk to you
a minute about</font>

391
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">those drawings you
did in school, yeah?</font>

392
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mace, run to your room.</font>

393
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:14,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

394
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I said so.
Run to y...</font>

395
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Go on.</font>

396
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

397
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:28,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Run.</font>

398
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:35,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

399
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:38,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to get
upset, honey, OK?</font>

400
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just want to talk to you.</font>

401
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you see that
before, hmm?</font>

402
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you draw that?</font>

403
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because other girls liked it</font>

404
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they thought it was funny.</font>

405
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all.</font>

406
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:59,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but where'd you
get that idea, hmm?</font>

407
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls dared me to do it.</font>

408
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

409
00:23:05,683 --> 00:23:08,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">That upsets people, Audrey.</font>

410
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ugly.</font>

411
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes something
that should be nice</font>

412
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">ugly.</font>

413
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Oh...</font>

414
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh. That's OK.
It's OK.</font>

415
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's OK, sweetie.</font>

416
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm not saying
that I got any room to talk,</font>

417
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">but do you know what it means
to be a father?</font>

418
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means you are accountable
for other people.</font>

419
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are responsible
for their lives.</font>

420
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, past a certain point,</font>

421
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:50,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a futility
in responsibility.</font>

422
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

423
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the extent
of your concern?</font>

424
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:10,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no.</font>

425
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't know what
looking at it any more</font>

426
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">is gonna do.</font>

427
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's her.
I'm concerned.</font>

428
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:21,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she's just trying
to get attention,</font>

429
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the other girls...</font>

430
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, how do they even know
about that stuff yet?</font>

431
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:30,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls always know before boys.</font>

432
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that?</font>

433
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they have to.</font>

434
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.
She's withdrawn.</font>

435
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asks about you,
and she wants to know</font>

436
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you're working so much now.</font>

437
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I should be working less.</font>

438
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Task force is gonna
take that case,</font>

439
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll be around more.</font>

440
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last week?</font>

441
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about that.
I should've begged off.</font>

442
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were having a good night.</font>

443
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't stop me. Talk.</font>

444
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm close, Marty.</font>

445
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?
I'm close.</font>

446
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:18,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, they're gonna
pull that case from us,</font>

447
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll be around more,
and we'll do things.</font>

448
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:27,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is there all this
space between us, Marty?</font>

449
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you mean.</font>

450
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do know what I mean,</font>

451
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't say,
and that's it.</font>

452
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm talking about.</font>

453
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">This last year, you've
been a sulky teenager.</font>

454
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it.</font>

455
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:42,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to be
your friend, Marty.</font>

456
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:51,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just not good
at... expressing.</font>

457
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">We change, don't we,</font>

458
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sometimes not for long.</font>

459
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here I'm thinking people
don't really change at all,</font>

460
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">not who they are at heart.</font>

461
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to remember things
because I feel</font>

462
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I should, like it's my job</font>

463
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:11,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">or something,
you know, early days,</font>

464
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm tired of
trying to remember.</font>

465
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:18,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Part of this...
And I'm not talking</font>

466
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the part
that's all my fault...</font>

467
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:24,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">But part of it, it's just life.</font>

468
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">We used to spend weekends
without leaving my room.</font>

469
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what I mean.
Remember that?</font>

470
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course we don't
screw like we're 19.</font>

471
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:37,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, you want low expectations.</font>

472
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:39,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put a ceiling on your life,</font>

473
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">on everything, because
you won't change.</font>

474
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were so much smarter
when I met you,</font>

475
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know?</font>

476
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Maggie.</font>

477
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:01,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for everything...</font>

478
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">For not being here,</font>

479
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">for taking all this for granted.</font>

480
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:13,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you been doing, Marty?</font>

481
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:17,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

482
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:26,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work, home, cases.</font>

483
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:30,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just...</font>

484
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:34,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get to feeling like...</font>

485
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:38,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. I can see 40...</font>

486
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's like I'm that coyote</font>

487
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the cartoons,</font>

488
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I'm running off a cliff,</font>

489
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:54,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if I don't look down
and keep running,</font>

490
00:27:54,705 --> 00:28:00,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be fine, but, um...</font>

491
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:06,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm all fucked up.</font>

492
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:12,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

493
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You are.</font>

494
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty?</font>

495
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:38,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, well, we pulled
a few hospital patients...</font>

496
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:43,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tall, scarred, sex offenders.</font>

497
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">One kid did B&Es.</font>

498
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:50,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had to tug one out
before he could leave a scene.</font>

499
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:55,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phew. Yeah.
A lot of room work then.</font>

500
00:29:56,826 --> 00:30:00,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one of you guys
is the box man?</font>

501
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, yeah?</font>

502
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:08,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to be pretty good
in there myself,</font>

503
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">not as good as Rust.</font>

504
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, son.</font>

505
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can read this off you.</font>

506
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not bad.
It's not you.</font>

507
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a weight,</font>

508
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it got its fishhooks</font>

509
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your heart and your soul.</font>

510
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:42,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what you did
is not your fault.</font>

511
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not.</font>

512
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You was drug to the bottom</font>

513
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:49,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">by that same weight,
the same weight</font>

514
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">that won't let you
get along in a job,</font>

515
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">and same weight that
wouldn't let you</font>

516
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">get along at school...</font>

517
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">same weight that
wouldn't let you</font>

518
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">have a mom.</font>

519
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:10,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know these things, Chris.</font>

520
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:14,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm weak. I'm sick.</font>

521
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:18,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get into the houses,
and I can't leave</font>

522
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:22,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I go all over the drawers.</font>

523
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:25,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, son.</font>

524
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got one way out,</font>

525
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's through
the grace of God.</font>

526
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're only how
the Lord made you.</font>

527
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not flawed.</font>

528
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We, you, me, people,</font>

529
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:43,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">we don't choose our feelings.</font>

530
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's grace in this world,</font>

531
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's forgiveness for all,</font>

532
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you have to ask for it.</font>

533
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. I do.
I want that.</font>

534
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:59,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want it. I want that.
I'm asking. I'm asking.</font>

535
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me. Tell me.</font>

536
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please just tell me what to say.</font>

537
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:08,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to confess.
I want to confess.</font>

538
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:18,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that.</font>

539
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:24,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your assist record, man,
that's something else.</font>

540
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any pointers?</font>

541
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I never really
found it that hard.</font>

542
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:34,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just look at somebody
and think like they think,</font>

543
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">negative capability.</font>

544
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I guess it's a skill.</font>

545
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:43,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most times,
you don't even need that.</font>

546
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:48,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just look them in the eyes.
The whole story is right there.</font>

547
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:54,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody wears their hunger
and their haunt, you know?</font>

548
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just got to be honest
about what can go on up here,</font>

549
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">a locked room...</font>

550
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then again,
I'm terrible at cards.</font>

551
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:09,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha!</font>

552
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So while we were grilling
B&E jerkoffs and burn victims,</font>

553
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:17,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I decided to put insomnia
to good use.</font>

554
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">People.</font>

555
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen the finale
of thousands of lives, man...</font>

556
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young, old.</font>

557
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one is so sure
of their realness,</font>

558
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:03,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">that their sensory experience
constituted a unique individual</font>

559
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:08,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">with purpose, meaning...</font>

560
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:15,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">so certain that they were
more than a biological puppet.</font>

561
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:21,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the truth wills out,
and everybody sees</font>

562
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:26,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">once the strings are cut,
all fall down.</font>

563
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie says he's shy.</font>

564
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't say that.</font>

565
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely not shy
about speaking his mind.</font>

566
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not what I mean.</font>

567
00:34:57,327 --> 00:35:00,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">His personality.
He's edgy.</font>

568
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:05,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, intense,
more like, introverted.</font>

569
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:07,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want
another drunk.</font>

570
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last cop you showed me...</font>

571
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Wait. Steve was going
through a tough time.</font>

572
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threw up in my lap.</font>

573
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about that.</font>

574
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting him near you lap
is gonna be the challenge.</font>

575
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, speak of the devil.</font>

576
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Rust.
Martin.</font>

577
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Maggie.
Hi, Rust.</font>

578
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jennifer.
Rustin.</font>

579
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:28,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you.</font>

580
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:33,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you walk over here?</font>

581
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:43,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... OK.</font>

582
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just when I thought he
couldn't get any stranger.</font>

583
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:55,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious?</font>

584
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tastes colors.</font>

585
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what is synesesia?</font>

586
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:01,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Synesthesia.</font>

587
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a misalignment
of synaptic receptors</font>

588
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">and triggers...
Alkalis, colors,</font>

589
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">certain metallics.</font>

590
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a type
of hyper sensitivity.</font>

591
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">One sense triggers
another sense.</font>

592
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I'll see a color,</font>

593
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it'll put a taste
in my mouth.</font>

594
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:27,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">A touch, a texture, a scent
may put a note in my head.</font>

595
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard that.</font>

596
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can be a side effect
of a statin.</font>

597
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a side effect.</font>

598
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:33,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when something feels good,</font>

599
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">does that mean it
feels twice as good,</font>

600
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">like from two different ways?</font>

601
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could.
Yeah.</font>

602
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:47,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">The waitress
will bring them, babe.</font>

603
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wait?
I'll be right back.</font>

604
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refill and two rums.</font>

605
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh...</font>

606
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Can I have
another beer?</font>

607
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

608
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

609
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it look like?</font>

610
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on a date.
Aren't you?</font>

611
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh.</font>

612
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:32,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">So are you gonna go home
with this guy? Huh?</font>

613
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really none
of your business.</font>

614
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you fuck your wife?</font>

615
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you
want me to do? Look.</font>

616
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:44,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your way of
trying to talk divorce?</font>

617
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, Marty,
I don't want to marry you.</font>

618
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my whole point.
It's just run its course.</font>

619
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it hasn't. Come here.
Have a shot with me.</font>

620
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna play
a little something</font>

621
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">everybody should dance to.</font>

622
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:12,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I didn't just
come here to drink, you know.</font>

623
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:16,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me just set this down.</font>

624
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be fun.</font>

625
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

626
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:39,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

627
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nothing.</font>

628
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought I saw a guy who
supposed to be in parish.</font>

629
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's Alaska like?</font>

630
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

631
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not Paris, but it's clean,</font>

632
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:02,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's clear.</font>

633
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been to Paris?</font>

634
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a month.</font>

635
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you do in Paris?</font>

636
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:14,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mainly just got drunk
in front of Notre Dame.</font>

637
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each stilled body
so certain</font>

638
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:29,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they were more than the sum
of their urges,</font>

639
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:34,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the useless spinning,
tired mind,</font>

640
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:38,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">collision of desire
and ignorance.</font>

641
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked
about the interrogations.</font>

642
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know the truth?</font>

643
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:50,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never been in a room
more than 10 minutes</font>

644
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know whether
the guy did it or not.</font>

645
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it take you?</font>

646
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:02,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust spent a lot of off duty
running DBs,</font>

647
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">weeks of it,
coon hound in another life.</font>

648
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:08,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coon hound?</font>

649
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant raccoon hound.</font>

650
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:15,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody is a fucking
drama queen nowadays.</font>

651
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Look.</font>

652
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:21,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">If working his theories,
if his job</font>

653
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">was his idea of himself, fine.</font>

654
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the rest of us
had families,</font>

655
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:30,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">people in our lives,
good things.</font>

656
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">People give you rules.</font>

657
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rules describe the shape
of things.</font>

658
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

659
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you!</font>

660
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, Marty, get out of here.</font>

661
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Fuck, Marty." Is that
all you got for me?</font>

662
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it. Go home.
I don't want this anymore.</font>

663
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got that little
shitbird in here?</font>

664
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away.
I'll call the cops.</font>

665
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's see how that
works out for you.</font>

666
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know other cops.
OK.</font>

667
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.
Marty, get out.</font>

668
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she said she was single.</font>

669
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty, God!
Stop! Stop it!</font>

670
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she suck your dick, huh?</font>

671
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

672
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:17,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">She suck your fucking dick?</font>

673
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:20,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!
Get out! Get off.</font>

674
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off!</font>

675
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:22,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
You try it?</font>

676
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you tell me, or I'll have</font>

677
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">some Ninth Ward prison queen
wearing your face for a condom.</font>

678
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she suck your dick?</font>

679
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just for a little bit.</font>

680
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off.</font>

681
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stop it.</font>

682
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:45,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I got
in your face, guy.</font>

683
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:49,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't have really
done something like that.</font>

684
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a psycho.</font>

685
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:03,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I always said
I think Rust needed a family.</font>

686
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:09,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's boundaries.
Boundaries are good.</font>

687
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Cohle.</font>

688
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rust, you're home.</font>

689
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me.
Yeah. What's wrong?</font>

690
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

691
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve Geraci said
he caught something.</font>

692
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needed help.</font>

693
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost called the station,
but what's the point?</font>

694
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:55,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know they lie.</font>

695
00:42:57,106 --> 00:43:00,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to put you on the spot.</font>

696
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know if it's true?</font>

697
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't hear anything,</font>

698
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then again, I wouldn't.</font>

699
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Geraci wouldn't pull me.</font>

700
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hates me.</font>

701
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You drop Jen at home?</font>

702
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:28,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I walked her
to the door.</font>

703
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:30,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't go in?</font>

704
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:31,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to fall in love</font>

705
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">at first sight, you know.</font>

706
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I know. Look.</font>

707
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's nice, pretty.</font>

708
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's comfort there, Rust.</font>

709
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:41,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you guys
would be good together</font>

710
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you gave it a chance.</font>

711
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys don't
give things chances.</font>

712
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why that is.</font>

713
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because we
know what we want</font>

714
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we don't mind being alone.</font>

715
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to bed, Maggie.</font>

716
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:03,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty'll be home.
Take care.</font>

717
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit,
3 days in a row.</font>

718
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a new personal record?</font>

719
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:16,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off.</font>

720
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take my first shit
through your sunroof.</font>

721
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:22,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, I found one, I think,</font>

722
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">another girl from earlier.</font>

723
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

724
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">3 years ago,
a flood in Abbeville,</font>

725
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">they pulled this girl
out of the river.</font>

726
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:34,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it.</font>

727
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:37,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says here that her
death was accidental...</font>

728
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:39,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drowned, water in the lungs.</font>

729
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that him?</font>

730
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coroner says the branches
and debris from the flood</font>

731
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">caused these injuries,
all right?</font>

732
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand the ribs and
the arms, but the hyoid?</font>

733
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:49,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still...
No fucking way.</font>

734
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this,
lacerations to the abdomen,</font>

735
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">plus she was positive
for meth and LSD.</font>

736
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said she was high, fell in.</font>

737
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

738
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the posterior.</font>

739
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:07,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit.
Yeah.</font>

machinist. You're up.</font>

748
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,059

in the case, boss.</font>

749
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:34,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were
handing that off.</font>

750
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">What break?</font>

751
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">KA of the victim.
Might've known the killer, boss.</font>

752
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might've seen him.
We follow up.</font>

753

<font color="#FFFFFF">We still got a few days.</font>

754
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,806

goes to task force.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">but why'd he keep the box, huh?</font>

830
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he ask himself?</font>

831
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I guess,
that's one way to do it...</font>

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">This...</font>

914
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I'm talking about.</font>

915
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:39,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I mean</font>

916
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:43,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I'm talking
about time and death</font>

917
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and futility.</font>

918
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are broader ideas at work,</font>

919
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">mainly what is owed
between us as a society</font>

920
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">for our mutual illusions.</font>

921
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">14 straight hours
of staring at DBs,</font>

922
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:01,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">these are the things
you think of.</font>

923
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever done that? Hmm?</font>

924
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look in their eyes,
even in a picture.</font>

925
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:11,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter
if they're dead or alive.</font>

926
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can still read them,
and you know what you see?</font>

927
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:20,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">They welcomed it,</font>

928
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">mm-hmm, not at first,</font>

929
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">but right there
in the last instant.</font>

930
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:31,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">It an unmistakable relief,
see, because they were afraid</font>

931
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now they saw
for the very first time</font>

932
00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:39,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">how easy it was to just let go,
and they saw...</font>

933
00:55:39,034 --> 00:55:45,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">In that last nanosecond,
they saw what they were,</font>

934
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:48,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you, yourself,
this whole big drama,</font>

935
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was never anything
but a jerry-rig</font>

936
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:55,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">of presumption and dumb will
and you could just let go</font>

937
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:59,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">finally now that you didn't have
to hold on so tight...</font>

938
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:05,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">to realize that all your life...</font>

939
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, all your love,
all your hate,</font>

940
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:11,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">all your memory, all your pain...
It was all the same thing.</font>

941
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all the same dream,
a dream that you had</font>

942
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">inside a locked room,</font>

943
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:24,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">a dream about being a person...</font>

944
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">and like a lot of dreams...</font>

945
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:42,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a monster
at the end of it.</font>
