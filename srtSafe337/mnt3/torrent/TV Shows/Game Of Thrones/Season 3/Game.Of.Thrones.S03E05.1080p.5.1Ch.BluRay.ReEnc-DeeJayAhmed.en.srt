<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord,</font>

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">cast your light upon us.</font>

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of Light, defend us.</font>

4
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show us the truth.</font>

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike this man down if he is guilty.</font>

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give strength to his sword if he is true.</font>

7
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of Light, give us wisdom,</font>

8
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the night is dark and full of terrors.</font>

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the night is
dark and full of terrors.</font>

10
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back.</font>

11
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</font>

12
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.</font>

13
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guilty.
- Kill him!</font>

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord, cast your
light upon this man, your servant.</font>

15
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back from
death and darkness. Restore his flame.</font>

16
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the night is dark and full of terrors.</font>

17
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord, cast...
- Arya, don't!</font>

18
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back
from death and darkness...</font>

19
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Let go of me! Let me go!</font>

20
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like their god
likes me more than your butcher's boy.</font>

21
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn in hell!</font>

22
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">He Will.</font>

23
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not today.</font>

24
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.</font>

25
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what you know.</font>

26
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are four to a patrol, two builders
to check for structural damage,</font>

27
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">two rangers to watch for enemies.</font>

28
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">How often do these patrols go out?</font>

29
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">It varies.</font>

30
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I knew where on the Wall
we were heading, I could tell you.</font>

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like to know that.</font>

32
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.</font>

33
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many are manned?</font>

34
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three.</font>

35
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure of that?</font>

36
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which three?</font>

37
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Castle Black.</font>

38
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, Castle Black.</font>

39
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows Castle Black.</font>

40
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which others?</font>

41
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.</font>

42
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men remain in Castle Black?</font>

43
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A thousand.
- Liar.</font>

44
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens to your
eagle after I kill you?</font>

45
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he drift away
like a kite with his strings cut,</font>

46
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">or does he just flop dead to the ground?</font>

47
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's no crow.</font>

48
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 'cause you want him
inside, you don't make him one of us.</font>

49
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid of you.</font>

50
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you, boy.</font>

51
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you lie to me, I'll pull
your guts out through your throat.</font>

52
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">A thousand men.</font>

53
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find out soon enough.</font>

54
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need you to protect me.</font>

55
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you do.</font>

56
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?</font>

57
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who vouched for you with Mance?</font>

58
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems you owe me a debt.</font>

59
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it back.</font>

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I stole it.</font>

61
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mine. If you want
it, come steal it back.</font>

62
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte!</font>

63
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte!</font>

64
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte! Seven hells.</font>

65
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte!</font>

66
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Orell right? Are you still a crow?</font>

67
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time you proved yourself.</font>

68
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte!</font>

69
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore some vows.</font>

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to break 'em.</font>

71
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to see me.</font>

72
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of me.</font>

73
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't.</font>

74
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should.</font>

75
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you still dressed?
You know nothing, Jon Snow.</font>

76
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thing you did with your mouth...</font>

77
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what lords
do to their ladies in the South?</font>

78
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.</font>

79
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

80
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seemed to like it.</font>

81
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, I liked it some.</font>

82
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who taught you that?</font>

83
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been no one else. Only you.</font>

84
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">A maid. You were a maid.</font>

85
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a man of the Night's Watch.</font>

86
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you? Were you a maid?</font>

87
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

88
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was he?</font>

89
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a boy.</font>

90
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came trading with his brothers.</font>

91
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire. But...</font>

92
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was weak. Not like you.</font>

93
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the first one.
Then there was this Thenn boy.</font>

94
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spoke no Common,
but, Gods, he was built like a mammoth...</font>

95
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.</font>

96
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd best get back.</font>

97
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tormund...</font>

98
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not done with you yet.</font>

99
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long's it been since you had a bath?</font>

100
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not go back.</font>

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's stay here a while longer.</font>

102
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't ever want to leave
this cave, Jon Snow.</font>

103
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not ever.</font>

104
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want my gold.</font>

105
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says clearly on that
note, you'll be paid when the war is over.</font>

106
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.</font>

107
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're outlaws. Outlaws
steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.</font>

108
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come try it, archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.</font>

109
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.</font>

110
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in the eyes of God.</font>

111
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't!
- Enough!</font>

112
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">The judgment isn't ours to make.</font>

113
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.</font>

114
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riders coming through!</font>

115
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kingslayer.</font>

116
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Down!</font>

117
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your knees.</font>

118
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.</font>

119
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick him up, Locke.</font>

120
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've lost a hand.</font>

121
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord, he has it here.</font>

122
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this away.</font>

123
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send it to his father?</font>

124
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.</font>

125
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut her free.</font>

126
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies, my lady.
You're under my protection now.</font>

127
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my lord.</font>

128
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find suitable rooms for our guests.</font>

129
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll speak later.</font>

130
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton.</font>

131
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there word from the capital?</font>

132
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't heard?</font>

133
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.</font>

134
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.</font>

135
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your sister...</font>

136
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I put this?</font>

137
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister...</font>

138
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls alive and well.</font>

139
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father's forces prevailed.</font>

140
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Jaime isn't well.</font>

141
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him to Qyburn.</font>

142
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I die?</font>

143
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

144
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.</font>

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The safest course
would be to take the whole arm off.</font>

146
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll die.</font>

147
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no maester.</font>

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your chain?</font>

149
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Citadel stripped me of it.</font>

150
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found some of my experiments too bold.</font>

151
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.</font>

152
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need my right hand to kill you.</font>

153
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can take away the rotting flesh</font>

154
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">and try and burn
out the corruption with boiling wine.</font>

155
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

156
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">With any luck, that will suffice.</font>

157
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need milk of the poppy.</font>

158
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">No milk of the poppy.</font>

159
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be pain.</font>

160
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll scream.</font>

161
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a bit of pain.</font>

162
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll scream loudly.</font>

163
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish.</font>

164
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

165
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.</font>

166
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Your Grace.</font>

167
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that House Tyrell don't hold the
crown's best interests at heart.</font>

168
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see. And have you
shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?</font>

169
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.</font>

170
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myself, I often find them a hindrance.</font>

171
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he appreciates
those who aid his family, as you well know.</font>

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's almost as generous
to those who help us</font>

173
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.</font>

174
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a good
working relationship with the Tyrells.</font>

175
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might
look into it before you leave the capital.</font>

176
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.</font>

177
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your best will prove better than</font>

178
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?</font>

179
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you that it will.</font>

180
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.</font>

181
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.</font>

182
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are there any figs? Fetch some.</font>

183
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always take figs
midafternoon. They help move the bowels.</font>

184
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what do I owe this summons?</font>

185
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for seeing me, my lady.</font>

186
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.</font>

187
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?</font>

188
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.</font>

189
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naturally.</font>

190
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's shaping up to be a
very involved affair.</font>

191
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">The word "extravagant" has been used.</font>

192
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">What good is the word "extravagant"</font>

193
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?</font>

194
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I understand that.
- Good.</font>

195
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me</font>

196
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">to calculate the cost for the crown.</font>

197
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">As of now, it's a huge expense.</font>

198
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

199
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're at war, Lady Olenna.</font>

200
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.</font>

201
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maintaining supply lines...</font>

202
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't think how it slipped my mind.</font>

203
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, 12,000
infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?</font>

204
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support.</font>

205
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Provisions, so this city
might survive the winter.</font>

206
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">A million bushels of wheat.</font>

207
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.</font>

208
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep.</font>

209
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.</font>

210
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite familiar with them.</font>

211
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are grateful for your contributions,</font>

212
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.</font>

213
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">As is a royal wedding.</font>

214
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people are hungry
for more than just food.</font>

215
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">They crave distractions.</font>

216
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.</font>

217
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">And their distractions are likely to</font>

218
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">end with us being torn to pieces.</font>

219
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">A royal wedding is much
safer. Wouldn't you say?</font>

220
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would.</font>

221
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">And traditionally paid
for by the royal family.</font>

222
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was told you were drunk,
impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.</font>

223
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine my disappointment at finding</font>

224
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.</font>

225
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you go for them, Volantis?</font>

226
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My lady...
- Oh, very well.</font>

227
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't have it said
that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.</font>

228
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll pay for half,
and the celebrations will go on as planned.</font>

229
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that sufficient?
- Quite. Thank you.</font>

230
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.</font>

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me that.</font>

232
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

233
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just mending Lord Beric's armor.</font>

234
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

235
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to stay and smith
for the Brotherhood.</font>

236
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you lost your mind?</font>

237
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Lannisters find this place,</font>

238
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">you think they'll spare the smiths?</font>

239
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll cave your head in.</font>

240
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanted to kill me
long before I joined the Brotherhood.</font>

241
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to.</font>

242
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to. They need good men.</font>

243
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.</font>

244
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you...</font>

245
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Serve him?</font>

246
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've served men my entire life.</font>

247
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I served Master Mott at King's Landing,
and he sold me to the Watch.</font>

248
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,</font>

249
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.</font>

250
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm done serving.
- You just said you were serving Lord Beric.</font>

251
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">He may be their leader, but they chose him.</font>

252
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men are brothers. They're a family.</font>

253
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never had a family.</font>

254
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can be your family.</font>

255
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't be my family.
You'd be "my lady."</font>

256
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem.</font>

257
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem!</font>

258
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a rescue?</font>

259
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lannister filth! Take him!</font>

260
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I didn't do anything.</font>

261
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a squire. Please...</font>

262
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring them in.</font>

263
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that all of them?</font>

264
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took five of you
to murder two unarmed squires?</font>

265
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.</font>

266
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vengeance?</font>

267
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those boys didn't kill your sons.</font>

268
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield, and Torrhen...</font>

269
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was strangled by the Kingslayer.</font>

270
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They were his kin.
- They were boys!</font>

271
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at them.</font>

272
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your mother to look at them.</font>

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">She killed them as much as I.</font>

274
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother had nothing to do with
this. This was your treason.</font>

275
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's treason to free your enemies.</font>

276
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">In war, you kill your enemies.</font>

277
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your father not teach you that, boy?</font>

278
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leave him.</font>

279
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

280
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me to the King.</font>

281
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.</font>

282
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how he
deals with treason. Our King in the North.</font>

283
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I call him</font>

284
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">the King Who Lost the North?</font>

285
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon. Hang the rest.</font>

286
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mercy! I didn't kill
anyone. I only watched for the guards.</font>

287
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one was only the watcher.</font>

288
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang him last, so he can
watch the others die.</font>

289
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please! Please, no. They made me do it!
They made me! They made me!</font>

290
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word of this can't leave Riverrun.</font>

291
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.</font>

292
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters pay their debts.</font>

293
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never stop talking about it.</font>

294
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you make me a liar as well?</font>

295
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wouldn't be lying.</font>

296
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will bury them
and remain silent until the war is done.</font>

297
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not fighting for justice</font>

298
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,</font>

299
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter how highborn.</font>

300
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has to die.</font>

301
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't
forgive the killing of their lord.</font>

302
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother's right. If you do this,
the Karstarks will abandon you.</font>

303
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tended to their wounds.</font>

304
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought them supper. Now they're dead.</font>

305
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.</font>

306
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need Karstark men to end it.</font>

307
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.</font>

308
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hostage.</font>

309
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the Karstarks that as long as they're
loyal, he will not be harmed.</font>

310
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blood of the First Men flows through</font>

311
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">my veins as much as yours, boy.</font>

312
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought the Mad King for your father.</font>

313
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought Joffrey for you.</font>

314
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are kin, Stark and Karstark.</font>

315
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">That didn't stop you from betraying
me, and it won't save you now.</font>

316
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want it to save me. I want it
to haunt you to the end of your days.</font>

317
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kneel, my lord.</font>

318
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold,</font>

319
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">here, in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.</font>

320
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you speak a final word?</font>

321
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.</font>

322
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey.</font>

323
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei.</font>

324
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ilyn Payne.</font>

325
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Meryn.</font>

326
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound.</font>

327
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do with me?</font>

328
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first light we'll ride for
Riverrun. Your brother's there now.</font>

329
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll make a contribution to our
cause, and you can go home.</font>

330
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a hostage and you're selling me.</font>

331
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think of it that way.</font>

332
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is that Way.</font>

333
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

334
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it isn't.</font>

335
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">More is than isn't.</font>

336
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.</font>

337
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.</font>

338
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, why don't you?</font>

339
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need the gold.</font>

340
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I frighten you, child?</font>

341
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

342
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're angry with me,
and I don't blame you,</font>

343
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">but letting him go was the right thing.</font>

344
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have more reason to want him hanged.</font>

345
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he killed you.</font>

346
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did.</font>

347
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how...</font>

348
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thoros, how many times
have you brought me back?</font>

349
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Lord of Light who brings you back.</font>

350
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.</font>

351
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times?</font>

352
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five, I think.</font>

353
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this makes six.</font>

354
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six.</font>

355
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was the first time. The Mountain.</font>

356
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show her.</font>

357
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lance right through the chest.</font>

358
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I was stabbed in the belly.</font>

359
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it was an arrow in the back.</font>

360
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that ax in the side.</font>

361
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.</font>

362
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?</font>

363
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.</font>

364
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Hound makes six.</font>

365
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.</font>

366
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think you'd learn.</font>

367
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not getting any easier, you know.</font>

368
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

369
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I come back,</font>

370
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bit less.</font>

371
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pieces of you get chipped away.</font>

372
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you bring back a man without a head?</font>

373
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not six times. Just once.</font>

374
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it works that way, child.</font>

375
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good man, Ned Stark.
He's at rest now, somewhere.</font>

376
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never wish my life upon him.</font>

377
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would.</font>

378
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're alive.</font>

379
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord, cast your light upon me.</font>

380
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protect me in the darkness.</font>

381
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn away my sins.</font>

382
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me serve you.</font>

383
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use me as you will.</font>

384
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the night is dark and full of terrors.</font>

385
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.</font>

386
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

387
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant to come sooner.</font>

388
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle...</font>

389
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know of your troubles, my King.</font>

390
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.</font>

391
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course.</font>

392
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true. You will be victorious.</font>

393
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believed that once.</font>

394
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the One God's champion and
the finest man I've ever known.</font>

395
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selyse.</font>

396
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've broken a sacred vow.</font>

397
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've sinned.</font>

398
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

399
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've wronged you.</font>

400
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have shamed you.</font>

401
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing God's work.</font>

402
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand.</font>

403
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Red Woman...</font>

404
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lady Melisandre...</font>

405
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, Stannis.</font>

406
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.</font>

407
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No act done in service
of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.</font>

408
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she told me,</font>

409
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wept with JOY-</font>

410
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my sweet boys.</font>

411
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petyr, Tommard, Edric.</font>

412
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thank God every day
for bringing Melisandre to us.</font>

413
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">She gave you a son.</font>

414
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you</font>

415
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- nothing.
- That's not true.</font>

416
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you've come to see her as well?</font>

417
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no need.</font>

418
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must keep away from such distractions.</font>

419
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's my daughter.</font>

420
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see her.</font>

421
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a king.
You don't need my permission.</font>

422
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sea
I know, I know</font>

423
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, oh</font>

424
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">The birds have scales</font>

425
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the fish take wing</font>

426
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I know</font>

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, oh</font>

428
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shireen.</font>

429
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father!</font>

430
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've grown since I last saw you.</font>

431
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother said you fought in a battle.</font>

432
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you win?</font>

433
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

434
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did the Onion Knight come back with you?</font>

435
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did. He fought bravely.</font>

436
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't come to visit me.</font>

437
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he'd bring
me back a present from the capital.</font>

438
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't be visiting, child.</font>

439
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not? He's my friend.</font>

440
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

441
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made this for me.</font>

442
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't tell Mother I have it.
It's a secret.</font>

443
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.</font>

444
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Davos is a traitor.</font>

445
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.</font>

446
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best forget him.</font>

447
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.</font>

448
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

449
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a bath.</font>

450
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me out of these rags.</font>

451
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now get out.</font>

452
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another tub.</font>

453
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one suits me fine.</font>

454
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. I'm not interested.</font>

455
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I faint, pull me out.</font>

456
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't intend to be
the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.</font>

457
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I care how you die?</font>

458
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore a solemn vow, remember?</font>

459
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to
get me to King's Landing in one piece.</font>

460
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not going so well, is it?</font>

461
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder Renly died,
with you guarding him.</font>

462
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was unworthy. Forgive me.</font>

463
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You protected me better than most...
- Don't you mock me.</font>

464
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm apologizing.</font>

465
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.</font>

466
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need trust to have a truce.</font>

467
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you.</font>

468
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is. There's the look.</font>

469
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen it for 17 years,
on face after face.</font>

470
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all despise me.</font>

471
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.</font>

472
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man without honor.</font>

473
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've heard of wildfire?</font>

474
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

475
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mad King was obsessed with it.</font>

476
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved to watch people burn,</font>

477
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way their skin blackened and
blistered and melted off their bones.</font>

478
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">He burned lords he didn't like.</font>

479
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">He burned Hands who disobeyed him.</font>

480
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">He burned anyone who was against him.</font>

481
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before long, half the
country was against him.</font>

482
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aerys saw traitors everywhere,</font>

483
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire all over the city,</font>

484
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">beneath the Sept of Baelor
and the slums of Flea Bottom.</font>

485
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under houses, stables, taverns.</font>

486
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even beneath the Red Keep itself.</font>

487
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, the day of reckoning came.</font>

488
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Baratheon marched on the capital</font>

489
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">after his victory at the Trident.</font>

490
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my father arrived first,
with the whole Lannister army at his back,</font>

491
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">promising to defend the city
against the rebels.</font>

492
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew my father better than that.</font>

493
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's never been one to
pick the losing side.</font>

494
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told the Mad King as much.</font>

495
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I urged him to surrender peacefully.</font>

496
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the King didn't listen to me.</font>

497
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't listen to Varys,
who tried to warn him.</font>

498
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,</font>

499
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">that gray, sunken cunt.</font>

500
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.</font>

501
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Lannisters have always been
true friends of the crown."</font>

502
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we opened the gates,
and my father sacked the city.</font>

503
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once again, I came to the King,
begging him to surrender.</font>

504
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me to bring him my father's head.</font>

505
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he turned to his pyromancer.</font>

506
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Burn them all," he said.</font>

507
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."</font>

508
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, if your precious Renly</font>

509
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">commanded you to kill your own father</font>

510
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stand by while thousands of men,</font>

511
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">women, and children burned alive,</font>

512
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you have done it?</font>

513
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you have kept your oath then?</font>

514
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, I killed the pyromancer.</font>

515
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, when the King turned to flee,</font>

516
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drove my sword into his back.</font>

517
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Burn them all,"
he kept saying. "Burn them all."</font>

518
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think he expected to die.</font>

519
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">He meant to burn with the rest of us</font>

520
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">and rise again,</font>

521
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">reborn as a dragon to
turn his enemies to ash.</font>

522
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I slit his throat to
make sure that didn't happen.</font>

523
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where Ned Stark found me.</font>

524
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is true...</font>

525
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell anyone?</font>

526
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?</font>

527
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark?</font>

528
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think the honorable Ned Stark</font>

529
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">wanted to hear my side?</font>

530
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">He judged me guilty
the moment he set eyes on me.</font>

531
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">By what right does the wolf judge the lion?</font>

532
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- By what right?
- Help! Help!</font>

533
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Kingslayer!</font>

534
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime. My name is Jaime.</font>

535
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.</font>

536
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?</font>

537
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh! You'll wake Bert.</font>

538
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben?</font>

539
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the fat one. He's
on guard duty tonight.</font>

540
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.</font>

541
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.</font>

542
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If your father knew...
- He said you were a traitor.</font>

543
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you?</font>

544
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am, child.</font>

545
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I disobeyed my king,
your father, and now I'm paying the price.</font>

546
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care. You're my friend.</font>

547
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must get bored
down here. I brought you something to read.</font>

548
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about Aegon and his dragons.</font>

549
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?</font>

550
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.</font>

551
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they did.</font>

552
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can hide the book under your cloak.</font>

553
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good one. I'll bring you more.</font>

554
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my lady. I'm
sure it's a fine book,</font>

555
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but it's wasted on me.
- Take it.</font>

556
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have more.</font>

557
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, I can't read the words.</font>

558
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't?</font>

559
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.</font>

560
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.</font>

561
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. We can't.</font>

562
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not? What will they
do, lock us in cells?</font>

563
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wouldn't know where to start.
- At the beginning.</font>

564
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">This word is "Aegon."</font>

565
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you see
and "G" together like that,</font>

566
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">it sounds like "egg."</font>

567
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the title of the whole book</font>

568
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">is An History of Aegon the
Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.</font>

569
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a bitch of a siege.
Mmm.</font>

570
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were first through the breach at Pyke?</font>

571
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second.</font>

572
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thoros of Myr went in
alone, waving that flaming sword of his.</font>

573
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.</font>

574
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert knighted you after the battle?</font>

575
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proudest moment of my life.</font>

576
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">One knee in the dust,
the King's sword on my shoulder,</font>

577
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">listening to the words,</font>

578
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."</font>

579
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.</font>

580
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">In full plate metal for 16 hours.</font>

581
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.</font>

582
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was very nearly the first man</font>

583
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">knighted to piss on the King's boots.</font>

584
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert would have laughed.</font>

585
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good man, a great warrior.</font>

586
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a terrible king.</font>

587
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.</font>

588
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You swore an oath.
- Yes.</font>

589
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a man of honor keeps his vows,</font>

590
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.</font>

591
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just once in my life before it's over,</font>

592
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know
what it's like to serve with pride,</font>

593
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fight for someone I believe in.</font>

594
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe in her?</font>

595
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all my heart.</font>

596
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are the ones?</font>

597
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Khaleesi. The officers.</font>

598
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not choose this life.</font>

599
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are free men now.
And free men make their own choices.</font>

600
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you selected your own leader
from amongst your ranks?</font>

601
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remove your helmet.</font>

602
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one has the honor.</font>

603
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name?</font>

604
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grey Worm.</font>

605
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grey Worm.</font>

606
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Unsullied boys
are given new names when they are cut.</font>

607
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.</font>

608
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Names that remind them what they are...</font>

609
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vermin.</font>

610
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">From this day forward,
you will choose your own names.</font>

611
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will tell your fellow soldiers
to do the same.</font>

612
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw away your slave name.</font>

613
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Choose the name your parents gave you,
or any other.</font>

614
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">A name that gives you pride.</font>

615
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Grey Worm" gives me pride.
It is a lucky name.</font>

616
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">The name this one was born
with was cursed.</font>

617
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the name he had when he
was taken as a slave.</font>

618
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Grey Worm is the name this one had</font>

619
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.</font>

620
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert wanted her dead.</font>

621
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.</font>

622
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose no one on the Small
Council could speak sense to him.</font>

623
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't sit on the Small Council.</font>

624
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

625
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally...</font>

626
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traditionally, yes,</font>

627
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.</font>

628
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't want advice on how to govern</font>

629
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a man who had fought for the Mad King.</font>

630
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say I minded much.</font>

631
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always hated the politics.</font>

632
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I imagine I would, too.</font>

633
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hours spent jabbering about
backstabbings and betrayals the world over.</font>

634
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

635
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, she'll have to
wade through that muck</font>

636
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

637
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll have good men around her</font>

638
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">to advise her, men with experience.</font>

639
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which men do you have in mind?</font>

640
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me for what I'm about to say,</font>

641
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your reputation
in Westeros has suffered over the years.</font>

642
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.</font>

643
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if your presence by her side</font>

644
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">will help our cause when we go home.</font>

645
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our cause?</font>

646
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy defending the Khaleesi</font>

647
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">against King Robert's assassins</font>

648
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you were still bowing to the man.</font>

649
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?</font>

650
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only joined us a few days ago.</font>

651
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't speak to your intentions.</font>

652
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're truly her loyal servants,</font>

653
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">we will do whatever needs to be done,</font>

654
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter the cost, no matter our pride.</font>

655
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not Lord Commander
here. You're just another exile.</font>

656
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I take my orders from the Queen.</font>

657
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to bed.</font>

658
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

659
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Karstarks are gone.</font>

660
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost half our forces.</font>

661
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to
do to make us unravel.</font>

662
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

663
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only wait.</font>

664
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let him.</font>

665
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do? Attack King's Landing?</font>

666
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing
he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.</font>

667
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could ride north.</font>

668
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your land back
from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.</font>

669
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winter could last five years.</font>

670
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once my bannermen are home again,</font>

671
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,</font>

672
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">warm and safe, they'll
never ride south again.</font>

673
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I gathered my lords
together, we had a purpose, a mission.</font>

674
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're like a band
of bickering children.</font>

675
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give them a new purpose.</font>

676
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

677
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.</font>

678
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

679
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're here.</font>

680
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Landing...</font>

681
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

682
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't force them to meet us in the field</font>

683
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,</font>

684
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can attack them where they're not.</font>

685
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Casterly Rock can't run away.</font>

686
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to take their
home away from them.</font>

687
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do it?</font>

688
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need men to
replace the Karstarks who marched home.</font>

689
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is only one person in this kingdom</font>

690
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.</font>

691
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry.</font>

692
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walder Frey.</font>

693
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's such a splendid fighter.</font>

694
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea when we might...</font>

695
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.</font>

696
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should grow quickly.</font>

697
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey won't let me leave.
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.</font>

698
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And only one to let you go.</font>

699
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it will please me.</font>

700
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squire.</font>

701
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well fought, ser.</font>

702
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was no fight.</font>

703
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know you.</font>

704
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Olyver, if it please you.</font>

705
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should like to
see you spar with a proper partner, ser.</font>

706
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know?</font>

707
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what?</font>

708
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I wanted to.</font>

709
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord...</font>

710
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,</font>

711
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.</font>

712
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">They rarely do, in my experience.</font>

713
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a good deal of experience, do you?</font>

714
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the husbands.</font>

715
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">That didn't take long.</font>

716
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it took long enough.</font>

717
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems
our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.</font>

718
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he?</font>

719
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

720
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's the lucky girl?</font>

721
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">She may
not be the grandest ship in the world</font>

722
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the fastest,</font>

723
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she's mine.</font>

724
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.</font>

725
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange, isn't it?</font>

726
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

727
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter what we want,</font>

728
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">once we get it, then we
want something else.</font>

729
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hair is different.</font>

730
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

731
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Margaery wears it that way.</font>

732
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many ladies wear it this way.</font>

733
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have good news. I'll be
leaving the city soon.</font>

734
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still want me to come with you?</font>

735
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a question of what I want.
It's what you want.</font>

736
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to go home, don't you?</font>

737
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. More than anything.</font>

738
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe it would be better to wait.</font>

739
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking how dangerous it would
be. Not just for me, but for you.</font>

740
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been so kind. I'd feel
terrible if anything happened to you.</font>

741
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you how touched I am</font>

742
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">by your concern for my welfare.</font>

743
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you know that I'm
your friend, Sansa.</font>

744
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your true friend.</font>

745
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do, Lord Baelish.</font>

746
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petyr.</font>

747
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wish to stay,
then of course you will stay.</font>

748
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll speak again when I return.</font>

749
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're late.</font>

750
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's she doing here?</font>

751
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our business concerns her, too.</font>

752
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

753
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be pleased to learn that</font>

754
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,</font>

755
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've saved the crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.</font>

756
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.</font>

757
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.</font>

758
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.</font>

759
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister has learned
that your new friends the Tyrells</font>

760
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.</font>

761
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. She's a lovely girl.</font>

762
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missing some of Loras' favorite
bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.</font>

763
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your jokes are not appreciated.</font>

764
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't my best, but...</font>

765
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bring them into the royal fold,
and this is how they repay me,</font>

766
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">by trying to steal
the key to the North out from under me.</font>

767
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to
remember she has an older brother.</font>

768
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Karstarks have marched home.</font>

769
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Young Wolf has
lost half his army. His days are numbered.</font>

770
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.</font>

771
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell,</font>

772
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.</font>

773
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.</font>

774
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think it's
wise to refuse them?</font>

775
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.</font>

776
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plots are not public knowledge.</font>

777
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.</font>

778
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.</font>

779
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do we do that?</font>

780
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">We find Sansa Stark a different husband.</font>

781
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful.</font>

782
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

783
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't mean it.</font>

784
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can and I do.</font>

785
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey's made this poor
girl's life miserable</font>

786
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">since the day he took her father's head.</font>

787
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now she's finally
free of him, and you give her to me?</font>

788
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cruel, even for you.</font>

789
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you intend on mistreating her?</font>

790
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl's happiness
is not my concern, nor yours.</font>

791
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a child!</font>

792
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's flowered, I assure
you. She and I have discussed it at length.</font>

793
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, you see? You will wed her,</font>

794
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">bed her, and put a child in her.</font>

795
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely you're capable of that.</font>

796
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I refuse?</font>

797
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.</font>

798
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa Stark is a finer
reward than you could ever dare hope for.</font>

799
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is past time you were wed.</font>

800
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wed.</font>

801
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or don't you remember?</font>

802
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only too well.</font>

803
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be thanking the Gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.</font>

804
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.</font>

805
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

806
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll marry Ser Loras.</font>

807
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not.</font>

808
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy is heir to Highgarden.</font>

809
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.</font>

810
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I won't do it.</font>

811
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you will.</font>

812
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.</font>

813
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.</font>

814
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my daughter!</font>

815
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will do as I command,
and you will marry Loras Tyrell</font>

816
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put an end to the disgusting
rumors about you once and for all.</font>

817
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, don't make me do it again, please.</font>

818
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not another word.</font>

819
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">My children.</font>

820
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've disgraced
the Lannister name for far too long.</font>
