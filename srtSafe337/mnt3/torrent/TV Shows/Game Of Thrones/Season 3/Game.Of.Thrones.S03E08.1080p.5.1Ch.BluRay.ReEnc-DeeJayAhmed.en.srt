1
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you one try, girl.</font>

2
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill me and you're free.</font>

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I live, I'll break both your hands.</font>

4
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, hit me.</font>

5
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit me hard.</font>

6
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sulk all you want.</font>

7
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, you're lucky.</font>

8
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to be alone out here, girl.</font>

9
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone worse than me would find you.</font>

10
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one worse than you.</font>

11
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never knew my brother.</font>

12
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">He once killed a man for snoring.</font>

13
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's plenty worse than me.</font>

14
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's men who like to beat little
girls, men who like to rape them.</font>

15
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saved your sister from some of them.</font>

16
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying-</font>

17
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask her, if you ever see her again.</font>

18
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask her who came back
for her when the mob had her on her back.</font>

19
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">They would have taken her every which way</font>

20
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">and left her there with
her throat cut open.</font>

21
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the Blackwater?</font>

22
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Blackwater?</font>

23
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think I'm taking you?</font>

24
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to King's Landing,
to Joffrey and the Queen.</font>

25
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen.</font>

26
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:06,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.</font>

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?</font>

28
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother and brother will be
there, and they'll pay me for you.</font>

29
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would they be at the Twins?</font>

30
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those outlaws
you love so much never told you?</font>

31
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole countryside is yapping about it.</font>

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.</font>

33
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">So quit trying to bash my skull in,</font>

34
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.</font>

35
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.</font>

36
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cannot be trusted.</font>

37
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can be
trusted to kill you if they're well paid.</font>

38
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Yunkish are paying them well.</font>

39
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know these men?</font>

40
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only by the broken swords on their banners.</font>

41
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're called the Second Sons.</font>

42
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan's Bastard.</font>

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he more titan or bastard?</font>

44
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi.
They all are.</font>

45
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many?</font>

46
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">2,000, Your Grace.
Armored and mounted.</font>

47
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to make a difference?</font>

48
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.</font>

49
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.</font>

50
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine you're right.</font>

51
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard about winning.</font>

52
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">He may not agree to meet.</font>

53
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will.</font>

54
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man who fights
for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.</font>

55
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, allow me to present</font>

56
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">The captains of the Second Sons,</font>

57
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mero of Braavos,</font>

58
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prendahl na Ghezn,</font>

59
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, um...</font>

60
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daario Naharis.</font>

61
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the Mother of Dragons?</font>

62
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.</font>

63
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind your tongue.</font>

64
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

65
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mind hers.</font>

66
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">She licked my ass like
she was born to do it.</font>

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, slave girl, bring wine.</font>

68
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no slaves here.</font>

69
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll all be
slaves after the battle, unless I save you.</font>

70
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap,</font>

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I may give you my Second Sons.</font>

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.</font>

73
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Barristan,
how many men fight for the Second Sons?</font>

74
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under 2,000, Your Grace.</font>

75
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have more, don't we?</font>

76
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">10,000 Unsullied.</font>

77
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,</font>

78
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself</font>

79
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.</font>

80
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.</font>

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have 8,000 Unsullied.</font>

82
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very young to be a captain.</font>

83
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.</font>

84
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if your numbers are right,</font>

85
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">the odds don't favor your side.</font>

86
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and won.</font>

87
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.</font>

88
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you could fight for me.</font>

89
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've taken
the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.</font>

90
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would pay you
as much and more.</font>

91
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our contract is our bond.</font>

92
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we break our bond,
no one will hire the Second Sons again.</font>

93
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ride with me
and you'll never need another contract.</font>

94
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have gold and
castles and lordships of your choosing</font>

95
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

96
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.</font>

97
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no cavalry.</font>

98
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fortnight ago, I had
no army. A year ago, I had no dragons.</font>

99
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have two days to decide.</font>

100
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me your cunt. I want to see</font>

101
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if it's worth fighting for.</font>

102
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Queen, shall I slice out
his tongue for you?</font>

103
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men are our guests.</font>

104
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to be enjoying my wine.</font>

105
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.</font>

106
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?</font>

107
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A barrel, then.
- Good.</font>

108
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.</font>

109
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Second Sons, we share everything.</font>

110
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the battle, maybe
we'll all share you.</font>

111
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come looking for
you when this is over.</font>

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Barristan,
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.</font>

113
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gladly, Your Grace.</font>

114
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half Robert, half lowborn.</font>

115
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show the boy to his chambers.</font>

116
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have the maids draw him
a bath and find him some decent clothes.</font>

117
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come visit you soon.</font>

118
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean to do with him?</font>

119
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.</font>

120
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?</font>

121
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it needs to be
done, do it. Don't torture the boy.</font>

122
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?</font>

123
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.</font>

125
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her panic seeps into
her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.</font>

126
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've slaughtered many lambs?</font>

127
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And none have seen the blade.</font>

128
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And though</font>

129
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,462

<font color="#FFFFFF">Two meals a day.</font>

145
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper. I cannot complain.</font>

146
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't belong in a place like this.</font>

147
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.</font>

00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

149
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about your son.</font>

150
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't get the chance to tell you before.</font>

151
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good lad. Loyal lad.</font>

152
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Melisandre's returned.</font>

153
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know she'd been gone.</font>

154
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Came back with a bastard boy.</font>

155
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert's bastard boy.</font>

156
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

157
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says there's power in king's blood.</font>

158
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to kill him.</font>

159
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sacrifice him.</font>

160
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,</font>

161
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?</font>

162
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy is your nephew.</font>

163
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of it? We're at war.</font>

164
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut</font>

165
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert bedded one drunken night?</font>

166
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he has your blood in his veins.</font>

167
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did Renly.</font>

168
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly wronged you.</font>

169
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly declared himself
king when the throne belonged to you.</font>

170
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">He raised an army, stole your bannermen.</font>

171
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">This boy has done you no harm.</font>

172
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an innocent.</font>

173
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many boys live in Westeros?</font>

174
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many girls?
How many men? How many women?</font>

175
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The darkness will devour them all, she
says. The night that never ends.</font>

176
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.</font>

177
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more than I asked to be king.</font>

178
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?</font>

179
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great or small, we must do our duty.</font>

180
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?</font>

181
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,
why did you come to see me today?</font>

182
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to free you.</font>

183
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you swear never to raise your hand
to the Lady Melisandre again.</font>

184
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it.</font>

185
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't swear never to speak against her.</font>

186
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have little regard for your own life.</font>

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none.</font>

188
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,</font>

189
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife</font>

190
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you knew I'd counsel restraint.</font>

191
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came to hear me
say it because you believe it yourself.</font>

192
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a man who
slaughters innocents for gain or glory.</font>

193
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my son was five, he said to me,</font>

194
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I don't ever want to die."</font>

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."</font>

196
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.</font>

197
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think mothers and
fathers made up the Gods</font>

198
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.</font>

199
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a vision in the flames.</font>

200
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great battle in the snow. I saw it.</font>

201
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you saw whatever she gave birth to.</font>

202
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never believed, but
when you see the truth,</font>

203
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">when it's right there in front of you,</font>

204
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">as real as these iron bars,
how can you deny her god is real?</font>

205
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dragon bitch. She talks too much.</font>

206
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk too much.</font>

207
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.</font>

208
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.</font>

209
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cock will find a way. Tell him.</font>

210
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any place that
my cock can't reach?</font>

211
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.</font>

212
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.</font>

213
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.</font>

214
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm no whore, my friend.</font>

215
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sells her sheath, and
you sell your blade.</font>

216
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.</font>

217
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For beauty?</font>

218
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">We fight for gold.</font>

219
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die,</font>

220
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">the thrill of fucking
a woman who wants to be fucked</font>

221
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the thrill
of killing a man who wants to kill you.</font>

222
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll die young.</font>

223
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do
about the dragon girl?</font>

224
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.</font>

225
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't be a battle,
and we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.</font>

226
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only have to deal with her.</font>

227
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's well guarded.</font>

228
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight's a new moon.</font>

229
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.</font>

230
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one of us?</font>

231
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes, love.</font>

232
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three coins.</font>

233
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">A coin from Meereen,</font>

234
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">a coin from Volantis,</font>

235
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a coin from Braavos.</font>

236
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Braavosi does the deed.</font>

237
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for each of us, darling.</font>

238
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">No peeking.</font>

239
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

240
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow my voice. I'm right here.</font>

241
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have something for me?</font>

242
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Morghulis.</font>

243
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa.</font>

244
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look very handsome, my lord.</font>

245
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes.</font>

246
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The husband of your dreams.
But you do look glorious.</font>

247
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we could
have a moment alone. Do you mind?</font>

248
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?</font>

249
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, I want you to know</font>

250
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask for this.</font>

251
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.</font>

252
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't.</font>

253
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to
speak to me as a prisoner anymore.</font>

254
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't be
a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife.</font>

255
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.</font>

256
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to say...</font>

257
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to say, very badly...</font>

258
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just...</font>

259
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just want to say I know how you feel.</font>

260
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt that very much, my lord.</font>

261
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. I have no idea how you feel.</font>

262
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you have no idea how I feel.</font>

263
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:05,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I promise you
one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you.</font>

264
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you drink wine?</font>

265
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I have to.</font>

266
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, today you have to.</font>

267
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look radiant, Your Grace.</font>

268
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radiant? Why radiant?</font>

269
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the word that came to mind.</font>

270
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to
be sisters soon. We should be friends.</font>

271
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a musical girl, aren't you?</font>

272
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine you have a lovely voice.</font>

273
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.</font>

274
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know the song
The Rains of Castamere?</font>

275
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. They play it
so often here at court.</font>

276
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?</font>

277
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as well as you, I'm sure.</font>

278
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">House Reyne was
a powerful family. Very wealthy.</font>

279
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second wealthiest in Westeros.</font>

280
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?</font>

281
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambitious climbers don't want to
stop on the second highest rung.</font>

282
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only you could take that final step,</font>

283
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd see further than all the rest.</font>

284
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.</font>

285
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Lord Reyne built a castle
as grand as Casterly Rock.</font>

286
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave his wife diamonds
larger than any my mother ever wore.</font>

287
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And finally one day,
he rebelled against my father.</font>

288
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where House Reyne is now?</font>

289
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gone.</font>

290
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gone.</font>

291
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gentle word. Why not say "slaughtered"?</font>

292
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man, woman, and
child put to the sword.</font>

293
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember seeing their bodies hanging</font>

294
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">high above the gates of Casterly Rock.</font>

295
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:03,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father let them rot up there all summer.
It was a long summer.</font>

296
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:09,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And now the rains weep o'er their
halls, and not a soul to hear."</font>

297
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you ever call me "sister" again,</font>

298
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have you strangled in your sleep.</font>

299
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

300
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father's gone.</font>

301
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the father of the realm, it is my duty</font>

302
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give you away to your husband.</font>

303
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may now cloak the bride and
bring her under your protection.</font>

304
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

305
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you...</font>

306
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

307
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, Your Grace,
my lords, my ladies,</font>

308
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">we stand here in the sight of gods and men</font>

309
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">to witness the union of man and wife.</font>

310
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">One flesh,
one heart, one soul, now and forever.</font>

311
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever seen one like it?</font>

312
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen
anything like any of this. Not in my life.</font>

313
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's shocking, isn't it,
the first time you encounter real wealth?</font>

314
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.</font>

315
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">And stew is a kind word for it.</font>

316
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Flea Bottom
we called them "bowls of brown."</font>

317
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd pretend that
the meat in them was chicken.</font>

318
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We knew it wasn't chicken.</font>

319
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, taste this.</font>

320
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm trying to poison you?</font>

321
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

322
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's really good.</font>

323
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think it's from?</font>

324
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't even guess.</font>

325
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter, does it?
It's the real thing or it's not.</font>

326
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.</font>

327
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, have some more.</font>

328
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still don't trust it.</font>

329
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think this is all a mistake</font>

330
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that you have to pay
for every bite you take.</font>

331
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.</font>

332
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no mistakes.</font>

333
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for us.</font>

334
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a mistake.</font>

335
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother</font>

336
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of the girl next
to her in the tavern.</font>

337
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:51,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father chose your
mother because the Lord of Light willed it.</font>

338
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">He willed it so you could be here right now</font>

339
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a power inside you
you can't even begin to understand.</font>

340
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">And He brought me here to draw it
from you and birth it into the world.</font>

341
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're both a part of His plan.</font>

342
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.</font>

343
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand. This...</font>

344
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't seem very religious.</font>

345
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to whom?</font>

346
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Silent Sisters?</font>

347
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">With their stern looks,
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?</font>

348
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have their gods done for you?</font>

349
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm?</font>

350
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you pray to them, what's their answer?</font>

351
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">A god is real or he's not.</font>

352
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only need eyes to see.</font>

353
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death is coming for
everyone and everything.</font>

354
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">A darkness that will swallow the dawn.</font>

355
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can stop it, you and I.</font>

356
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you what you have inside you.</font>

357
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come fight death with me.</font>

358
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

359
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to trust me.</font>

360
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...</font>

361
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it away.</font>

362
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it off me.</font>

363
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.</font>

364
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing this?</font>

365
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.</font>

366
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you have so much blood.</font>

367
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

368
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no!</font>

369
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not there. Not there!</font>

370
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't
believe in the power of king's blood.</font>

371
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted a demonstration.</font>

372
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please, Your Grace.</font>

373
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord!</font>

374
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">The usurper Robb Stark.</font>

375
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">The usurper Balon Greyjoy.</font>

376
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.</font>

377
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">So their son will be your nephew.</font>

378
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you're wed to Cersei, of course.</font>

379
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will be
the King's stepfather and brother-in-law.</font>

380
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you marry the King, Jeffrey's
mother will become his sister-in-law</font>

381
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your son will be Loras' nephew?</font>

382
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandson? I'm not sure.</font>

383
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your brother
will become your father-in-law.</font>

384
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">That much is beyond dispute.</font>

385
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you pardon me, my lord?</font>

386
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Of course. Enjoy.</font>

387
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you could
talk to your bride-to-be instead.</font>

388
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a lifetime for that.</font>

389
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem rather drunk.</font>

390
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rather less than I plan to be.</font>

391
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?</font>

392
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't about your
wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding.</font>

393
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:24,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wife needs a child,
a Lannister child, as soon as possible.</font>

394
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

395
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're going to give her one,</font>

396
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to perform.</font>

397
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you once call me?</font>

398
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drunken little lust-filled beast.</font>

399
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- More than once.
- There you have it.</font>

400
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing to worry about.</font>

401
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drinking and lust,
no man can match me in these things.</font>

402
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the god of tits and wine.</font>

403
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:52,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall build a shrine
to myself at the next brothel I visit.</font>

404
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can drink, you can joke,</font>

405
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can engage in juvenile attempts</font>

406
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make your father uncomfortable,</font>

407
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you will do your duty.</font>

408
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

409
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father once told me...</font>

410
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares what your
father once told you.</font>

411
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, my lady.</font>

412
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Your Grace.</font>

413
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.</font>

414
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.</font>

415
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?</font>

416
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a glorious day.</font>

417
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace.</font>

418
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it doesn't really matter</font>

419
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">which Lannister puts the baby into you.</font>

420
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight
after my uncle passes out.</font>

421
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you like that?</font>

422
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't?</font>

423
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all right.
Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.</font>

424
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time for the bedding ceremony.</font>

425
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

426
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be no bedding ceremony.</font>

427
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?</font>

428
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, everyone. Pick her up and
carry her to her wedding bed.</font>

429
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing it any longer.</font>

430
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.</font>

431
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be no bedding ceremony.</font>

432
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be if I command it.</font>

433
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:24,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll be
fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.</font>

434
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

435
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

436
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we can
dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.</font>

437
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the King.</font>

438
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bad joke, Your Grace.</font>

439
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.</font>

440
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine is so small.</font>

441
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">My poor wife won't even know I'm there.</font>

442
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.</font>

443
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

444
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilty.</font>

445
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

446
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is my wedding night.</font>

447
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.</font>

448
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, wife.</font>

449
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.</font>

450
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not proud of it.</font>

451
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think honesty is important</font>

452
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">between a man and wife, don't you agree?</font>

453
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, I'll tell you
all about it. Put you in the mood.</font>

454
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that wise, my lord?</font>

455
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion, Sansa.</font>

456
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Tyrion.</font>

457
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that wise, Tyrion?</font>

458
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing was ever wiser.</font>

459
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Astoundingly long.</font>

460
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

461
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neck.</font>

462
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one.</font>

463
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old are you exactly?</font>

464
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">14.</font>

465
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, talk won't make you any older.</font>

466
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:26,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord father has
commanded me to consummate this marriage.</font>

467
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

468
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

469
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could, I won't.</font>

470
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your father...</font>

471
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:02,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my father wants someone to get
fucked, I know where he can start.</font>

472
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't share your bed.</font>

473
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until you want me to.</font>

474
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I never want you to?</font>

475
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so my watch begins.</font>

476
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nineteen?</font>

477
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace.</font>

478
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can anyone speak 19 languages?</font>

479
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">It only took Your Grace
a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.</font>

480
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki</font>

481
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">or grunt at my husband and hope...</font>

482
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, "reasonably well"?</font>

483
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dothraki is difficult for
the mouth to master.</font>

484
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So guttural and harsh.</font>

485
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drogo said I spoke Dothraki
like one born to it.</font>

486
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It gave him great pride.</font>

487
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athjahakar.</font>

488
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athjahaka.</font>

489
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ath-ja-hakar.</font>

490
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Athjahakar.</font>

491
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.</font>

492
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your High Valyrian is
very good, Your Grace.</font>

493
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.</font>

494
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the only proper language for poetry.</font>

495
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">No screaming, or she dies.</font>

496
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

497
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

498
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her go.</font>

499
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't scream, lovely girl.</font>

500
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were sent here to kill me?</font>

501
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why haven't you?</font>

502
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to.</font>

503
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do your captains
have to say about that?</font>

504
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should ask them.</font>

505
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:22,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

506
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had philosophical differences.</font>

507
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over what?</font>

508
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your beauty.</font>

509
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">It meant more to me than it did to them.</font>

510
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a strange man.</font>

511
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.
I only do what I want to do.</font>

512
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is supposed to impress me?</font>

513
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

514
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?</font>

515
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">They ordered me to murder you.</font>

516
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them I preferred not to.</font>

517
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">They told me I had no choice.</font>

518
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them I am Daario Naharis.
I always have a choice.</font>

519
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">They drew their swords and I drew mine.</font>

520
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you fight for me?</font>

521
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear to me.</font>

522
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Second Sons are yours,
and so is Daario Naharis.</font>

523
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:56,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sword is yours,
my life is yours, my heart is yours.</font>

524
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really ought to knock.</font>

525
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought your breakfast.</font>

526
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:41,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting dark.
We could stay here for the night.</font>

527
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">How hard can it be to build a fire?</font>

528
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:22,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter. Come under the
furs. We can keep each other warm.</font>

529
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">He winked at me before.</font>

530
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt it.</font>

531
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him wink at me.</font>

532
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">He blinked.</font>

533
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference</font>

534
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">between a wink and a blink.</font>

535
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">A what?</font>

536
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:03,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, there's no real difference.</font>

537
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wink is on purpose.</font>

538
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought of a name yet?</font>

539
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be easier
to refer to him if he had a name.</font>

540
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?</font>

541
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

542
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just the way I talk.</font>

543
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll build that fire.</font>

544
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think he should have a name?</font>

545
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know many boys' names.</font>

546
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see, there's Duncan,</font>

547
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kevan, Jon...</font>

548
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.</font>

549
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster.</font>

550
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Yes.</font>

551
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that's not...</font>

552
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mormont.</font>

553
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lovely idea,
but Mormont's a last name.</font>

554
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it a last name?</font>

555
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's a family name.</font>

556
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.</font>

557
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:29,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell is my birth name
and Tarly is my family name.</font>

558
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? So my father is also a Tarly.</font>

559
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Samwell Tarly, too?</font>

560
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Randyll Tarly.</font>

561
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randyll is a handsome name.</font>

562
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't name him Randyll.</font>

563
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your father cruel, like mine?</font>

564
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Different manner of cruel.</font>

565
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not Randyll, then.</font>

566
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't.</font>

567
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go out there.</font>

568
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be back. I just want to look.</font>

569
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go inside.</font>

570
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back inside. I'll...</font>

571
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's come for the baby.</font>

572
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:57,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back!</font>

573
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay back!</font>

574
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't have him! No!</font>

575
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>
