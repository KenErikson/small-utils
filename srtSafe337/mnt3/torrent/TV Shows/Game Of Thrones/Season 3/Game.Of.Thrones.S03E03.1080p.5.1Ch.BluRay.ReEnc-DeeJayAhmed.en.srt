00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I may, nephew,</font>

2
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants</font>

3
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...</font>

4
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?</font>

5
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't call him
"nephew." He is your king.</font>

6
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb knows I meant him no...</font>

7
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky I'm not your king.</font>

8
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.</font>

9
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog</font>

10
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.</font>

11
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war</font>

12
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he's the only one winning any battles.</font>

13
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there's glory enough to go around.</font>

14
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not about glory.</font>

15
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.</font>

16
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seized an opportunity.</font>

17
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">What value was the mill?</font>

18
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.</font>

19
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he there now?</font>

20
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.</font>

21
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to draw the
Mountain into the west,</font>

22
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.</font>

23
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted him to chase us,</font>

24
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">which he would have done
because he is a mad dog</font>

25
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">without a strategic thought in his head.</font>

26
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have that head on a spike by now.</font>

27
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, I have a mill.</font>

28
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.</font>

29
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.</font>

30
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Martyn is 15, I believe.</font>

31
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tywin Lannister has my sisters.</font>

32
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I sued for peace?</font>

33
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

34
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's</font>

35
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">brother's great-grandsons?</font>

36
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

37
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men did you lose?</font>

38
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">208. But for every man we
lost, the Lannisters...</font>

39
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need our men more than Tywin needs his!</font>

40
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

41
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know.</font>

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have.</font>

43
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:20,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.</font>

44
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">We seem to be running
short of patience here.</font>

45
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who isn't?</font>

46
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tywin Lannister.</font>

47
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intimate. Lovely table.</font>

48
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better chairs than
the old Small Council chamber.</font>

49
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.</font>

50
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">What news of Jaime?</font>

51
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">20,000 unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.</font>

52
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You control more spies and informants</font>

53
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">than the rest of the world combined.</font>

54
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?</font>

55
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are trying, my lord.</font>

56
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try harder.</font>

57
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we have, then?</font>

58
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun</font>

59
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.</font>

60
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Stark's absence,
Rouse Bolton holds Harrenhal,</font>

61
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,</font>

62
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">in practice, not in name.</font>

63
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him have it.</font>

64
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:18,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.</font>

65
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Harrenhal will make</font>

66
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.</font>

67
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.</font>

68
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.</font>

69
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.</font>

70
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">A successful courtship would make</font>

71
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.</font>

72
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Titles do seem to breed titles.</font>

73
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible</font>

74
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.</font>

75
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the young wolf can add his own aunt</font>

76
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.</font>

77
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Far be it from me to hinder true love,</font>

78
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.</font>

79
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">The royal wedding may end up being</font>

80
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most expensive event in living memory.</font>

81
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.</font>

82
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a good time
to leave the crown's finances unattended.</font>

83
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fully agreed.</font>

84
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.</font>

85
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Master of Coin?</font>

86
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would appear to best suits your talents.</font>

87
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite good at spending money,</font>

88
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a lifetime of outrageous wealth</font>

89
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">hasn't taught me much about managing it.</font>

90
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.</font>

91
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear, hear.</font>

92
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lifted her high in the air</font>

93
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sniffed and roared and smelled her there</font>

94
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair</font>

95
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he licked the honey from her hair</font>

96
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">From there to here, from here to there</font>

97
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">All black and brown and covered with hair</font>

98
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">He smelled that girl on the summer air</font>

99
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair</font>

100
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:56,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're pleased. If I were
armed, they'd never have taken us.</font>

101
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were armed
when we were taken.</font>

102
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in chains, if you recall.</font>

103
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.</font>

104
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,</font>

105
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">"what a brilliant swordsman."</font>

106
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.</font>

107
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been sitting in a muddy pen,</font>

108
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">wrapped in chains, for the past year.</font>

109
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a woman. I was beating you.</font>

110
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were not beating me.</font>

111
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you were as good as people said...</font>

112
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once.</font>

113
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.</font>

114
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.</font>

115
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.</font>

116
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?</font>

117
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll knock your teeth out.</font>

118
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I care?</font>

119
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.</font>

120
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you fight them,
they will kill you' Do you understand?</font>

121
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the prisoner of value, not you.</font>

122
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?</font>

123
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it matter?</font>

124
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes.</font>

125
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretend they're Renly.</font>

126
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?</font>

127
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd let them do what they wanted?</font>

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.</font>

129
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.</font>

130
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has
to keep the arrows out of my heart.</font>

131
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you helping him?</font>

132
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?</font>

133
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not our prisoner.</font>

134
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I?</font>

135
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our guest.</font>

136
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's put any chains on you.</font>

137
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can walk away, then?</font>

138
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky we found you.</font>

140
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think
you're good with that bow, you little twat?</font>

141
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than anyone you've met.</font>

142
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cowards weapon.
I like to fight up close,</font>

143
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.</font>

144
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? So you can kiss him?</font>

145
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember the last time you were here?</font>

146
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.</font>

147
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker</font>

148
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd rather not see you no more.</font>

149
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch your head.</font>

150
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Off we go.</font>

151
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk up!</font>

152
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? We're about to leave.</font>

153
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm staying.</font>

154
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're what?</font>

155
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I baked brown bread for the innkeep,
she said she never had better.</font>

156
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told Thoros she's keeping me as
payment for all his free meals.</font>

157
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood
wants. My brother ain't no king.</font>

158
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.</font>

159
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winterfell.</font>

160
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sure?
- I'm sure.</font>

161
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I made you something.</font>

162
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

163
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a wolf.</font>

164
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the tail?</font>

166
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

167
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, be safe.</font>

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.</font>

169
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't burn your fingers.</font>

170
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, Hot Pie.</font>

171
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, Arry.</font>

172
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up you go, little lady.</font>

173
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Hot Pie.</font>

174
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really good.</font>

175
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.</font>

176
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">It often comforts me
to think that even in war's darkest days,</font>

177
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:40,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">in most places in
the world absolutely nothing is happening.</font>

178
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've missed you, Uncle.</font>

179
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father missed you, too,
from the day you left.</font>

180
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he never said it in so many words...</font>

181
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe?</font>

182
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father was a stubborn old ox.</font>

183
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was surprised when he died. Didn't
think death had the patience.</font>

184
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.</font>

185
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you make peace in the end?</font>

186
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:17,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">After 30 years of fighting, I don't
think he remembered what started it.</font>

187
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.</font>

188
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.</font>

189
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,</font>

190
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't remember my real name.</font>

191
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time he would leave for the
capital or fight in a campaign,</font>

192
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd see him off.</font>

193
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.</font>

194
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."</font>

195
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:59,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.</font>

196
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder,</font>

197
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">how many times did Bran or Rickon</font>

198
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">stare across the moors of Winterfell,</font>

199
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting for me to return?</font>

200
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will never see them again.</font>

201
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mustn't think it.</font>

202
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.</font>

203
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb believes they're alive.</font>

204
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he must go on believing.</font>

205
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.</font>

206
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you must remain strong for him.</font>

207
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Robb Stark's wife.</font>

208
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold still.</font>

209
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true what they say about him?</font>

210
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. What do they say about him?</font>

211
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">That he can turn into a wolf at night.</font>

212
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">True.</font>

213
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he eats the flesh of his enemies.</font>

214
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">True.</font>

215
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Lannister, aren't you?</font>

216
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Martyn Lannister.</font>

217
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.</font>

218
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless it's a full moon.</font>

219
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a full moon tonight, is it?</font>

220
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? Nothing to fear.</font>

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always the artists.</font>

222
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only horses.</font>

223
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">No men.</font>

224
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said there was dead crows.</font>

225
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was.</font>

226
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men were here?</font>

227
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">About 300.</font>

228
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what those men are now?</font>

229
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.</font>

230
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think anyone got away?</font>

231
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.</font>

232
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:54,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.</font>

233
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he lost.</font>

234
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">His best fighting men are dead.</font>

235
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whether
he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</font>

236
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a blue-eyed corpse,</font>

237
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's a long way from home.</font>

238
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tormund. Climb the Wall.</font>

239
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.</font>

240
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows Castle
Black's defenses better than any of us.</font>

241
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he's useful,
good. If not, throw him off the Wall.</font>

242
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">See if crows can fly.</font>

243
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're finally going to war, old friend?</font>

244
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hide near Castle Black. When I give
the signal, hit them in the night.</font>

245
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got a big old wall to hide
behind, but it only guards one side.</font>

246
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll meet again.</font>

247
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aye. If you do your job.
- Ah.</font>

248
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will we see your signal?</font>

249
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send your eagle
above the Wall every night.</font>

250
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire</font>

251
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">the North has ever seen.</font>

252
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost?</font>

253
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have we here? Frozen crows?</font>

254
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come a long way.</font>

255
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smaller flock
than you went north with.</font>

256
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can talk inside.</font>

257
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, can we?</font>

258
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need some water.
Tether it, and I'll be inside.</font>

259
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your eyes where they belong.</font>

260
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not for you.</font>

261
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.</font>

262
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, pig's got value to me.</font>

263
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should all
be kissing my feet for letting you in.</font>

264
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.</font>

265
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a godly man?</font>

266
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am. I got no fear of what's out there.</font>

267
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the white cold comes,</font>

268
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.</font>

269
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only ones left
will be those who are right with the Gods.</font>

270
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real Gods.</font>

271
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go tell her she can bite down on a rag</font>

272
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">or she can bite down on my fist.</font>

273
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women.</font>

274
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sow right
there gave birth to a litter of eight.</font>

275
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barely a grunt.</font>

276
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's almost as fat as this one here.</font>

277
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now why don't you dine on him?</font>

278
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carve off what you need as you go.</font>

279
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.</font>

280
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:07,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya?</font>

281
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see the head. Push. That's it.</font>

282
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're nearly there.</font>

283
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more push should do it.</font>

284
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it? What is it?</font>

285
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep quiet.</font>

286
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.</font>

287
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can ride.</font>

288
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure?</font>

289
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:19,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ride east. Follow the rising sun.
Your sisters waiting for you.</font>

290
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make you
a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.</font>

291
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not in the Iron Islands.</font>

292
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

293
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

294
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on, Come on. Come on.</font>

295
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on back.</font>

296
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You refuse to
tell me where you're going?</font>

297
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.</font>

298
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long will you be gone?</font>

299
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

300
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're abandoning me.</font>

301
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will never abandon you.</font>

302
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the Son of Fire.</font>

303
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sworn to serve you.</font>

304
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then serve me.</font>

305
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I return, you will understand.</font>

306
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">My enemies think they've destroyed me.</font>

307
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:11,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're laughing at me,
the way Renly laughed at me.</font>

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want Joffrey dead. I
want Robb Stark dead.</font>

309
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me another son.</font>

310
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot.</font>

311
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

312
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.</font>

313
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not easily killed. Men
have tried for years.</font>

314
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you.</font>

315
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your fires burn low, my king.</font>

316
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is another way. A better way.</font>

317
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.</font>

318
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.</font>

319
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

320
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are others
with your blood in their veins.</font>

321
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will sit on the Iron Throne,</font>

322
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">but first there must be sacrifices.</font>

323
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Light demands it.</font>

324
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.</font>

325
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">To whom?</font>

326
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">To any slave who contemplates doing</font>

327
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever these slaves did.</font>

328
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your water.</font>

329
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.</font>

330
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here' drink.</font>

331
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave this place, Your Grace.</font>

332
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave tonight, I beg you.</font>

333
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is she to do for soldiers?</font>

334
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.</font>

335
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?</font>

336
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to sit on the throne</font>

337
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">your ancestors built, you must win it.</font>

338
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.</font>

339
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.</font>

340
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?</font>

341
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war</font>

342
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">where innocents didn't
die by the thousands?</font>

343
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in King's Landing
after the sack, Khaleesi.</font>

344
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I saw? Butchery.</font>

345
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Babies, children, old men.</font>

346
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">More women raped than you can count.</font>

347
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a beast in every man, and it
stirs when you put a sword in his hand.</font>

348
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.</font>

349
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.</font>

350
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.</font>

351
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You disagree, Ser Barristan?</font>

352
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,</font>

353
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">men died for him
because they believed in him,</font>

354
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they loved him,</font>

355
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">not because they'd been
bought at an auction.</font>

356
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought beside the last
dragon on that day.</font>

357
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bled beside him.</font>

358
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,</font>

359
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Rhaegar died.</font>

360
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?</font>

361
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.</font>

362
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.</font>

363
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">All?
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?</font>

364
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did not. I want to buy them all.</font>

365
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants to buy them all.</font>

366
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't afford them.</font>

367
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">The slut thinks she can flash her tits,</font>

368
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make us give her whatever she wants.</font>

369
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?</font>

370
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:22,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. 8,000.
And the ones still in training as well.</font>

371
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they fail on the battlefield,</font>

372
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will shame Astapor.</font>

373
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master Greizhen says
they cannot sell half-trained boys.</font>

374
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they fail on the battlefield,</font>

375
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.</font>

376
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have them all or take none.</font>

377
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many will fall in battle.
I'll need the boys</font>

378
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pick up the swords they drop.</font>

379
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">The slut cannot pay for all of this.</font>

380
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:53,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.</font>

381
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:56,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her ship will buy her
100 Unsullied, no more,</font>

382
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.</font>

383
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this because I like
the curve of her ass.</font>

384
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Master Kraznys is generous.</font>

385
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is left will buy her 10.</font>

386
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gold
you have left is worth 10.</font>

387
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give her 20
if it stops her ignorant whimpering.</font>

388
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.</font>

389
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her Dothraki smell of shit,</font>

390
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki you have with you...</font>

391
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">but may be useful as pig feed.</font>

392
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki you have
are not worth what they cost to feed...</font>

393
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give her 3 for those.</font>

394
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:27,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Master
Kraznys will give you</font>

395
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">three Unsullied for all of them.</font>

396
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, ask this beggar queen,</font>

397
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay...</font>

398
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">how will she pay
for the remaining 7,877?</font>

399
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:39,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">for
the remaining 7,877 Unsullied?</font>

400
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have dragons. I'll give you one.</font>

401
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:54,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will win the throne with
dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.</font>

402
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi, please.</font>

403
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three dragons.</font>

404
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One.
- Two.</font>

405
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

406
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want the biggest one.</font>

407
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.</font>

408
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take you as well, now.</font>

409
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.</font>

410
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">A token of a bargain well struck.</font>

411
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asks that you give me
to her, as a present.</font>

412
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asks that you do this now.</font>

413
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more</font>

414
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that.</font>

415
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're both here to advise me.</font>

416
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I value your advice, but if you ever</font>

417
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">question me in front of strangers again,</font>

418
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll be advising someone else.</font>

419
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that understood?</font>

420
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a name?</font>

421
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.</font>

422
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a family? A mother and a father</font>

423
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd return to if you had the choice?</font>

424
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Your Grace. No family living.</font>

425
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.</font>

426
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.</font>

427
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many of those on the Walk of
Punishment were taken there for less.</font>

428
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offered water to
a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.</font>

429
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."</font>

430
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.</font>

431
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true what Master Kraznys told me</font>

432
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the Unsullied? About their obedience?</font>

433
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">All questions have been taken from them.
They obey, that is all.</font>

434
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once they are yours, they are yours.</font>

435
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will fall on their swords
if you command it.</font>

436
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.</font>

437
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may go hungry. You may fall sick.</font>

438
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may be killed.</font>

439
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Morghulis.</font>

440
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, all men must die.</font>

441
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are not men.</font>

442
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.</font>

443
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised you're surprised.</font>

444
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the safest place in the city.</font>

445
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for bastards.</font>

446
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all of them, my lord.</font>

447
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my dear. Pod.</font>

448
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod. Take them outside.</font>

449
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be there in a moment.</font>

450
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

451
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.</font>

452
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.</font>

453
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have him knighted.</font>

454
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only the Master of Coin had such power.</font>

455
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only.</font>

456
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you a significant debt.</font>

457
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our redheaded friend.</font>

458
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You secured her release
when the Queen detained her.</font>

459
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that.</font>

460
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. A simple misunderstanding.</font>

461
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, Her Grace believed</font>

462
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you two had
some sort of special relationship.</font>

463
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't. I did fuck her once.</font>

464
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- But we don't.</font>

465
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

466
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's! the Queen get that idea?</font>

467
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you ask her?</font>

468
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any advice for me on my new position?</font>

469
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep a low profile.</font>

470
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had a gold dragon</font>

471
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">for every time I heard that joke,
I'd be richer than you are.</font>

472
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are richer than I am.</font>

473
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good point.</font>

474
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.</font>

475
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:10,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.</font>

476
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:15,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.</font>

477
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:20,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.</font>

478
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'm here later. Come on.</font>

479
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, then.</font>

480
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like dull reading.</font>

481
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think all
reading is dull reading.</font>

482
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.</font>

483
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">The secret history
of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.</font>

484
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers</font>

485
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hide what he's really up to.</font>

486
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless he made it all up, yes.</font>

487
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Podrick, do keep up.</font>

488
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

489
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod rick.</font>

490
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:54,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord?</font>

491
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,</font>

492
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finally found
a suitable reward for the services</font>

493
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.</font>

494
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Pod,
have you ever been with a woman?</font>

495
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord.</font>

496
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful.</font>

497
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Genna specializes in first-timers.</font>

498
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not bad with second-timers, either.</font>

499
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, my lord...</font>

500
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear</font>

501
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?</font>

502
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, as it happens,</font>

503
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marei</font>

504
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">is quite the spear-handler herself.</font>

505
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's here to thank you
for staying by my side</font>

506
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">as the battle raged all around me.</font>

507
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's handsome.</font>

508
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell me he was handsome.</font>

509
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:55,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kayla is famous
from hereto Volantis in certain circles.</font>

510
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper Meereenese Knot.</font>

511
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, I don't even...</font>

512
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's here to thank you for
being a thoroughly respectful fellow,</font>

513
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."</font>

514
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be back in time for my supper.</font>

515
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pace yourself, lad.</font>

516
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">For years
I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.</font>

517
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together</font>

518
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, poof, mountains of gold.</font>

519
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess. He's not a magician.</font>

520
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

521
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's stealing it?</font>

522
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worse, he's borrowing it.</font>

523
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with that?</font>

524
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't afford to pay it back'
that's what's wrong with it.</font>

525
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crown owes millions to my father.</font>

526
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,</font>

527
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine he'll forgive that debt.</font>

528
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive a debt, my father?</font>

529
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive,</font>

530
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never borrowed money.</font>

531
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not clear on the rules.
- Well...</font>

532
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">The basic principle is, I lend you money,</font>

533
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">and after an agreed upon period of
time, you return it with interest.</font>

534
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I don't?</font>

535
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have to.</font>

536
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if I don't?</font>

537
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why I don't lend you money.</font>

538
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, it's not my
father I'm worried about.</font>

539
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.</font>

540
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We owe them tens of millions.</font>

541
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we fail to repay these loans,</font>

542
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bank will fund our enemies.</font>

543
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">One way or another,
they always get their gold back.</font>

544
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the return of the conquering hero.</font>

545
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he have a little jaunt in his step?</font>

546
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lad's practically skipping.</font>

547
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.</font>

548
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I say my money's worth?</font>

549
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:04,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.</font>

550
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a squire. You don't pay him.</font>

551
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.</font>

552
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wouldn't take it, my lord.</font>

553
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they're trying to curry some
favor with the new Master of Coin.</font>

554
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?</font>

555
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.</font>

556
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you tell them?</font>

557
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't tell them anything.</font>

558
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do to them?</font>

559
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of things.</font>

560
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they seemed to like these things?</font>

561
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

562
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course they did.
They're paid to seem to like it.</font>

563
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only they weren't paid.</font>

564
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,</font>

565
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">they gave him the time for free?</font>

566
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you're telling us?</font>

567
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, Podrick.</font>

568
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to need details.</font>

569
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copious details.</font>

570
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Come on!</font>

571
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:50,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Come on.</font>

572
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how we deal with runaways?</font>

573
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off his pants.</font>

574
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No, no, no!</font>

575
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna fuck you into the din.</font>

576
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!</font>

577
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please! No! No!</font>

578
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little bastard.</font>

579
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, my lord.</font>

580
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a long way from home,
and winter is coming.</font>

581
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take the big bitch first.</font>

582
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:06,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she's good
and wet, you lot can finish her off.</font>

583
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.</font>

584
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me</font>

585
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.</font>

586
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.</font>

587
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orders were to take the Kingslayer
alive. Nobody said shit about you.</font>

588
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're only making it worse.</font>

589
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:35,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take her over there,
where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.</font>

590
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

591
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who she is, don't you?</font>

592
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">A big dumb bitch from who cares where.</font>

593
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never been with a woman that big.</font>

594
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's Brienne of Tarth.</font>

595
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her father is
Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?</font>

596
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna cut your throat!</font>

597
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:15,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call it
the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?</font>

598
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:19,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every sapphire in Westerns
was mined on Tarth.</font>

599
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sapphires are gemstones.</font>

600
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blue ones.</font>

601
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what they are.</font>

602
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight</font>

603
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">in sapphires if she's returned to him.</font>

604
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:39,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">But only if she's alive,
her honor unbesmirched.</font>

605
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring her back here.</font>

606
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

607
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

608
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:55,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

609
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, on your feet.</font>

610
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbesmirched.</font>

611
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not defiled.</font>

612
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fancy word for a fancy man.</font>

613
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated to read as a child,</font>

614
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:15,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my father forced me
to study every morning</font>

615
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I could practice
with sword or horse.</font>

616
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two hours every day
holed up in the maester's chambers.</font>

617
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned a lot of fancy words.</font>

618
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you did.</font>

619
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:40,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father, he'd pay your
weight in gold to get you back?</font>

620
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be a rich man till
the end of your days.</font>

621
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:49,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your sons will be rich men,
and their sons after them.</font>

622
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lands, titles...</font>

623
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have them all.</font>

624
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">The North can't win this war.</font>

625
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a smart man. You understand that.</font>

626
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have the numbers. We have the gold.</font>

627
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, you have both.</font>

628
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.</font>

629
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:16,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.</font>

630
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard to argue with that.</font>

631
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we're speaking
together man to man,</font>

632
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?</font>

633
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,</font>

634
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if I could sleep lying down,</font>

635
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">my back would thank you for it.</font>

636
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not as young and
resilient as I was once.</font>

637
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us are.</font>

638
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.</font>

639
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, men.</font>

640
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.</font>

641
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm famished, actually.</font>

642
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we've got a spare
partridge on the fire.</font>

643
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do like partridge.</font>

644
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:17,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.</font>

645
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will this work as a table, my lord?</font>

646
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...</font>

647
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the stump.</font>

648
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're the smartest man there is.</font>

649
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:46,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.</font>

650
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father...</font>

651
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:48,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you get in any trouble,</font>

652
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">all you've got to do is say "my father"</font>

653
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's it, all your troubles are gone.</font>

654
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't.</font>

655
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you got something to say?</font>

656
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.</font>

657
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:15,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.</font>

658
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never forget that.</font>

659
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, this should help you remember.</font>
