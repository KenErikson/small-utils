<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Always in confidence.</font>

21
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">About the events of the Backwater.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I'm coming to you.
I need proof.</font>

30
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proof? Will there be a trial?</font>

31
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know.</font>

32
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no proof, only whispers.</font>

33
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before all this nastiness,</font>

34
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.</font>

35
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to hear it still?</font>

36
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Do I?</font>

37
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:42,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of
actors through the Free Cities</font>

38
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day in Myr,</font>

39
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse</font>

40
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feared the man meant to use me</font>

41
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">as I'd heard some men used small boys.</font>

42
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what he wanted was far worse.</font>

43
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,</font>

44
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">yet did nothing to dull my senses.</font>

45
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a hooked blade he sliced me,</font>

46
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">root and stem. Chanting all the while.</font>

47
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">He burned my parts in a brazier.</font>

48
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flames turned We
and I heard a voice answer has call.</font>

49
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still dream of that night.</font>

50
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.</font>

51
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dream of the voice from the flames.</font>

52
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?</font>

53
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

54
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.</font>

55
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ever since that day, I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.</font>

56
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can see why I was
eager to aid in your</font>

57
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">fight against Stannis
and his red priestess.</font>

58
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">A symbolic revenge of sons.</font>

59
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

60
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel the need for actual revenge against</font>

61
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">the actual person who
tried to have me killed,</font>

62
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">which will require
a degree of influence, which...</font>

63
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not possess at the moment.</font>

64
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:22,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">But influence is
largely a matter of patience, I have found.</font>

65
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,</font>

66
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">he threw me out of his house to die.</font>

67
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I resolved to live to spite him.</font>

68
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I begged.</font>

69
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sold what pans of my body remained to me.</font>

70
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I became an excellent thief,</font>

71
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters</font>

72
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">are more valuable
than the contents of ms purse</font>

73
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:52,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step by step.
one distasteful task after another,</font>

74
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:58,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made my way from the shims of Myr
to the Small Council chamber</font>

75
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Influence grows like a weed.</font>

76
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tended mine patiently</font>

77
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">until its tendrils reached
from the Red Keep</font>

78
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the way across to the
far side of the world,</font>

79
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I managed
to wrap them around something very special</font>

80
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

81
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sorcerer.</font>

82
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello' my old friend.</font>

83
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a long time.</font>

84
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:39,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no doubt
the revenge you want will be yours in time,</font>

85
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you have the stomach for it.</font>

86
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">When people talk about the Night's Watch,</font>

87
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">they never mention the shoveling.</font>

88
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the shit.</font>

89
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tell you about honor,</font>

90
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">pardoning crimes, and protecting the ream,</font>

91
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">but shoveling really is most of it.</font>

92
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">And getting attacked or killed or worse.</font>

93
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that.</font>

94
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when you're not getting attacked or
killed, usually you're shoveling.</font>

95
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, look. More shit.</font>

96
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:18,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was starting to wonder
what to do with the rest of me day.</font>

97
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get out of here.</font>

98
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Lord Commander
says we go we go.</font>

99
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord Commander
told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that turn out for us?</font>

101
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had no way of knowing.</font>

102
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do now. We know what's out there.</font>

103
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster's been out here surviving.</font>

104
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's your
new protector now? Our good friend Craster?</font>

105
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like the sons he never had.</font>

serve us up like so many pigs.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">If we want to live,</font>

110
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll have to look out for ourselves.</font>

111
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You woke him.</font>

112
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

113
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,060

114
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's beautiful.</font>

115
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does he have a name?
- No</font>

116
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to give mm one?</font>

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

118
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here.
- Gilly.</font>

119
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said to hold it for you

120
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it</font>

121

00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time for you.</font>

125
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time for anyone but him</font>

126
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he doesn't have much time.</font>

127
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to go after him.</font>

128
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

129
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how.</font>

132
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,895

133
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother, I need to find it.
It's here. It's calling me.</font>

134
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,830

No more climbing. Promise me.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me!</font>

139
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he very large?</font>

140
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">No larger than usual, apparently.</font>

141
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet, they said that he was...</font>

142
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extraordinary.</font>

143
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most extraordinary man they've ever
had. And they've had a lot of men.</font>

144

<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking about the same Podrick?</font>

145

<font color="#FFFFFF">The quiet boy in
Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?</font>

146
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,477

147
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, my lord.</font>

148
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls are usually quite descriptive.</font>

149
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what did they say?</font>

150
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said it was hard to describe.</font>

151
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

152
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.</font>

00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did
Littlefinger say about this loss of income?</font>

154
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was too preoccupied to notice.</font>

155
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.</font>

156
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm helping him prepare for his journey.</font>

157
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the</font>

158
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Arryn and the title
that comes with her.</font>

159
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sad, really.</font>

160
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that all it takes to make our friend</font>

161
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lose interest m poor Sansa Stark?</font>

162
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.</font>

163
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

164
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't think he's lost interest.</font>

165
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you say so?</font>

166
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">His shipboard inventory.</font>

167
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can read
Rare for a woman in your profession</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Former profession.
- Of course</font>

169
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?</font>

170
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two featherbeds.</font>

171
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.</font>

172
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is important enough to Littlefinger</font>

173
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">to merit a featherbed,
besides Littlefinger?</font>

174
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could he be bringing one of his girls?</font>

175
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not interested in them, my lord.</font>

176
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

177
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm one of his girls.</font>

178
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prodigies in odd maces indeed.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered</font>

180
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">by her brother or rather his dragon.</font>

181
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ate her while her son watched.</font>

182
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's left of her is
buried in the crypts right down there.</font>

183
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ceremony
is traditionally held in the main sanctum,</font>

184
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">which seats 700 comfortably.</font>

185
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">There appears
to be a good deal of room elsewhere</font>

186
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the premises for everyone else.</font>

187
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't
more than 700 people of any importance.</font>

188
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">No the rest are there
to look adoringly upon the 700</font>

189
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:58,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">to remind them how superior they
must be to have the best seats.</font>

190
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.</font>

191
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aerion Brightflame, they called him.</font>

192
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.</font>

193
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was wrong.</font>

194
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:15,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, of course,
there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.</font>

195
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to
see where the last Targaryens are buried?</font>

196
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?</font>

197
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's quite all right, Your Grace.</font>

198
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to see their tombs, really.</font>

199
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like taking a walk through history.</font>

200
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tomb's just up here.</font>

201
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so exciting.</font>

202
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were married here, Your Grace?</font>

203
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

204
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must seem like only yesterday.</font>

205
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.</font>

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband was buried here as well?</font>

207
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storms End.</font>

208
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a tragedy.</font>

209
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fairly predictable tragedy.</font>

210
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hunting and drinking don't mix.</font>

211
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should say not.</font>

212
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son's a hunter. It helps him forget</font>

213
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's never been within a
mile of a real battle.</font>

214
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's
End for the better part of a year.</font>

215
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he laid siege to
was the banquet table in the command tent.</font>

216
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him to stay out
of Robert's Rebellion.</font>

217
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had no business fighting
an actual warrior.</font>

218
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We mothers do what
we canto keep our sons from the grave.</font>

219
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they do seem to yearn for it.</font>

220
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shower them with good sense,</font>

221
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it slides right off,
like rain off a wing.</font>

222
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet the world belongs to them.</font>

223
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.</font>

224
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods have seen fit to make it so</font>

225
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father didn't want them here.</font>

226
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was going to have their bodies burned
and thrown in the Blackwater,</font>

227
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.</font>

228
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad he did.</font>

229
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Your Grace.</font>

230
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they did terrible things at the end,</font>

231
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">but their ancestors built this.</font>

232
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.</font>

233
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't agree more.</font>

234
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we go and see them?</font>

235
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:29,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you give them your love:
they will return it a thousand fold.</font>

236
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:34,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.</font>

237
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You led the defense of King's Landing.</font>

238
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">They adore you.</font>

239
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the doors.</font>

240
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

241
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

242
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Margaery!
Lady Margaery!</font>

243
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bless you, Lady Margaery!</font>

244
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Margaery!</font>

245
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Margaery!</font>

246
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaery!</font>

247
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long live Lady Margaery!</font>

248
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey!</font>

249

<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey!</font>

250
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods bless King Joffrey!</font>

254
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far is it to Deepwood Motte?</font>

255
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not far, my lord.</font>

256
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister is waiting for you there.</font>

257
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.</font>

258
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sewed them'
the men who were torturing you</font>

259
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what they told and waited.</font>

260
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you risk your life for me?</font>

261
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.</font>

262
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only a boy when they took you away.</font>

263
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father brought us up to the bluffs</font>

264
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we could watch you carried off.</font>

265
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember the look
on my father's face when he told us,</font>

266
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."</font>

267
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">And those are the words I heard over again</font>

268
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I saw what they were doing to you.</font>

269
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those men' they said my father
knew what they were doing to me</font>

270
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he?</font>

271
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:28,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, my lord.
They... They never told me much.</font>

272
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister's men are loyal to her.</font>

273
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to hide from them.</font>

274
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all those are your sister's men.</font>

275
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of them are loyal to your father.</font>

276
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

277
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

278
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just thinking how jealous I was</font>

279
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">when my father told Yara
to take this place.</font>

280
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he tell you to do?</font>

281
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Raid fishing villages.</font>

282
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:03,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.</font>

283
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never be a Stark.</font>

284
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark always reminded me of that.</font>

285
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lorded it over you?</font>

286
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't have to.</font>

287
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he had to do was be.</font>

288
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be who he was born to be.</font>

289
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">His life fit him better than his clothes.</font>

290
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?</font>

291
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the King tn the North.</font>

292
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And me...</font>

293
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:30,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father gave me a choice and I made it.</font>

294
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never be a Stark.</font>

295
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:40,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">But ironborn that's what I was born to be.</font>

296
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid the iron price for Winterfell.</font>

297
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I murdered those boys.</font>

298
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stark boys?</font>

299
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never found them.</font>

300
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.</font>

301
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:16,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let Dagmer slit their throats
and I let him burn the bodies,</font>

302
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could keep Winter-fell</font>

303
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make my father proud.</font>

304
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's not too late.</font>

305
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

306
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">My real father lost his
head at King's Landing.</font>

307
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a choice,</font>

308
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I chose wrong.</font>

309
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I've burned everything down.</font>

310
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everything, my lord.</font>

311
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's up here.</font>

312
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yara.
- Shh!</font>

313
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

314
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought him back. He...
He killed the others.</font>

315
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No, I didn't.</font>

316
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't'</font>

317
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">No' Please. Stop!</font>

318
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

319
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put him back where he belongs.</font>

320
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat.</font>

321
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

322
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dying-</font>

323
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't die.</font>

324
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:31,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to live to take revenge.</font>

325
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about revenge.</font>

326
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">You coward.</font>

327
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little misfortune and you're giving up.</font>

328
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Misfor.</font>

329
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Misfortune?</font>

330
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lost your hand.</font>

331
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sword hand I was that hand.</font>

332
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a taste,</font>

333
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">one taste of the real world</font>

334
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">where people have
important things taken from them,</font>

335
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you whine and cry and quit.</font>

336
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like a bloody woman.</font>

337
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you did for me.</font>

338
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.</font>

339
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:45,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called the Sapphire Isle
because of the blue of its water.</font>

340
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew that.</font>

341
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you hem me?</font>

342
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to speak to me?</font>

343
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, about Jaime.</font>

344
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about mm?</font>

345
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to make sure we're doing</font>

346
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything we can to get mm back.</font>

347
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner,</font>

348
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">what did I do in response?</font>

349
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You started a war.</font>

350
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I would start
a war for that lecherous little stump,</font>

351
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:55,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?</font>

352
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you can.</font>

353
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever I can.</font>

354
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still here.</font>

355
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

356
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

357
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it ever occur to you that</font>

358
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be the one who deserves</font>

359
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">your confidence and your trust,</font>

360
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">not your sons?</font>

361
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.</font>

362
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:33,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Years and years of lectures
on family and legacy...</font>

363
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:38,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.</font>

364
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it ever occur to you that your daughter</font>

365
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">might be the only one
listening to them, living by them?</font>

366
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy</font>

367
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you love so much more
than your actual children?</font>

368
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">All fight. Contribute.</font>

369
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrells are a problem.</font>

370
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.</font>

371
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.</font>

372
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaery has her claws in Jeffrey.</font>

373
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows how to manipulate mm.</font>

374
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:24,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.</font>

375
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.</font>

376
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I distrust you because
you're not as smart as you think you are.</font>

377
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod</font>

378
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">over you and everyone else in this city.</font>

379
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:48,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you should try
stopping him from doing what he likes.</font>

380
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

381
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like it Nana?</font>

382
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another golden rose. How original.</font>

383
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I eat from plates stamped with roses.</font>

384
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.</font>

385
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,</font>

386
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if that makes it smell any better.</font>

387
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roses are boring, dear.</font>

388
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Growing strong.“</font>

389
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha' The dullest words of any house.</font>

390
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.</font>

391
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We do not sow." Strong Strong.</font>

392
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are houses you watch out for.</font>

393
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Direwolwes and krakens, fierce beasts.</font>

394
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a golden rose growing strong,</font>

395
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">that strikes fear in the heart.</font>

396
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, little loves.</font>

397
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">A spider in the garden.</font>

398
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run along now. Grow strong.</font>

399
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

400
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.</font>

401
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city has
been made brighter by your presence</font>

402
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city is made brighter by my presence?</font>

403
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:05,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your usual line:
Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?</font>

404
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little obvious, perhaps.</font>

405
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:12,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh no please.
Seduce away It's been so long.</font>

406
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I rather think it's all for naught.</font>

407
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens when
the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?</font>

408
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">A question for the philosophers.</font>

409
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've come mincing
all this way for something.</font>

410
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So?
- Might I sit?</font>

411
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come. I've heard you're such a clever man.</font>

413
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm curious why you've sought me out.</font>

414
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark</font>

415
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Havel?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden</font>

416
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?</font>

417
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.</font>

418
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she?</font>

419
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Not particularly.</font>

420
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's had an interesting childhood.</font>

421
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has. Sadly.</font>

422
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, forgive me for
wasting your time, then.</font>

423
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:59,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.</font>

424
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:03,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.</font>

425
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk with me.</font>

426
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too</font>

427
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:16,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I choose my allies carefully, and
my enemies more carefully still.</font>

428
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is Sansa Stark?</font>

429
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither. A babe in the woods.</font>

430
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admired her father.</font>

431
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:23,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

432
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark had many admirers,</font>

433
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:30,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how marry stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?</font>

434
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.</font>

435
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

436
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.</font>

437
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:42,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.</font>

438
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.</font>

439
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.</font>

440
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger is not long for the capital.</font>

441
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">A confidant of mine has told me that</font>

442
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he goes Sansa Stark goes with him.</font>

443
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why have you come
to me with this matter?</font>

444
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.</font>

445
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?</font>

446
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him better than most,</font>

447
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is the truth.</font>

448
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:17,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.</font>

449
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:22,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.</font>

450
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket</font>

451
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which seems such a shame.</font>

452
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should a man with such a low reputation</font>

453
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">steal away such a lovely bride?</font>

454
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.</font>

455
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I rather enjoy him.</font>

456
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he would see this country burn</font>

457
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he could be king of the ashes.</font>

458
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a clever man, Lord Varys.</font>

459
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.</font>

460
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?</font>

461
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean to disturb you.</font>

462
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't.</font>

463
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like some privacy, please.</font>

464
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.</font>

465
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,</font>

466
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ask the King to
speak with you himself.</font>

467
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you pray for?</font>

468
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you.</font>

469
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

470
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the Sept this morning</font>

471
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,</font>

472
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an end to the war, for a short winter.</font>

473
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:43,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.
And you?</font>

474
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I just can't.</font>

475
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.</font>

476
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,</font>

477
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Manna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.</font>

478
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pig Face," she called me.</font>

479
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">“Pig Face"? That's ridiculous.</font>

480
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had something to do with my nose.</font>

481
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:04,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.</font>

482
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.</font>

483
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.</font>

484
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Porridge plague?</font>

485
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh: you don't have it in the North?</font>

486
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your" skin starts to look like boiled oats,</font>

487
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.</font>

488
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's awful.</font>

489
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're...</font>

490
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believed you!</font>

491
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.</font>

492
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say that. No, you're not.</font>

493
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what happened to Alanna?</font>

494
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman</font>

495
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children</font>

496
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">and live in a castle by the sea.</font>

497
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all terribly frustrating.</font>

498
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she's jealous of you now.</font>

499
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be married here in the capital,</font>

500
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">and shew have to come watch and</font>

501
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">pretend to be happy that you're queen.</font>

502
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want us to be friends, good friends.</font>

503
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would make me very happy.</font>

504
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.</font>

505
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a great
masquerade the night of the harvest moon.</font>

506
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.</font>

507
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:19,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh. I don't think the Queen would
let me leave King's Landing.</font>

508
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Queen Regent you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey. I'll be queen.</font>

509
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you were to marry Loras,</font>

510
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?</font>

511
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:40,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?</font>

512
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name was Bannen.</font>

513
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good man, a good ranger.</font>

514
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came to us from...</font>

515
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did he come from?</font>

516
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down White Harbor way.</font>

517
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came to us from White Harbor.</font>

518
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never failed in his duty.</font>

519
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kept ms vows the best he could.</font>

520
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">He rode far. Fought fiercely.</font>

521
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shall never see his like again.</font>

522
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now his watch has ended.</font>

523
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now his watch has ended.</font>

524
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.</font>

525
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't his foot that killed him.</font>

526
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">That bastard Craster starved him to death.</font>

527
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster's got his daughters to feed.</font>

528
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You on his side?</font>

529
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just show up
and steal all his food.</font>

530
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're brothers of
the Nights Watch not thieves</font>

531
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:01,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day we leave.
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,</font>

532
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes</font>

533
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and laugh at us starving in the snow.</font>

534
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a bloody wildling.</font>

535
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never knew Bannen could smell so good.</font>

536
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one son. Don't you, Mormont?</font>

537
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had my 99th.</font>

538
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever meet a man with 99 sons?</font>

539
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:47,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">And more daughters than I can count.</font>

540
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad for you.</font>

541
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you now?</font>

542
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:53,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, I'll be glad when
you and yours have gone.</font>

543
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as our wounded are strong enough.</font>

544
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

545
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're as strong as they're gonna get.</font>

546
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Them that's dying, why don't you</font>

547
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">out their throats and be done with it?</font>

548
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or leave them if you've not the
stomach, and I'll sort them myself.</font>

549
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose throat you gonna out, old man?</font>

550
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait outside.</font>

551
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.</font>

552
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wives gave you bread.</font>

553
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's sawdust in the bread.</font>

554
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like it,
you go out there and eat the snow.</font>

555
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.</font>

556
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to wait outside.</font>

557
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's sitting there drinking our
wine, eating his fill while we die.</font>

558
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you crows enough.</font>

559
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got to feed my women!</font>

560
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You admit you've got a hidden larder?</font>

561
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">How else you make it through winter?</font>

562
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Enough! Out!
- I am a godly man.</font>

563
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a stingy bastard!</font>

564
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard?</font>

565
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out with you, you little thief.</font>

566
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you! And you!</font>

567
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.</font>

568
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:24,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll chop the hands off
the next man who calls me bastard.</font>

569
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a bastard.</font>

570
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.</font>

571
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods will curse us for this.</font>

572
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">By all the laws...</font>

573
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no laws beyond the Wall.</font>

574
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show us where he hides the food,
or you'll get the same as him.</font>

575
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unhand her.</font>

576
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I shall have your head for this.</font>

577
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quickly Quickly.</font>

578
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

579
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going out there.</font>

580
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we have to go. Now!</font>

581
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me. I know the best way.</font>

582
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

583
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:27,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!</font>

584
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.</font>

585
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I take this hood off yet?</font>

586
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do apologize little lady,</font>

587
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.</font>

588
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt!</font>

589
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.</font>

590
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

591
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not easy finding molasses in wartime.</font>

592
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have some.</font>

593
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go home.</font>

594
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

595
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.</font>

596
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a bunch of swineherds.</font>

597
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us were swineherds.</font>

598
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some of us
tanners and masons. That was before.</font>

599
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:53,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still swineherds
and tanners and masons.</font>

600
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?</font>

601
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

602
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.</font>

603
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beric Dondarrion?</font>

604
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen better days.</font>

605
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I won't see them again.</font>

606
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:15,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.</font>

607
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lot aren't
fighting in a war, you're running from it.</font>

608
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last I heard,
you were King Jeffrey's guard dog.</font>

609
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:26,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here you are 1000 miles from
home. Which of us is running?</font>

610
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Untie these ropes and we'll find out.</font>

611
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:32,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?</font>

612
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark ordered me to execute your
brother in King Robert's name.</font>

613
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark is dead</font>

614
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert is dead.</font>

615
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother's alive.</font>

616
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fighting for ghosts.</font>

617
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:53,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we are,
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.</font>

618
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:58,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't see us, but we see you.</font>

619
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:03,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter whose cloak
you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon,</font>

620
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">you prey on the weak,</font>

621
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:07,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Brotherhood
Without Banners will hunt you down.</font>

622
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You found god? Is that it?</font>

623
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

624
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been reborn
in the light of the one true god.</font>

625
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">As have we all.</font>

626
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">As would any man
who's seen the things we've seen.</font>

627
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you mean to murder
me then get on with it.</font>

628
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll die soon enough, dog.</font>

629
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:29,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it won't be murder, only justice.</font>

630
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a kinder fate than you deserve.
Lions, you call yourselves.</font>

631
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped,</font>

632
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">and babes still on the breast were out
in two while their mothers watched.</font>

633
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.</font>

634
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dump your dead children at some other door.</font>

635
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">House Clegane was built upon dead children.</font>

636
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess
Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.</font>

637
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:55,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you take me for
my brother? ls being born Clegane a crime?</font>

638
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder is a crime.</font>

639
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never touched the Targaryen babes.</font>

640
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never saw them never smelled
them, never heard them bawling.</font>

641
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:07,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to cut my throat, get on with it!</font>

642
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:11,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.</font>

643
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You murdered Mycah.</font>

644
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">The butcher's boy. My friend.</font>

645
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed And you rode mm down</font>

646
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slung him
over your horse like he was some deer.</font>

647
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, he was a bleeder.</font>

648
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't deny killing this boy?</font>

649
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was Jeffrey's sworn shield.</font>

650
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!</font>

651
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:36,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit Jeffrey. Mycah just ran away.</font>

652
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I should have killed you. Not
my place to question princes.</font>

653
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stand accused of murder.</font>

654
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no one here knows the truth</font>

655
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the charge, so it is
not for us to judge you.</font>

656
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the Lord of Light may do that now.</font>

657
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sentence you to trial by combat.</font>

658
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, who will it be?</font>

659
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:07,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we find out
if your fire god really loves you: priest?</font>

660
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:10,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you, archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?</font>

661
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is the little girl the bravest one here?</font>

662
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

663
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">She might be.</font>

664
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's me you'll fight.</font>

665
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">The master says they are untested.</font>

666
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says you would be wise
to blood them early.</font>

667
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:59,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are many small cities between</font>

668
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">here and there, cities ripe for sacking.</font>

669
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should you take captives, the masters will</font>

670
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">buy the healthy ones and for a good price.</font>

671
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who knows?</font>

672
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">In 10 years some of the boys you send them</font>

673
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">may be Unsullied in their turn.</font>

674
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thus, all shall prosper.</font>

675
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:20,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it done, then? They belong to me?</font>

676
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is done.</font>

677
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is done.</font>

678
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">She holds the whip.</font>

679
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hold the whip.</font>

680
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bitch has her army.</font>

681

<font color="#FFFFFF">Unsullied!</font>

682
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:04,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forward march!</font>

683
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt!</font>

684
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:17,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the bitch her beast won't come.</font>

685
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dragon is not a slave.</font>

686
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You speak Valyrian?</font>

687
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen,</font>

688

<font color="#FFFFFF">Unsullied!</font>

691
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slay the masters,</font>

692
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:47,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">slay the soldiers,
slay every man who holds a whip,</font>

693
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">but harm no child.</font>

694
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,100

00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill her! Kill her!</font>

697
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill her!</font>

698
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:01,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dracarys.</font>

699
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unsullied!</font>

700
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:39,144

<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man who wishes to leave may leave,
and no one will harm him.</font>

702
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:48,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give you my word.</font>

703
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:55,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you fight for me?
As free men?</font>
