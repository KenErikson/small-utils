1
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got too
much wood in there.</font>

2
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the more wood, the bigger the fire.</font>

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs to breathe.</font>

4
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take off that big log.</font>

5
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

6
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know your fires.</font>

7
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone built your fires
for you growing up?</font>

8
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.</font>

9
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there were servants, of course.</font>

10
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you were highborn.</font>

11
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.</font>

12
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:04,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buried treasure.
Thousands of years old. I think.</font>

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it do?</font>

14
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure that it does anything.</font>

15
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful, though, isn't it?</font>

16
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much longer?</font>

17
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so far. A few more days.</font>

18
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the Wall as big as they say?</font>

19
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bigger.</font>

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">So big you can't even
see the top sometimes.</font>

21
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hidden in clouds.</font>

22
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're playing with me.</font>

23
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not.</font>

24
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.</font>

25
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a warm day you can see it weeping.</font>

26
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Castle Black is nice enough.</font>

27
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">They keep a fire burning in the long
hall clay and night.</font>

28
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:10,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.</font>

29
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very tasty.</font>

30
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.</font>

31
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dareon sings best.</font>

32
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you sing?
- No.</font>

33
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Not very well.</font>

34
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sing me a song.</font>

35
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all right. Let's see.</font>

36
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

37
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Father's face is stern and strong</font>

38
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sits and judges right from wrong</font>

39
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">He weighs our lives, the short and long</font>

40
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">And loves the little children</font>

41
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mother gives the gift of life</font>

42
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And watches over every wife</font>

43
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her gentle smile ends all strife</font>

44
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she loves her little children</font>

45
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how you skin a rabbit.</font>

46
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to skin a rabbit.</font>

47
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not by the looks of it.</font>

48
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You grow up north of the Wall,</font>

49
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">you learn the proper way to handle game.</font>

50
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see any game before I got here.</font>

51
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.</font>

52
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I made this bow myself.</font>

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.</font>

54
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learn how to use your fists.</font>

55
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?</font>

56
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had someone else in mind.</font>

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, someone else is sitting right here.</font>

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're both very good at skinning rabbits.</font>

59
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us are just a little better.</font>

60
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, some of us would say thank you</font>

61
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">when someone else
hunts down their breakfast for them.</font>

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or don't they teach you
to say thank you north of the Wall?</font>

63
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got
a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.</font>

64
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!
Hmm.</font>

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hodor.
- You've been fighting since you met.</font>

66
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stop it.</font>

67
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Reed here's got a
stick so far up her ass,</font>

68
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.</font>

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been nasty to her every clay.
Of course she's nasty back.</font>

70
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? It's my fault?</font>

71
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.</font>

72
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.</font>

73
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't fight each other.
We'll never make it to the Wall.</font>

74
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you both to make peace.</font>

75
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.</font>

76
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said so, didn't I?</font>

77
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Osha!</font>

78
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good little hunter.</font>

79
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it?</font>

80
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Don't push me.</font>

81
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right here with you.</font>

82
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

83
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right here with you.</font>

84
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with him?</font>

85
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">The visions take their toil.</font>

86
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's having one now?</font>

87
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Jon Snow.</font>

88
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw him? At Castle Black?</font>

89
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was on the wrong side of the Wall,</font>

90
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">surrounded by enemies.</font>

91
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the Wall.</font>

92
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crows would come out
every morning with axes.</font>

93
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your flock gets smaller every year.</font>

94
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever climbed it before?</font>

95
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

96
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.</font>

97
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid.</font>

98
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you?</font>

99
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

100
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's a long way
up and a long way down.</font>

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've waited my whole life
to see the world from up there.</font>

102
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.</font>

103
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're too big for you, but they're good.</font>

104
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kill someone for them?</font>

105
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.</font>

106
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't kill him,
but I bet his balls are still bruised.</font>

107
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.</font>

108
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he didn't do
that thing you do with your tongue.</font>

109
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we not talk about that here?</font>

110
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Can we not talk about that here?</font>

111
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm Jon Snow.</font>

112
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand,</font>

113
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">"but I'm scared of naked girls."</font>

114
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I seem scared the other day?</font>

115
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were trembling like a leaf.</font>

116
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only in the beginning.</font>

117
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

118
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only in the beginning.</font>

119
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.</font>

120
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't worry.</font>

121
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your secrets safe with me.</font>

122
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">What secret?</font>

123
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls</font>

124
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">in silk dresses you knew growing up?</font>

125
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're loyal and you're brave.</font>

126
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't stop being a crow the day
you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.</font>

127
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.</font>

128
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be loyal to your woman.</font>

129
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch don't
care if you live or die.</font>

130
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.</font>

131
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just soldiers
and there's more to carry on if we go down.</font>

132
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:15,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you and me that matters to me and you.</font>

133
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ever betray me.</font>

134
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't.</font>

135
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right
off and wear it 'round me neck.</font>

136
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sink your metal deep</font>

137
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.</font>

138
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you fall, don't scream.</font>

139
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want that
to be the last thing she remembers.</font>

straw men, little lady.</font>

150
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me your position.</font>

151
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your elbow high.</font>

152
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want your back doing the hard labor.</font>

153
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're holding.</font>

154
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never hold.</font>

155
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

156
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your muscles tense up when you hold.</font>

157
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull the string back to
the center of your chin and release.</font>

158
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never hold.</font>

159
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have to aim.</font>

160
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never aim.</font>

161
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never aim?</font>

162
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your eye knows
where it wants the arrow to go.</font>

163
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust your eye.</font>

164
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone out there.</font>

165
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's about far enough.</font>

166
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">We come as friends.</font>

167
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begging your pardon, m'lady,</font>

168
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we'll be the judge of that.</font>

169
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Morghulis.</font>

170
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Dohaeris.</font>

171
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see many priestesses of R'hllor
in the Riverlands.</font>

172
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are Thoros of Myr.</font>

173
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">The High Priest gave you a mission.</font>

174
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn King Robert away from his idols
and towards the Lord of Light.</font>

175
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

176
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed.</font>

177
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You quit, you mean.</font>

178
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">The heathen continue to slaughter each
other and you continue to get drunk.</font>

179
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worship Him your way,
and I'll worship Him mine.</font>

180
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you speak the Common tongue?</font>

181
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.</font>

182
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here, my lady?</font>

183
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive my manners.</font>

184
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see many ladies these days.</font>

185
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky for the ladies.</font>

186
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times has
the Lord brought him back?</font>

187
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six.</font>

188
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not possible.</font>

189
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord has smiled upon me.</font>

190
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should not have this power.</font>

191
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no power.</font>

192
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask the Lord for His favor,</font>

193
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">and He responds as He will.</font>

194
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always been a terrible priest.</font>

195
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drank too much rum.</font>

196
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.</font>

197
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a terrible thing to say,</font>

198
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.</font>

199
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I decided that He, that all the Gods,</font>

200
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">were stories we
told the children to make them behave.</font>

201
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:40,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I wore the robes, and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,</font>

202
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was just for show.</font>

203
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">A spectacle for the locals.</font>

204
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the Mountain
drove a lance through this one's heart.</font>

205
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knelt beside his cold body
and said the old words.</font>

206
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not because I believed in them, but...</font>

207
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:09,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was my friend and he was dead.</font>

208
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they were the only words I knew.</font>

209
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for the first
time in my life, the Lord replied.</font>

210
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beric's eyes opened, and I knew the truth.</font>

211
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our god is the one true god.</font>

212
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all men must serve Him.</font>

213
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been to the other side.</font>

214
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other side?</font>

215
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no other side.</font>

216
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been to the darkness, my lady.</font>

217
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent you to us for a reason.</font>

218
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have someone He needs.</font>

219
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bodkin point.</font>

220
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Penetrates plate at 200 yards.</font>

221
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you make 'em?</font>

222
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
Just need decent steel.</font>

223
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you the steel.</font>

224
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

225
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like that woman.</font>

226
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 'cause you're a girl.</font>

227
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that have to do with anything?</font>

228
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, lad.</font>

229
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? Let go of him.</font>

230
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.</font>

231
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to be one of you. He wants
to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!</font>

232
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">We serve the Lord of Light,
and the Lord of Light needs this boy.</font>

233
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did the Lord of Light tell
you that, or did she?</font>

234
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not doing this for your god.</font>

235
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing it for gold.</font>

236
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doing it for both, girl.</font>

237
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't defend the people without
weapons and horses and food.</font>

238
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.</font>

239
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me
this was a Brotherhood.</font>

240
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me I could be one of you.</font>

241
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are more than they can ever be.</font>

242
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.</font>

243
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will make kings rise and fall.</font>

244
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.</font>

245
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see a darkness in you.</font>

246
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me...</font>

247
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brown eyes,</font>

248
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">blue eyes, green eyes.</font>

249
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eyes you'll shut forever.</font>

250
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will meet again.</font>

251
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You staring at me ass, Jon Snow?</font>

252
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out!</font>

253
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

254
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.</font>

255
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Were you sleeping?</font>

256
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wa...</font>

257
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wa...</font>

258
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water? You want some water.</font>

259
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had some for you.</font>

260
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's play a game.</font>

261
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which body part do you need the least?</font>

262
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

263
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Please" is not a body part.</font>

264
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you everything, please.</font>

265
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've already told me everything.</font>

266
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember?</font>

267
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your daddy was mean to you.</font>

268
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks didn't appreciate you.</font>

269
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">One good bit, though.</font>

270
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stark boys, they're still alive.</font>

271
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?</font>

272
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">You failed, but I'm a
better hunter than you.</font>

273
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

274
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about your little finger? You
don't use that for much, do you?</font>

275
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? Good. Let's start with that.</font>

276
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

277
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been wondering
why you're here, haven't you?</font>

278
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you are.</font>

279
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you.</font>

280
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, guess.</font>

281
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you guess right, I'll tell you.</font>

282
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it.</font>

283
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You win the game</font>

284
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can figure out
who I am and why I'm torturing you,</font>

285
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I win the game
if you beg me to cut off your finger.</font>

286
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I win, you'll let me go?</font>

287
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think this has a happy ending,</font>

288
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">you haven't been paying attention.</font>

289
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

290
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say "please" again
and you'll wish you hadn't.</font>

291
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You first. Where are we?</font>

292
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">The North.</font>

293
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too vague.</font>

294
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deepwood Motte.</font>

295
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible guess.</font>

296
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, where?</font>

297
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last Hearth.</font>

298
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?</font>

299
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karhold!</font>

300
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karhold?</font>

301
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know that?</font>

302
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?</font>

303
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

304
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just a guess.</font>

305
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Lord Theon.</font>

306
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who am I?</font>

307
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torrhen Karstark.</font>

308
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

309
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strangled by the Kingslayer.</font>

310
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was your brother.</font>

311
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.</font>

312
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore to tell me if I...</font>

313
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

314
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.</font>

315
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I betrayed Robb.</font>

316
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you're torturing me.</font>

317
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes..</font>

318
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">You win.</font>

319
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:02,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you forgot to ask one question.</font>

320
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.</font>

321
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I am.</font>

322
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything I told you is a lie.</font>

323
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't happening to you for a reason.</font>

324
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, well, one reason...</font>

325
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I enjoy it.</font>

326
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!</font>

327
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I win.</font>

328
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for riding here so quickly.</font>

329
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know travel isn't easy in these times.</font>

330
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.</font>

331
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the King of
the North summons us, we come.</font>

332
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our father has instructed
us to tell you that his alliance</font>

333
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the North can continue
if his terms are met.</font>

334
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Frey requires a formal apology</font>

335
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.</font>

336
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.</font>

337
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">As restitution for this betrayal,</font>

338
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.</font>

339
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that's...</font>

340
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are fighting for the North.</font>

341
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harrenhal is not in the North.</font>

342
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:25,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is his once the war is over and we
have no further strategic need for it.</font>

343
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's something else.</font>

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will do whatever
we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.</font>

345
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not what, whom.</font>

346
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

347
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no.</font>

348
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our father requires Lord Edmure to
wed one of his daughters. Roslin.</font>

349
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old is she?</font>

350
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nineteen.</font>

351
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I see her first?</font>

352
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to count her teeth?</font>

353
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We depart for the Twins in the morning.</font>

354
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need an answer before we leave,</font>

355
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter</font>

356
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">or this alliance is at an end.</font>

357
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father does
realize we're in the middle of a war?</font>

358
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father is old.</font>

359
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will put his heart at peace if he
could see her wed to a good husband.</font>

360
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">And his recent experience
has made him wary of long engagements.</font>

361
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has every right to be.</font>

362
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please excuse us while we discuss it.</font>

363
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I let
that old ferret choose my bride for me?</font>

364
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.</font>

365
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his liege lord.</font>

366
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.</font>

367
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't wound him. My answer is no.</font>

368
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me and listen
very carefully. You...</font>

369
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">The laws of gods and men are very clear.</font>

370
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">No man can compel another man to marry.</font>

371
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.</font>

372
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. You heard him.</font>

373
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you refuse,
our alliance with the Freys is dead.</font>

374
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wanted me for
one of his daughters since I was 12.</font>

375
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not gonna stop wanting it now.</font>

376
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I say no, he will come back</font>

377
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">and offer me a daughter of my choosing.</font>

378
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're willing to risk our freedom</font>

379
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?</font>

380
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a war to fight.</font>

381
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.</font>

382
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you wanted
to make amends for the Stone Mill.</font>

383
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">You recall that heroic engagement?</font>

384
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had something less permanent in mind.</font>

385
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've won every battle,
but I'm losing this war.</font>

386
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't do this and
do it now, we're lost.</font>

387
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll marry her.</font>

388
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're paying
for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right.</font>

389
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll remember it.</font>

390
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see my men have finally found
you something appropriate to wear.</font>

391
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Most kind of them.</font>

392
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.</font>

393
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am acting on Lady Stark's orders</font>

394
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">to return Jaime Lannister
to King's Landing.</font>

395
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">When King Robb left
Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.</font>

396
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.</font>

397
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should send you back to Robb Stark.</font>

398
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should.</font>

399
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">But instead, you're sitting here,
watching me fail at dinner.</font>

400
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why might that be?</font>

401
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.</font>

402
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know who would pay the most.</font>

403
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me</font>

404
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.</font>

405
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

406
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.</font>

407
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be,</font>

408
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you honestly believed
my father would never find out about it.</font>

409
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.</font>

410
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't have time for anything else.</font>

411
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll make time for you.</font>

412
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as you're well enough to travel,</font>

413
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will allow you to go to King's Landing</font>

414
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">as restitution
for the mistakes my soldiers made.</font>

415
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will swear to
tell your father the truth,</font>

416
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I had nothing to do with your maiming.</font>

417
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we drink on it?</font>

418
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't partake.</font>

419
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:12,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?</font>

420
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

421
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:21,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, may our journey
continue without further incident.</font>

422
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she won't be going with you.</font>

423
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...</font>

424
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are charged
with abetting treason.</font>

425
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I must insist.</font>

426
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in no place to insist on anything.</font>

427
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have hoped you'd
learned your lesson</font>

428
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">about overplaying your position.</font>

429
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impossible.
- Why?</font>

430
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.</font>

431
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.</font>

432
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your daughter...
- Is rich,</font>

433
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms,</font>

434
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the mother of the King.</font>

435
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old.</font>

436
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old?</font>

437
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old.</font>

438
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm something of an expert on the subject.</font>

439
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her change will be upon her before long.</font>

440
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.</font>

441
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,</font>

442
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is another matter entirely.</font>

443
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.</font>

444
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">My stomach remains quite strong, however.</font>

445
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that might
turn it are details</font>

446
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your grandson's nocturnal activities.</font>

447
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you deny them?</font>

448
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, not at all.</font>

449
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sword-swallower through and through.</font>

450
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">A boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity</font>

451
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">to marry
the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms</font>

452
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">and remove the stain from his name.</font>

453
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?</font>

454
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sons of your
father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?</font>

455
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

456
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:03,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you never...</font>

457
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

458
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not once? Not in any way?</font>

459
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.</font>

460
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I congratulate you upon your restraint.</font>

461
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's natural,
boys having a go beneath the sheets.</font>

462
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:22,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps Highgarden has a high
tolerance for unnatural behavior.</font>

463
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't say that.</font>

464
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">True, we don't tie ourselves in knots</font>

465
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">over a discreet bit of buggery, but</font>

466
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">brothers and sisters...</font>

467
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I come from, that stain would
be very difficult to wash out.</font>

468
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not breathe further life</font>

469
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a malicious lie by discussing it.</font>

470
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lie or not,</font>

471
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.</font>

472
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands</font>

473
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">and send them off
to kill Lannisters and Tyrells,</font>

474
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">thanks to our new affiliation.</font>

475
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what people believe.</font>

476
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">And neither do you.</font>

477
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an authority on myself, I must disagree.</font>

478
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,</font>

479
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">then Joffrey is no king at all,</font>

480
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.</font>

481
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,</font>

482
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.</font>

483
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a chance we simply cannot take.</font>

484
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?</font>

485
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

486
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll remove it for you.</font>

487
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,</font>

488
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will name him to the Kingsguard.</font>

489
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.</font>

490
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will never marry.
He will never have children.</font>

491
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

492
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrell name will fade.</font>

493
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Highgarden will
go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.</font>

494
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?</font>

495
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior</font>

496
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">who takes his vows seriously.</font>

497
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, shall I draw up the order?</font>

498
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you consent to this match?</font>

499
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:26,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a rare enough thing,
a man who lives up to his reputation.</font>

500
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

501
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've gotta cut them loose!</font>

502
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

503
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my hand!</font>

504
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a wonderful pin.</font>

505
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more of a brooch, really.</font>

506
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...</font>

507
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very happy about...</font>

508
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I am as well.</font>

509
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I'm in a dream.</font>

510
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, me, too. Definitely.</font>

511
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've dreamed of
a large wedding since I was young.</font>

512
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guests, the food, the tournaments.</font>

513
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the bride, of course.</font>

514
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most beautiful bride in the world</font>

515
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a beautiful gown of gold and
green brocade with fringed sleeves.</font>

516
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?</font>

517
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I had never left Winterfell</font>

518
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I came to King's Landing.</font>

519
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it sounds wonderful.
I can't wait to see it.</font>

520
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to leave this place.</font>

521
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's terrible, isn't it?</font>

522
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most terrible place there is.</font>

523
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.</font>

524
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can have them both killed.</font>

525
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to say which of the four of us</font>

526
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">is getting the worst of this arrangement.</font>

527
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably Sansa.</font>

528
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:57,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though Loras will certainly come to
know a deep and singular misery.</font>

529
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father doesn't discriminate.</font>

530
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all being shipped
off to hell together.</font>

531
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a boat you built.</font>

532
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.</font>

533
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I did to protect our family.</font>

534
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your family.</font>

535
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">A member of your family who has actively</font>

536
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">contributed to that family's survival.</font>

537
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whether or not you
or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.</font>

538
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do admit it.</font>

539
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for your
trick with the wildfire,</font>

540
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.</font>

541
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.</font>

542
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.</font>

543
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are two people in King's Landing</font>

544
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">who can give an order to a Kingsguard.</font>

545
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon</font>

546
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">to kill me during the
Battle of the Blackwater?</font>

547
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">The impulse I understand.</font>

548
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hates me because I'm the only one</font>

549
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">who tells him what he really is.</font>

550
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:20,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, fair enough.
He wants me dead. But his stupidity?</font>

551
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could have had me
poisoned and no one would have known.</font>

552
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the King orders a Kingsguard</font>

553
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">to murder the Hand
of the King in full view of his own army.</font>

554
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy's an idiot.</font>

555
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to say?</font>

556
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.</font>

557
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably.</font>

558
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.</font>

559
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven kingdoms united in fear
of Tywin Lannister.</font>

560
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the Tyrells.</font>

561
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.</font>

562
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey will belong to Margaery,
the little doe-eyed whore,</font>

563
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so will his children
and their children.</font>

564
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">History will be taken from our hands.</font>

565
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may escape, at least.</font>

566
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once Jaime gets back,</font>

567
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras may come down with a terrible
case of sword through bowels.</font>

568
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Jaime gets back, yes.</font>

569
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when will that be?
He's out there somewhere.</font>

570
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.</font>

571
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's going to tell her?</font>

572
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think people will like it?</font>

573
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think they
will even notice it.</font>

574
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. It's not my wedding.</font>

575
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, from what I can tell,</font>

576
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dressmakers in Highgarden will be</font>

577
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">far superior to the ones in King's Landing.</font>

578
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd never make me
anything as dull as this for my wedding.</font>

579
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras likes green and gold brocade.</font>

580
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure he does.</font>

581
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will they let me invite my family?</font>

582
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">They haven't asked my opinion.</font>

583
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">But do you think they will?</font>

584
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

585
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.</font>

586
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I...</font>

587
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon, my lady.</font>

588
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was
trying on a gown for Jeffrey's wedding.</font>

589
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it should be quite a wedding.</font>

590
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.</font>

591
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

592
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alone, if I may.</font>

593
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you need to speak to her alone?</font>

594
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae.</font>

595
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please excuse her. She's not from here.</font>

596
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.</font>

597
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes we think
we want to hear something,</font>

598
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's only afterwards,
when it's too late,</font>

599
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we realize we wished we'd heard it</font>

600
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">under entirely different circumstances.</font>

601
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, really.</font>

602
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to begin?</font>

603
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... This...</font>

604
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">This... This is awkward.</font>

605
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">A thousand blades</font>

606
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,</font>

607
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.</font>

608
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't 1,000 blades.</font>

609
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't even 200.</font>

610
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've counted.</font>

611
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you have.</font>

612
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugly old thing.</font>

613
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet it has a certain appeal.</font>

614
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lysa Arryn of chairs.</font>

615
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.</font>

616
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Early days, my friend.</font>

617
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is flattering, really,</font>

618
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.</font>

619
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition, I promise you.</font>

620
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although who doesn't like to see</font>

621
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">their friends fail now and then?</font>

622
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so right.</font>

623
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">For instance, when I thwarted your plan</font>

624
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.</font>

625
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm going to be honest,</font>

626
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:20,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did feel an unmistakable
sense of enjoyment there.</font>

627
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your confidant,</font>

628
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one who fed
you information about my plans,</font>

629
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one you swore to protect...</font>

630
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't bring her any enjoyment.</font>

631
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.</font>

632
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a bad investment on my part.</font>

633
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:49,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.</font>

634
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something daring.</font>

635
00:47:53,621 --> 00:48:00,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was so grateful
to me for providing this fresh experience.</font>

636
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I did for the good of the realm.</font>

637
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">The realm?</font>

638
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what the realm is?</font>

639
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the 1,000 blades of Aegon's enemies.</font>

640
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:22,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">A story we agree
to tell each other over and over,</font>

641
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">till we forget that it's a lie.</font>

642
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:29,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?</font>

643
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chaos. A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.</font>

644
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chaos isn't a pit.</font>

645
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chaos is a ladder.</font>

646
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many who try to climb it fail
and never get to try again.</font>

647
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fall breaks them.</font>

648
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some are given
a chance to climb, but they refuse.</font>

649
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:12,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cling to the realm
or the Gods or love.</font>

650
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Illusions.</font>

651
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the ladder is real.</font>

652
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">The climb is all there is.</font>
