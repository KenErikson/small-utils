00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fall back!</font>

2
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother?</font>

3
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you send the ravens?</font>

4
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarly, look at me.</font>

5
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you send the ravens?</font>

6
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was your job.</font>

7
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your only job.</font>

8
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get back to the Wall.</font>

9
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a long march.</font>

10
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know what's out there,</font>

11
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we have to make it, have to warn them</font>

12
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">or before winter's done,</font>

13
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone you've ever known will be dead.</font>

14
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?</font>

15
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.</font>

16
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they stop being shy, they get angry.</font>

17
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they're angry,</font>

18
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground</font>

19
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a hammer on a nail.</font>

20
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crow!
Crow!</font>

21
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look over there!</font>

22
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crow!</font>

23
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crow! Look over here! Look!</font>

24
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, crow coming!</font>

25
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crow!</font>

26
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wearing the wrong color.</font>

27
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance was a ranger.</font>

28
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.</font>

29
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm free, will I be free to go?</font>

30
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crow!
- Crow!</font>

31
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, you will.</font>

32
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll be free to kill you.</font>

33
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got no respect this lot.</font>

34
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got no fathers to slap
them when they're foul.</font>

35
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to their fathers?</font>

36
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of them were killed by crows like you.</font>

37
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.</font>

38
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.</font>

39
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he don't...</font>

40
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smell a crow.</font>

41
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">We killed his friends.
Thought you'd want to question this one.</font>

42
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we want with a baby crow?</font>

43
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.</font>

44
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to be one of us.</font>

45
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.</font>

46
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends twice your size.</font>

47
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father told me
big men fall just as quick as little ones</font>

48
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you put a sword through their hearts.</font>

49
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plenty of little men
tried to put their swords through my heart.</font>

50
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's plenty of little skeletons</font>

51
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">buried in the woods.</font>

52
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name, boy?</font>

53
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon Snow.</font>

54
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

55
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace?</font>

56
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear that?</font>

57
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fan.</font>

58
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand, boy.</font>

59
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.</font>

60
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.</font>

61
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones. You can leave us.</font>

62
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl likes you.</font>

63
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like her back, Snow?</font>

64
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">That why you want to join us?</font>

65
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't panic, boy.</font>

66
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't the damned Night's Watch</font>

67
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">where we make you swear off girls.</font>

68
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">This chicken eater you thought was
king is Tormund Giantsbane.</font>

69
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't believe this pup
killed the Half hand.</font>

70
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was our enemy</font>

71
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm glad he's dead.</font>

72
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was my brother once.</font>

73
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back when he had a whole hand.</font>

74
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you doing with him?</font>

75
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord Commander
sent me to the Half hand for seasoning.</font>

76
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

77
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants me to lead one day.</font>

78
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here you are, a traitor,</font>

79
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.</font>

80
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.</font>

81
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?</font>

82
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be free.</font>

83
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think so.</font>

84
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think what you
want most of all is to be a hero.</font>

85
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ask you one last time,</font>

86
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">why do you want to join us?</font>

87
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">We stopped at Craster's Keep
on the way north.</font>

88
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw...</font>

89
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what?</font>

90
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:35,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Craster take his own baby
boy and leave it in the woods.</font>

91
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw what took it.</font>

92
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:46,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me you saw one of them?</font>

93
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would that make you
desert your brothers?</font>

94
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when I told the Lord Commander,</font>

95
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">he already knew.</font>

96
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:04,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands of years ago,
the First Men defeated the While Walkers.</font>

97
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.</font>

98
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I come to the right place?</font>

99
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need to find you a new cloak.</font>

100
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you took off that bit there?</font>

101
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you
want to leave something to the imagination?</font>

102
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.</font>

103
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to take it off.</font>

104
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mouth.</font>

105
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.</font>

106
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't hear that.</font>

107
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies, ser.
Back away.</font>

108
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep backing away
till you're outside this establishment.</font>

109
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then back away some more.</font>

110
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Tyrion sent me.</font>

111
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will murder you, boy.</font>

112
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it was a matter of life and death.</font>

113
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod?</font>

114
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your sister.</font>

115
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">The queen.</font>

116
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing here?</font>

117
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?</font>

118
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think so.</font>

119
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wanted to kill you,
do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?</font>

120
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stay outside.</font>

121
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid of you, little brother.</font>

122
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

123
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to see your face.</font>

124
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said you'd lost your nose,</font>

125
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's not as gruesome as all that.</font>

126
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who cut me lost more than his nose.</font>

127
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should hope so.</font>

128
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rebels came
for Jeffrey's head, they lost their own.</font>

129
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to Father.</font>

130
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to Father.</font>

131
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.</font>

132
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? Curious.</font>

133
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:18,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.</font>

134
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I don't suppose
you need much room.</font>

135
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.</font>

136
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be proud to be as funny as a
man whose balls brush his knees.</font>

137
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're meeting Father today?</font>

138
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

139
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I have
hundreds of spies in my employ.</font>

140
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.</font>

141
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father told me. What do you want from him?</font>

142
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I want from him? He's my father.</font>

143
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I need to want something?</font>

144
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:53,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any
father loves his child, his baby boy.</font>

145
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet he hasn't come to visit once...</font>

146
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- ... since arriving in King's Landing.</font>

147
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lay here, my face split in half,</font>

148
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Father never came.</font>

149
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to make me cry.</font>

150
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you care what I want from him?</font>

151
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because
you've slandered me to Father before.</font>

152
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slandered? When?</font>

153
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.</font>

154
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did have your
guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.</font>

155
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was nine, too.</font>

156
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.</font>

157
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I remember correctly,</font>

158
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">she never stole a necklace again.</font>

159
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not slander if it's true.</font>

160
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?</font>

161
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?</font>

162
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're a liar.</font>

163
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you'll
tell lies about me, about Joffrey.</font>

164
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any lies in particular?</font>

165
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a clever man,</font>

166
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not as clever as you think you are.</font>

167
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.</font>

168
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

169
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at these two shining warriors.</font>

170
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:15,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.</font>

171
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Meryn Trant.</font>

172
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.</font>

173
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're no knight.
- Pod.</font>

174
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.</font>

175
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an up-jumped
cutthroat, nothing more.</font>

176
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly who I am.</font>

177
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're a grub in fancy armor</font>

178
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's better at
beating little girls than fighting men.</font>

179
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.</font>

180
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put your hand on that door,</font>

181
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">you lose the hand.</font>

182
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,</font>

183
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am wondering why you sent for me.</font>

184
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many people in this city want to kill me.
You're here to protect me.</font>

185
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been doing that for a while now.</font>

186
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you grow bored protecting me?</font>

187
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grow poor protecting you.</font>

188
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor? Poor?</font>

189
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under my patronage you've become a knight,</font>

190
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.</font>

191
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Briefly.</font>

192
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you filled your pockets.</font>

193
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now my pockets are empty.</font>

194
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've given me a taste
for the finer things.</font>

195
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.</font>

196
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were friends.</font>

197
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are.</font>

198
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.</font>

199
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.</font>

200
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How much?
- Double.</font>

201
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double?</font>

202
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a knight now.</font>

203
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knights are worth double.</font>

204
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.</font>

205
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means you can afford it.</font>

206
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Here!</font>

207
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

208
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

209
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in the battle at Blackwater.</font>

210
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a captain and a knight.</font>

211
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, ser, and sewing which king?</font>

212
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one true king of Westeros,</font>

213
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis Baralheon.</font>

214
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were dead.</font>

215
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone thought you were dead.</font>

216
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your son?</font>

217
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">He may have swam ashore as you did.</font>

218
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the wildfire look him. I saw it.</font>

219
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry, my friend.</font>

220
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">L, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.</font>

221
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:26,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Davos, you were a good father.</font>

222
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I was a good father, he'd still be here.</font>

223
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis lives?</font>

224
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.</font>

225
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you take me there?</font>

226
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.</font>

227
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war is not over.</font>

228
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.</font>

229
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're both sworn to King Stannis.</font>

230
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sworn to no man.</font>

231
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.</font>

232
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I delivered the ships.</font>

233
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis never gives up. Never.</font>

234
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he will regroup...</font>

235
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a broken man.</font>

236
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">His fleet lies at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay.</font>

237
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.</font>

238
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:13,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames</font>

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">and burning men alive.</font>

240
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

241
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.</font>

242
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those who spoke against her
she called servants of darkness.</font>

243
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say she sang to them as they burned.</font>

244
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a pirate.</font>

245
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.</font>

246
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.</font>

247
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me back there, please.</font>

248
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot turn
Stannis against her.</font>

249
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.</font>

250
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could try.</font>

251
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you fail, they will burn you.</font>

252
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you succeed, they'll burn you.</font>

253
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've only just come back to life.</font>

254
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay alive
a little longer, my friend.</font>

255
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.</font>

256
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you drank with me on four of mine,</font>

257
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't ask you for favors.</font>

258
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.</font>

259
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you are dead,</font>

260
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will gather your bones in a little sack</font>

261
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let your widow
wear them around her neck.</font>

262
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should set
the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.</font>

263
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.</font>

264
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mountain will defend
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.</font>

265
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters
have been running from us since Oxcross.</font>

266
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love a fight. The
men would love a fight.</font>

267
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we're going to get one.</font>

268
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two hundred Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.</font>

269
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">The debt will be repaid, my friend.</font>

270
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">For them and for your sons.</font>

271
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will it?</font>

272
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">They rot in the ground
while their killer runs free.</font>

273
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.</font>

274
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">My best hunters are after him.</font>

275
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Mallister?</font>

276
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Jeremy.</font>

277
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's bannerman.</font>

278
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find her a chamber that
will serve as a cell.</font>

279
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's your mother.</font>

280
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">She freed Jaime Lannister.</font>

281
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters robbed them of their sons</font>

282
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she robbed them of their justice.</font>

283
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water.</font>

284
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water.</font>

285
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">This needs to be cleaned and closed.</font>

286
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name, friend?</font>

287
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Qyburn.</font>

288
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky to be alive.</font>

289
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky?</font>

290
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">The badge looks good on you.</font>

291
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost as good as it looked on me.</font>

292
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you enjoying your new position?</font>

293
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I enjoying it?</font>

294
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was very happy as Hand of the King.</font>

295
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I heard how happy you were.</font>

296
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought a whore into my bed.</font>

297
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't your bed at the time.</font>

298
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent you here to advise the king.</font>

299
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you real power and authority.</font>

300
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You chose to spend your days</font>

301
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">as you always have,</font>

302
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:55,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.</font>

303
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Occasionally I drank with the harlots.</font>

304
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want, Tyrion?</font>

305
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does everyone assume
I want something?</font>

306
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?</font>

307
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">My beloved father who</font>

308
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">somehow forgot to visit his wounded son</font>

309
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">After he fell on the battlefield.</font>

310
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.</font>

311
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I organized the defense of this city</font>

312
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you held court in
the ruins of Harrenhal.</font>

313
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate</font>

314
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:34,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">while your grandson, the king,
quivered in fear behind the walls.</font>

315
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bled in the mud for our family.</font>

316
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:43,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as my reward, I was trundled
off to some dark little cell.</font>

317
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what do I want?</font>

318
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little bloody gratitude would be a start.</font>

319
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jugglers and singers require applause.</font>

320
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a Lannister.</font>

321
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I demanded a garland of roses</font>

322
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">every time I suffered a
wound on a battlefield?</font>

323
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

324
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after</font>

325
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">and three of them are in open rebellion.</font>

326
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:13,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me what you want.</font>

327
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want what is mine by right.</font>

328
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.</font>

329
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:30,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.</font>

330
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day Jaime put on the white cloak,</font>

331
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.</font>

332
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your son and lawful heir.</font>

333
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want Casterly Rock?</font>

334
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is mine by right.</font>

335
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name</font>

336
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as a reward for your accomplishments</font>

337
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">during the battle of Blackwater Bay.</font>

338
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the time is right, you will be
given a position fit for your talents</font>

339
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you can
serve your family and protect our legacy.</font>

340
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.</font>

341
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots</font>

342
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:22,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">before mocking the family
name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.</font>

343
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

344
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask that?</font>

345
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?</font>

346
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature</font>

347
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">full of envy, lust, and low cunning.</font>

348
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colors</font>

349
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">since I cannot prove that you are not mine.</font>

350
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to teach me humility,
the Gods have condemned me</font>

351
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion</font>

352
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was my fathers sigil
and his fathers before him.</font>

353
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">But neither Gods nor men</font>

354
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">will ever compel me to
let you turn Casterly Rock</font>

355
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">into your whorehouse.</font>

356
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, now.</font>

357
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak no more of
your rights to Casterly Rock.</font>

358
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

359
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more thing.</font>

360
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.</font>

361
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dorne. It's going to Dorne.</font>

362
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why Dome?</font>

363
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's carrying silk</font>

364
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.</font>

365
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not coming back.</font>

366
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">The captain's tired of risking his life</font>

367
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">so King's Landing lords and ladies</font>

368
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.</font>

369
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to stay in Dorne.</font>

370
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.</font>

371
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met some people in Dome
who weren't so beautiful and warm.</font>

372
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ruin the game.</font>

373
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, I don't want to play.</font>

374
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about that one there?</font>

375
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one? It's going to Volantis.</font>

376
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

377
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when I got on a ship in
Volantis, it looked like that one.</font>

378
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how the game works.</font>

379
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.</font>

380
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:46,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.</font>

381
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?</font>

382
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.</font>

383
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely day for it.</font>

384
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watching the ships.</font>

385
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish.</font>

386
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:07,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might I speak
with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?</font>

387
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your mother not long ago.</font>

388
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's very eager to see you.</font>

389
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your sister.</font>

390
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aryans alive?</font>

391
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you'd take me home.</font>

392
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said King's Landing was your home.</font>

393
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.</font>

394
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were to tell just one person...</font>

395
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't tell anyone.</font>

396
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know?</font>

397
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm a terrible liar.</font>

398
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said so yourself.</font>

399
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.</font>

400
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:05,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm waiting for word on an assignment that
will take me far away from the capital.</font>

401
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.</font>

402
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll need to
be ready to leave on a moment's notice.</font>

403
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're her handmaiden?</font>

404
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And you're his...</font>

405
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I help manage his affairs.</font>

406
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an important person.</font>

407
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is she.</font>

408
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.</font>

409
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day she was born, they rang the
bells from sunrise till sunset.</font>

410
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've both done rather well, you and I.</font>

411
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

412
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Given where we started.</font>

413
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where is that?</font>

414
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not easy
for girls like us to dig our way out.</font>

415
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out for her.</font>

416
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always do.</font>

417
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out for her with him.</font>

418
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're growing fast.</font>

419
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not fast enough.</font>

420
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can! wait that long.</font>

421
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need an army.</font>

422
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.</font>

423
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say the Unsullied
are the greatest soldiers in the world.</font>

424
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.</font>

425
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">The distinction
means a good deal to some people.</font>

426
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do those people have any better ideas</font>

427
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how to put you on the Iron Throne?</font>

428
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too beautiful a day to argue.</font>

429
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're right.</font>

430
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another lovely day on the high seas.</font>

431
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mock them.</font>

432
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the first Dothraki on a ship.</font>

433
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">They followed me across the poison water.</font>

434
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they'll do it,
others will. And with a true khalasar...</font>

435
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:03,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki follow strength
above all, Khaleesi.</font>

436
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have a true
khalasar when you prove yourself strong.</font>

437
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not before.</font>

438
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

439
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you were dead.</font>

440
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

441
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.</font>

442
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are alone.</font>

443
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, you are the rightful king.</font>

444
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only by blood.</font>

445
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an honorable man, a just man.</font>

446
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there is still a war to fight.</font>

447
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am fighting.</font>

448
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">By burning prisoners alive?</font>

449
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?</font>

450
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:35,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not judge people
for the Gods they worship.</font>

451
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea</font>

452
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.</font>

453
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your enemy.</font>

454
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my enemy.</font>

455
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?</font>

456
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I set your ships ablaze?</font>

457
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't there when the wildfire</font>

458
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">killed our men by the thousands.</font>

459
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have saved those men.</font>

460
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have taken the city, Stannis
would sit upon his rightful throne,</font>

461
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you would stand beside him.</font>

462
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wasn't there</font>

463
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.</font>

464
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear them screaming?</font>

465
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:33,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those burning men
in the water crying for their mothers,</font>

466
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">for their Gods for help?</font>

467
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.</font>

468
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't despair, Ser Davos.</font>

469
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I told your son is true.</font>

470
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death by fire is the purest death.</font>

471
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This woman is evil!</font>

472
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the mother of demons.</font>

473
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him and lock him in a cell.</font>

474
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace!
- Come on.</font>

475
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.</font>

476
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will destroy us all!</font>

477
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will pray for you.</font>

478
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace!</font>

479
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt. Down.</font>

480
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt. Down.</font>

481
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have we stopped?</font>

482
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.</font>

483
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?</font>

484
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.
We should have guards, my lady.</font>

485
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

486
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me.</font>

487
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.</font>

488
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have others.</font>

489
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?</font>

490
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

491
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a soldier.</font>

492
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:45,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went to fight on the walls when the
ships came into Blackwater Bay.</font>

493
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never came back.</font>

494
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your mother?</font>

495
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died when she had me.</font>

496
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad men wanted to
come into this city and do terrible things,</font>

497
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your father stopped them.</font>

498
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you look at this knight,</font>

499
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to remember your father.</font>

500
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:18,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.</font>

501
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do knights swear to do?</font>

502
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:24,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protect the weak and uphold the good.</font>

503
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father did that. Be proud of him.</font>

504
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was your father a soldier, too?</font>

505
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be proud, too.</font>

506
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:44,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under King Jeffrey's
leadership, your fathers saved the city.</font>

507
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">They saved us all.</font>

508
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on, we're going
to take care of you.</font>

509
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you.</font>

510
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to me for what you need to feed
them, clothe them, or house them.</font>

511
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Directly to me.</font>

512
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.</font>

513
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:28,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, sit. Sit.</font>

514
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do apologize, my lady.</font>

515
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small Council meetings.</font>

516
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">At what point does
it become treason to waste the king's time?</font>

517
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lovely gown, my lady.</font>

518
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:45,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it suits you perfectly.</font>

519
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine you might be rather cold.</font>

520
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">The climate is a bit more forgiving</font>

521
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">back in Highgarden, Your Grace.</font>

522
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I have them
bring you a shawl, my lady?</font>

523
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.</font>

524
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.</font>

525
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't it, Loras?</font>

526
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

527
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?</font>

528
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.</font>

529
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen anything like it.</font>

530
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might find a bit of armor quite useful</font>

531
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">once you become queen. Perhaps before.</font>

532
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey tells me you
stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom</font>

533
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">on your way back from
the sept this morning.</font>

534
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:25,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage
the High Septon told me about.</font>

535
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaery does a great deal of work</font>

536
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the poor back in Highgarden.</font>

537
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lowest
among us are no different from the highest</font>

538
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you give them a chance</font>

539
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">and approach them with an open heart.</font>

540
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">An open heart is what you'll get</font>

541
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're not careful, my dear.</font>

542
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not long ago,
we were attacked by a mob there.</font>

543
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.</font>

544
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king barely escaped with his life.</font>

545
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:53,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.</font>

546
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:57,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facts become less and
less important to her as she grows older.</font>

547
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our lives were never truly in danger.</font>

548
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, of course.</font>

549
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are your father's son.</font>

550
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't all have a king's bravery.</font>

551
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hunger turns men into beasts.</font>

552
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad House Tyrell
has been able to help in this regard.</font>

553
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:27,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tell me 100
wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.</font>

554
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.</font>

555
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:35,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's our duty
to assist the capital in time of need.</font>

556
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, as Ser Loras said,</font>

557
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Margaery has done this son</font>

558
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">of, uh, charitable work before.</font>

559
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she knows what she's doing.</font>

560
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she does.</font>

561
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:22,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Unsullied have stood here for
a day and a night with no food or water.</font>

562
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will stand until they drop.</font>

563
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such is their obedience.</font>

564
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">They may suit my needs.
Tell me of their training.</font>

565
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Westerosi woman is pleased with them,</font>

566
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:48,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">but speaks no praise to
keep the price down.</font>

567
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wishes to know how they are trained.</font>

568
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her what
she would know and be quick about it.</font>

569
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day is hot.</font>

570
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">They begin their training at 5.</font>

571
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day they drill from dawn to dusk</font>

572
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">until they have mastered the shortsword,</font>

573
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">the shield, and the three spears.</font>

574
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one boy in four
survives this rigorous training.</font>

575
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:20,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.</font>

576
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">They fear nothing.</font>

577
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the bravest men fear death.</font>

578
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">The knight says even brave men fear death.</font>

579
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the old man he smells of piss.</font>

580
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truly, Master?</font>

581
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not truly.</font>

582
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:40,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a girl or a goat
to ask such a thing?</font>

583
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:50,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">My master says the Unsullied
are not men. Death means nothing to them.</font>

584
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:56,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner</font>

585
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">to open her eyes and watch.</font>

586
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">He begs you attend
to this carefully, Your Grace.</font>

587
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the good master there is no need.</font>

588
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's worried about their nipples?</font>

589
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the dumb bitch know
we've cut off their balls?</font>

590
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">My master
points out that men don't need nipples.</font>

591
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, I'm done with you.</font>

592
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one is pleased to have served you.</font>

593
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">To win his shield,</font>

594
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:52,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">an Unsullied must go
to the slave marts with a silver mark,</font>

595
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">find a newborn
and kill it before its mother's eyes.</font>

596
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, my master says, we make certain</font>

597
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is no weakness left in them.</font>

598
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take a babe from its mothers arms,</font>

599
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain with a silver coin?</font>

600
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is offended.</font>

601
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asks
if you pay a silver coin to the mother,</font>

602
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">for her dead baby.</font>

603
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:23,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a soft mewling fool this one is.</font>

604
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">My master would
like you to know that the silver is paid</font>

605
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the baby's owner, not the mother.</font>

606
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many do you have to sell?</font>

607
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight thousand.</font>

608
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the Westerosi whore
she has until tomorrow.</font>

609
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master Kraznys
asks that you please hurry.</font>

610
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many other buyers are interested.</font>

611
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight thousand dead babies.</font>

612
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Unsullied are a means to an end.</font>

613
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I own them, these men...</font>

614
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not men. Not anymore.</font>

615
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?</font>

616
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think these slaves
will have better lives</font>

617
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">serving men like Kraznys or serving you?</font>

618
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:45,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be fair to them.
You won't mutilate them to make a point.</font>

619
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't order them to murder babies.</font>

620
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.</font>

621
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great injustice has been done to them.</font>

622
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Closing your eyes will not undo it.</font>

623
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">The warlocks.</font>

624
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you my life, ser.</font>

625
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">The honor is mine, my queen.</font>

626
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know this man?</font>

627
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know him</font>

628
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:20,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">as one of the greatest fighters</font>

629
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen</font>

630
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:26,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as the Lord Commander
of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.</font>

631
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert is dead.</font>

632
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:34,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been searching for you, Daenerys
Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.</font>

633
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sworn to protect your family.</font>

634
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed them.</font>

635
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:52,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Barristan Selmy,
Kingsguard to your father.</font>

636
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:57,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow me to join your Queensguard
and I will not fail you again.</font>
