<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, move out!</font>

00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

3
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King in the North!
The King in the North!</font>

4
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

5
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King in the North!
The King in the North!</font>

6
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

7
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

8
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

9
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King in the North!
The King in the North!</font>

10
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the King in the North!</font>

11
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:39,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.</font>

12
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

13
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a list.</font>

14
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">A list of people you mean to kill?</font>

15
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">For laughing at me?
Do I look like Joffrey to you?</font>

16
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, death seems a bit extreme.</font>

17
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear of death, on the other hand...</font>

18
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should learn to ignore them.</font>

19
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, people have been laughing at me</font>

20
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">far longer than they've
been laughing at you.</font>

21
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the half man, the
Demon Monkey, the Imp.</font>

22
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Lannister.</font>

23
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.</font>

24
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.</font>

25
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're perfect for each other.</font>

26
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how should we punish them?</font>

27
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who? Whom?</font>

28
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.</font>

29
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

30
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.</font>

31
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone named
Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.</font>

32
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear that you're a pervert.</font>

33
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the Imp.</font>

34
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have certain standards to maintain.</font>

35
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.</font>

36
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cut a little hole in his mattress</font>

37
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you stuff sheep dung inside.</font>

38
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.</font>

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">His room will stink,
but he won't know where it's coming from.</font>

40
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa!</font>

41
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.</font>

42
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she was always angry with me.</font>

43
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why "sheep shift"?</font>

44
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the vulgar word for "dung."</font>

45
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady...</font>

46
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you asked me.</font>

47
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him!</font>

48
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, my lady.</font>

49
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father has called
a meeting of the Small Council.</font>

50
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killed a few puppies today?</font>

51
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him.</font>

52
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, show him.</font>

53
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

54
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies, my lord. Old fingers.</font>

55
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.</font>

56
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Her brothers gave her
a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."</font>

57
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signed, "Walder Frey."</font>

58
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?</font>

59
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark is dead.</font>

60
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">And his bitch mother.</font>

61
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write back to Lord Frey.</font>

62
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:17,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank him for his service and command
him to send Robb Stark's head.</font>

63
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to
serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.</font>

64
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.</font>

65
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.</font>

66
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did.</font>

67
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to have it
served to Sansa at my wedding feast.</font>

68
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

69
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is no longer yours to torment.</font>

70
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone is mine to torment.</font>

71
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd do well
to remember that, you little monster.</font>

72
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm a monster.</font>

73
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.</font>

74
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:55,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.</font>

75
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have your tongue
out for saying that.</font>

76
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him make his threats.</font>

77
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

78
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a bitter little man.</font>

79
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.</font>

80
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.</font>

81
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the King!</font>

82
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will punish you.</font>

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man who must say,
"I am the King," is no true king.</font>

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make sure you understand that</font>

85
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I've won your war for you.</font>

86
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father won the real war.
He killed Prince Rhaegar.</font>

87
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took the crown
while you hid under Casterly Rock!</font>

88
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King is tired. See him to his chambers.</font>

89
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come along.
- I'm not tired.</font>

90
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have so much to celebrate.</font>

91
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wedding to plan. You must rest.</font>

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grand Maester,
perhaps some essence of nightshade</font>

93
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help him sleep.</font>

94
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not tired!</font>

95
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

96
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you.</font>

97
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just sent the most powerful man</font>

98
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Westeros to bed without his supper.</font>

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fool if you believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.</font>

100
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.</font>

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think a crown gives you power?</font>

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think armies give you power.</font>

104
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

105
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,</font>

106
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you defeated him all the same.</font>

107
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

108
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know.</font>

109
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walder Frey gets all the credit.</font>

110
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.</font>

111
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walder Frey is many
things, but a brave man?</font>

112
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

113
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never would have risked such an action</font>

114
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he didn't have certain assurances.</font>

115
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which he got from me.</font>

116
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you disapprove?</font>

117
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all for cheating. This is war.</font>

118
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to slaughter them at a wedding...</font>

119
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explain to me why it is more noble</font>

120
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.</font>

121
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's why you did it? To save lives?</font>

122
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">To end the war. To protect the family.</font>

123
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?</font>

124
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, write one.</font>

125
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in this world a little while longer</font>

126
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.</font>

127
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Northerners will never forget.</font>

128
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

129
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them remember
what happens when they march on the South.</font>

130

<font color="#FFFFFF">All the Stark men are dead.</font>

131

Warden of the North</font>

134
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.</font>

135
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think she'll open her legs for me</font>

136
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?</font>

137
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.</font>

138
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not rape her.</font>

139
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?</font>

140
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.</font>

141
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house that
puts family first will always defeat</font>

142
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">the house that puts the whims and wishes</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">of its sons and daughters first.</font>

144

<font color="#FFFFFF">regardless of his own selfish desires.</font>

147
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that amuse you?</font>

148
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's a very good lesson.</font>

149
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're making all the decisions.</font>

151
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,877

152
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,331

00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">but solely for the benefit of the family?</font>

154
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day that you were born.</font>

155
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to carry you into the sea</font>

156
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let the waves wash you away.</font>

157
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, I let you live.</font>

158
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I brought you up as my son.</font>

159
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're a Lannister.</font>

160
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa.</font>

161
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's empty-</font>

162
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's find a place to sleep.</font>

163
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

164
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

165
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't, Hodor.</font>

166
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we shouldn't stay here.</font>

167
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd rather be out there?</font>

168
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a lot of stories
about this place.</font>

169
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horrible stories.</font>

170
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always quite liked the horrible stories.</font>

171
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did I. Once.</font>

172
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever heard about the Rat Cook?</font>

173
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Who's he?</font>

174
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a cook in the Night's Watch.</font>

175
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was angry at
the King for something, I don't remember.</font>

176
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the King was visiting the Nightfort,</font>

177
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cook killed the King's son,</font>

178
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:06,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.</font>

179
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">That night he sewed the pie to the King.</font>

180
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.</font>

181
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat</font>

182
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">who could only eat his own young.</font>

183
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been roaming the Nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.</font>

184
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.</font>

185
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Gods turned every killer
into a giant white rat...</font>

186
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">it wasn't for murder
the Gods cursed the Rat Cook</font>

187
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">or for sewing the King's son in a pie.</font>

188
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed a guest beneath his roof.</font>

189
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's something the Gods can't forgive.</font>

190
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me</font>

191
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I didn't get
my men to the Trident in time for battle.</font>

192
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thought he was witty.</font>

193
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at us now, Tully.</font>

194
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,</font>

195
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">your son spent
his wedding night in a dungeon,</font>

196
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm Lord of Riverrun.</font>

197
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Blackfish escaped.</font>

198
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">An old man on the run with no allies.</font>

199
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have Tywin Lannister backing me.</font>

200
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who does he have?</font>

201
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you say.</font>

202
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all laughed at me,
all those high lords.</font>

203
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all thought they were better than me.</font>

204
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.</font>

205
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">People snigger when I marry a young girl,</font>

206
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?</font>

207
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be needing a new young girl.</font>

208
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

209
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got that to look forward to.</font>

210
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

211
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, the Warden of the North.</font>

212
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more Starks to bow and scrape to.</font>

213
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have been torture following that
stupid boy all over the country.</font>

214
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">He ignored my advice at every turn.</font>

215
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...</font>

216
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calling himself
the "Young Wolf." How's that for pomposity?</font>

217
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's to the Young Wolf!</font>

218
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forever young.</font>

219
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?</font>

220
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">At some point perhaps.</font>

221
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Winterfell's in ruins.</font>

222
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

223
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.</font>

224
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:55,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard he killed all the ravens.
And after that, nothing.</font>

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.</font>

226
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn if they gave us Theon.</font>

227
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. And?</font>

228
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ramsay delivered the terms.</font>

229
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:12,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ironborn turned on Theon,
as we knew they would.</font>

230
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">They handed him over trussed and hooded.</font>

231
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Ramsay, well...</font>

232
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ramsay has his own way of doing things.</font>

233
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the girls weren't
lying. You had a good-sized cock.</font>

234
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

235
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

236
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pork sausage.</font>

237
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm some sort of savage?</font>

238
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">People talk about phantom limbs.</font>

239
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">An amputee might
have an itch where his foot used to be.</font>

240
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I've always wondered,</font>

241
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">do eunuchs have a phantom cock?</font>

242
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you think about naked girls,</font>

243
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you feel an itch?</font>

244
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

245
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't make jokes.</font>

246
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother taught me
not to throw stones at cripples.</font>

247
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my father taught me
to aim for their head.</font>

248
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill me.</font>

249
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, what?</font>

250
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill me.</font>

251
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little louder.</font>

252
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill me!</font>

253
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no good to me dead. We need you.</font>

254
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't look like a
Theon Greyjoy anymore.</font>

255
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a name for a lord.</font>

256
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not a lord, are you?</font>

257
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just meat.</font>

258
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stinking meat.</font>

259
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You reek.</font>

260
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reek!</font>

261
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good name for you.</font>

262
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

263
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon Greyjoy.</font>

264
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

265
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon Greyjoy.</font>

266
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

267
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name?</font>

268
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reek.</font>

269
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is...</font>

270
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reek.</font>

271
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

272
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?</font>

273
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?</font>

274
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilly. Don't hurt us.</font>

275
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

276
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Castle Black.
I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.</font>

277
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother, he's in the Night's...</font>

278
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's your brother?
Doesn't matter.</font>

279
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Jon's brother.</font>

280
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one who fell from the window.</font>

281
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not.</font>

282
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been around Ghost
enough to know a direwolf when I see one.</font>

283
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've heard all about Hodor.</font>

284
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

285
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.</font>

286
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.</font>

287
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">And anything I can do to help you, I will.</font>

288
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take us north of the Wall.</font>

289
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why in the world
would you want to go...</font>

290
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to. I have to.</font>

291
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get through the Wall?</font>

292
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the well lead to an underground
river? Is that how you came here?</font>

293
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with us.</font>

294
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are steps carved
into the south side of the Wall.</font>

295
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor can carry you to the top.</font>

296
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll walk straight to Castle Black.</font>

297
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.</font>

298
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Jon is alive,
then Castle Black's where he'll be.</font>

299
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the safest place for you.</font>

300
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nowhere
safe any longer. You know that.</font>

301
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I know is what I saw.</font>

302
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.</font>

303
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw the White Walkers
and the army of the dead.</font>

304
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know all that?</font>

305
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch can't stop them.</font>

306
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.</font>

307
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're going to stop them?</font>

308
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Sam.</font>

309
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go north.</font>

310
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to.</font>

311
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron
Islands and invader of the North.</font>

312
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I give you until the full moon</font>

313
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">"to order all ironborn
scum out of the North</font>

314
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and back to those
shit-stained rocks you call a home.</font>

315
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">"On the first night of the full moon,</font>

316
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I will hunt down every islander</font>

317
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">"still in our lands and flay them living,</font>

318
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:47,737

the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.</font>

322
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,654

or more boxes will follow</font>

323
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,282

and Warden of the North."</font>

326
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get that out of my sight.</font>

327
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon disobeyed my orders.</font>

328
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy is a fool.</font>

329
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">He cannot further the Greyjoy line.</font>

330
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not give up the lands I have seized,</font>

331
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.</font>

332
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's your son.</font>

333
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son?</font>

334
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a man anymore.</font>

335
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's your son. He's my brother.</font>

336
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Greyjoy.</font>

337
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself.</font>

338
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made my decision.</font>

339
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've made mine.</font>

340
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.</font>

341
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.</font>

342
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get those ropes!</font>

343
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,</font>

344
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the way to the Weeping Water.</font>

345
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.</font>

346
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to find my little brother,</font>

347
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm going to bring him home.</font>

348
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

349
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragonglass.</font>

350
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found them at the Fist.</font>

351
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone buried them a long time ago.</font>

352
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone wanted us to find them.</font>

353
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What are they for?</font>

354
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing White Walkers.</font>

355
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

356
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Walker came for my baby.</font>

357
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Sam...</font>

358
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.</font>

359
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.</font>

360
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it, Hodor.</font>

361
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the archer.</font>

362
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got lucky with one of them.</font>

363
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are more.</font>

364
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many more.</font>

365
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for every one of them,</font>

366
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dead men,</font>

367
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than you could count.</font>

368
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you'd come with us.</font>

369
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could.</font>

370
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really do.</font>

371
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you keeping?</font>

372
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. Never better.</font>

373
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just a bit of blood.</font>

374
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have known.</font>

375
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.</font>

376
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not really people to you.</font>

377
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ways to get what you want.</font>

378
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a highborn.</font>

379
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">She called you "Ser."</font>

380
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard it.</font>

381
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">A recent state of affairs.</font>

382
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.</font>

383
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.</font>

384
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived below the Street of Flour.</font>

385
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?</font>

386
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shit that poured from their privy pipes</font>

387
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,</font>

388
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door</font>

389
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.</font>

390
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Street of Steel,
with your armor and your knights?</font>

391
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lived in the fancy part of town.</font>

392
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here we are now.</font>

393
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.</font>

394
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we've come a long way.</font>

395
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all the same, really.</font>

396
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">She went to great pains
to point that out to me.</font>

397
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you mistrust fancy people so much,</font>

398
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">why were you in such a hurry to trust her?</font>

399
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're me.</font>

400
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never been with a woman.</font>

401
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never talked to a woman, really.</font>

402
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then she comes at you,</font>

403
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">big words, no clothes.</font>

404
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you have done?</font>

405
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:09,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.</font>

406
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how'd you become a lord?</font>

407
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. That's a long story.</font>

408
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.</font>

409
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many years ago I helped King
Stannis out of a difficult situation.</font>

410
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He rewarded me with a lordship.</font>

411
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this.</font>

412
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?</font>

413
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Highborns.</font>

414
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.</font>

415
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you?</font>

416
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it for my son.</font>

417
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit</font>

418
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">every time he stepped
through his front door.</font>

419
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted him to have a better life.</font>

420
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he?</font>

421
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

422
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd he die?</font>

423
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Following me.</font>

424
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you come to this strange country?</font>

425
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 13.</font>

426
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were only a child.</font>

427
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped being a child when I was nine.</font>

428
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother made sure of that.</font>

429
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.</font>

430
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,</font>

431
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">gamble away his father's money.</font>

432
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's just the drinking.</font>

433
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm his wife's servant.</font>

434
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brush her hair and clip her
nails and empty her chamber pot.</font>

435
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.</font>

436
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love that girl. I would kill for her.</font>

437
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think that makes it easier for me?</font>

438
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I expect not.</font>

439
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.</font>

440
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:28,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.</font>

441
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.</font>

442
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you let yourself believe</font>

443
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a foreign girl with no name</font>

444
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...</font>

445
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a name.</font>

446
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one name.</font>

447
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">As do I. Here, only the
family name matters.</font>

448
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me, Lord Varys?</font>

449
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diamonds.</font>

450
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,</font>

451
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you know how to protect yourself.</font>

452
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:07,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on one of those
ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.</font>

453
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.</font>

454
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hire servants.</font>

455
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start a new life, a good
life, far from here.</font>

456
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mysterious foreign
beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.</font>

457
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you want me to leave?</font>

458
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive</font>

459
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">who could make this country a better place.</font>

460
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.</font>

461
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you.</font>

462
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a complication.</font>

463
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you love him.</font>

464
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.</font>

465
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not asking you to leave him for money.</font>

466
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking you to leave</font>

467
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">because your presence
in the capital endangers him.</font>

468
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will never be your home, my lady.</font>

469
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find a true home somewhere far from here,</font>

470
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">while there's still time.</font>

471
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Varys.</font>

472
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.</font>

473
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep up.</font>

474
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I can, my lord.</font>

475
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not easy being drunk all the time.</font>

476
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone would do it, if it were easy.</font>

477
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave.</font>

478
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, enjoying married life?</font>

479
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">An unhappy wife
is a wine merchant's best friend.</font>

480
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't deserve this.</font>

481
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deserve?</font>

482
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful with that.</font>

483
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start trying to work out who deserves what,</font>

484
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">and before long you'll spend your days</font>

485
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">weeping for every person in the world.</font>

486
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.</font>

487
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you be facing your
marriage to Ser Loras</font>

488
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the same philosophical spirit?</font>

489
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be marrying Ser Loras.</font>

490
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:38,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seem to remember saying something
similar about my own marriage.</font>

491
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not me.</font>

492
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to make
things better for Sansa? Give her a child.</font>

493
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?</font>

494
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she can have some happiness in her life.</font>

495
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have children.</font>

496
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">How happy would you say you are?</font>

497
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not very.</font>

498
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it weren't for my children,</font>

499
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the Red Keep.</font>

500
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the reason I'm alive.</font>

501
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Joffrey?</font>

502
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Joffrey.</font>

503
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was all I had once.
Before Myrcella was born.</font>

504
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to spend hours looking at him.</font>

505
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">His wisps of hair.</font>

506
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">His tiny little hands and feet.</font>

507
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was such a jolly little fellow.</font>

508
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always hear
the terrible ones were terrible babies.</font>

509
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."</font>

510
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nonsense.</font>

511
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever he was with me, he was happy.</font>

512
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no one can take
that away from me, not even Joffrey,</font>

513
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">how it feels to have someone.</font>

514
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone of your own.</font>

515
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it go on?</font>

516
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until we've dealt with all our enemies.</font>

517
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:39,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time we
deal with an enemy, we create two more.</font>

518
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I suppose
it will go on for quite a long time.</font>

519
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, that's what she did.</font>

520
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounded like a cow in heat.</font>

521
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, not for long.</font>

522
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

523
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black Walder shut her up right quick.</font>

524
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of the Starks
had much to say about the end of that meal.</font>

525
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what, though.</font>

526
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.</font>

527
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sewed it on?</font>

528
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

529
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.</font>

530
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was me.</font>

531
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Malcolm and Talbott.</font>

532
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.</font>

533
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took the skin right with it.</font>

534
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we ended up
having to do was hook the needle</font>

535
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">right under the collarbone,</font>

536
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">give it a nice firm mooring and...</font>

537
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

538
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I keep warm?</font>

539
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off.</font>

540
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm hungry.</font>

541
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does "fuck off" mean
something different where you're from?</font>

542
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got money.</font>

543
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of coin is that?</font>

544
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worth a lot.</font>

545
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

546
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little shit.</font>

547
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fool!</font>

548
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get the knife?</font>

549
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">From you.</font>

550
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the first man you've killed?</font>

551
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first man.</font>

552
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:41,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you're going
to do something like that, tell me first.</font>

553
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Morghulis.</font>

554
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.</font>

555
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always knew who I was, what I am.</font>

556
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go home now.</font>

557
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you won't hurt me.</font>

558
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know nothing, Jon Snow.</font>

559
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do know some things.</font>

560
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I love you.</font>

561
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you love me.</font>

562
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have to go home now.</font>

563
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how this must look.</font>

564
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I meant was...</font>

565
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you, my lord...</font>

566
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a lord, my dear.</font>

567
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for many, many years.</font>

568
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:08,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man who joins the Night's
Watch renounces all former titles.</font>

569
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Among other things.</font>

570
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your name?</font>

571
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilly.</font>

572
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

573
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the gillyflower. Lovely.</font>

574
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my...</font>

575
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester.</font>

576
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master.</font>

577
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester.</font>

578
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the child?</font>

579
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">She hasn't chosen a name yet.</font>

580
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Sam.</font>

581
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarly,</font>

582
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you remember the oath you swore</font>

583
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you joined this order?</font>

584
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not my child, Maester Aemon.</font>

585
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's one of Craster's wives.</font>

586
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember every word of the oath.</font>

587
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Night gathers and my watch begins.</font>

588
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,242

guards the realms of men.</font>

589
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The realms of men."</font>

590
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means her as well as us.</font>

591
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:32,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't build 500 miles
of ice walls 700 feet high to keep out men.</font>

592
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon. I've seen it.</font>

593
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's coming for all of us.</font>

594
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilly, you and your son</font>

595
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be our guests for the time being.</font>

596
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:57,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">We certainly
cannot send you back beyond the Wall.</font>

597
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you...</font>

598
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester.</font>

599
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can cook and clean and I can...</font>

600
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

601
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.</font>

602
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope your penmanship
is better than your swordplay.</font>

603
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miles better.</font>

604
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,141

these boring scrolls.</font>

Balerion the Dread.</font>

he had three dragons.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not need to burn the boy.</font>

662

<font color="#FFFFFF">If what you say is true,</font>

663
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,816

667
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:38,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who
happens to be your nephew.</font>

668

of one bastard boy against a kingdom?</font>

669
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything.</font>

670
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy must die.</font>

671
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.</font>

672
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this some kind of trick?</font>

673
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but not on you.</font>

674
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aim for that star. Don't stop.</font>

675
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's bread and water. Go slow with it.</font>

676
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">don't drink seawater.</font>

678
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know not to drink seawater.</font>

679
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.</font>

680
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.</font>

681
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where should I go?</font>

682
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must keep the coast on your left side</font>

683
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you reach King's Landing.</font>

684
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gold cloaks are looking for me.</font>

685
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were looking for me for 20 years.</font>

686
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do they know your face?
- No.</font>

687
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd worry more about the Red Woman.</font>

688
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other way.</font>

689
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever been in a boat before?</font>

690
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

691
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how to swim?</font>

692
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

693
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fall out. Go on.</font>

694
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing this?</font>

695
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's right.</font>

696
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because I'm a slow learner.</font>

697
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.</font>

698
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horse approaching!</font>

699
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt! Halt!</font>

700
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon! Jon!</font>

701
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon, it's us.</font>

702
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think he can see us.</font>

703
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyp?</font>

704
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam?</font>

705
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hush, now. You're home.</font>

706
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carry him inside. Gently.</font>

707
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of the way.</font>

708
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside, country boy.
People working here.</font>

709
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei.</font>

710
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't deny it?</font>

711
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I let him go.</font>

712
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mercy saved the boy's life.</font>

713
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel good about that?</font>

714
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, I do.</font>

715
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved one innocent.</font>

716
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?</font>

717
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has got to be another way.</font>

718
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What other way?
Tell us about this other way.</font>

719
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Your Grace.</font>

720
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't see the future in the fire.</font>

721
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.</font>

722
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,</font>

725
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

726
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">But since you haven't
yet unnamed me Hand of the King,</font>

727
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is my duty to advise you against it.</font>

728
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna need me.</font>

729
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him away.</font>

730
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I gonna need you?</font>

731
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">My King.</font>

732
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
Their Lord Commander is dead.</font>

733
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.</font>

734
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">One lad did, though.</font>

735
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">What he saw beyond the Wall,
it's coming for all of us.</font>

736
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you learn to read?</font>

737
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matthos taught me before he died,</font>

738
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could be of better service to you.</font>

739
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">This War of Five Kings means nothing.</font>

740
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">The true war lies to the north, my King.</font>

741
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death marches on the Wall.</font>

742
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only you can stop him.</font>

743
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't stop him alone.</font>

744
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need someone to
rebuild your army for you,</font>

745
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone to convince
this lord and that lord to fight for you,</font>

746
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">to bring sellswords and
pirates to your side.</font>

747
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made my decision.</font>

748

750
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.</font>

00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in His army now.</font>

752
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will come, Your Grace.
When they're ready.</font>

753
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.</font>

754
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't conquer them.
