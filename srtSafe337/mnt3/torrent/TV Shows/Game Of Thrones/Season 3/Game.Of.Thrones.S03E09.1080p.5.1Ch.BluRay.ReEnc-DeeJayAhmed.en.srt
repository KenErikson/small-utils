1
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you
sure about this?</font>

2
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

3
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dangerous.</font>

4
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we take Tywin's castle from him,</font>

5
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">the lords of Westerns
will realize he's not invincible.</font>

6
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take his home, take his
gold, take his power.</font>

7
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you telling me?</font>

8
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You begged me not to send Theon</font>

9
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">to negotiate with his father,
and I ignored your advice.</font>

10
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,</font>

11
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">the North is overrun with ironborn,
and Bran and Rickon are gone.</font>

12
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Casterly Rock...</font>

13
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking your advice.</font>

14
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have enough men?</font>

15
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:13,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Walder Frey cooperates.</font>

16
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:23,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">If reinforcements arrive from King's
Landing before we take the castle,</font>

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.</font>

18
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll lose the war and
die the way Father died.</font>

19
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or worse.</font>

20
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.</font>

21
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">My honored guests,</font>

22
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">be welcome within my walls and at my table.</font>

23
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I extend to you my hospitality</font>

24
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">and protection in the light of the Seven.</font>

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.</font>

26
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:46,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have come to make my apologies, my
lord, and to beg your forgiveness.</font>

27
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.</font>

28
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.</font>

29
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them was supposed to be queen.</font>

30
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now none of them are.</font>

31
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Arwyn, my daughter.</font>

32
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter Walda, my daughter Denna,</font>

33
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">my daughter Waldra.</font>

34
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:33,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.</font>

35
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:39,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.</font>

36
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have had either.</font>

37
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could have had both, for all I care.</font>

38
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">My granddaughter Marianne.</font>

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">My granddaughter Freya.</font>

40
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">My granddaughter...</font>

41
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wertha.</font>

42
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waldra.</font>

43
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waldina.</font>

44
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Merry.</font>

45
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

46
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">And herds my youngest daughter Shirei,</font>

47
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">though she hasn't bled yet.</font>

48
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.</font>

49
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">My ladies.</font>

50
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">All men should
keep their word, kings most of all.</font>

51
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was pledged to
marry one of you and I broke that vow.</font>

52
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fault is not with you.</font>

53
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man would be lucky
to have any one of you.</font>

54
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I did not to slight
you, but because I loved another.</font>

55
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know these words cannot set right</font>

56
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">the wrong I have done
to you and your house.</font>

57
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your forgiveness</font>

58
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:48,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pledge to do all I can to make
amends so the Freys of the Crossing</font>

59
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Starks of Winterfell
may once again befriends.</font>

60
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good.</font>

61
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is.</font>

62
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come closer. Let me have a look at you.</font>

63
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still can't see you.</font>

64
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old eyes.</font>

65
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love.</font>

66
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what the Starks of
Winterfell call it, eh?</font>

67
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very honorable. I call it a pretty face.</font>

68
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

69
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very pretty.</font>

70
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.</font>

71
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very shapely as well.</font>

72
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.</font>

73
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanted to hide her,</font>

74
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">you shouldn't have
brought her here in the first place.</font>

75
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can always see
what's going on beneath a dress.</font>

76
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been at this a longtime.</font>

77
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet when you take that dress off,</font>

78
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything stays right where it is.</font>

79
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't drop an inch.</font>

80
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your king says he betrayed me for love.</font>

81
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say he betrayed
me for firm tits and a tight fit.</font>

82
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can respect that.</font>

83
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was your age, I'd
have broken 50 oaths</font>

84
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">to gel into that without a second thought.</font>

85
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.</font>

86
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:03,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll set up tents outside
with food and ale for the rest of your men.</font>

87
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my lord.</font>

88
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's get ready.</font>

89
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wine will flow red</font>

90
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the music will play loud</font>

91
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll put this mess behind us.</font>

92
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

93
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

94
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. It's a back gate.</font>

95
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">My men use it
when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.</font>

96
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your men, but not you?</font>

97
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no interest in slaves.</font>

98
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man cannot make love to property.</font>

99
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where we enter
the city. Very few guards. They know me.</font>

100
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">They let me inside...</font>

101
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna
sneak an army through a back gate.</font>

102
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kill the guards.</font>

103
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take your two best men</font>

104
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,</font>

105
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">and open the front gates.</font>

106
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then comes the army.</font>

107
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.</font>

108
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,</font>

109
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">cutting the head off our army.</font>

110
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee</font>

111
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't have to split it three ways</font>

112
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.</font>

113
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a very suspicious mind.</font>

114
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my experience,
only dishonest people think this way.</font>

115
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You command the Unsullied.</font>

116
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you think?</font>

117
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a leader now.</font>

118
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you trust him?</font>

119
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust him.</font>

120
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You leave tonight.</font>

121
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good. We'll prepare.</font>

122
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Jorah.</font>

123
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can use an extra sword.</font>

124
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen.</font>

125
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we are truly her loyal servants,</font>

126
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll do whatever needs to be done,</font>

127
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter the cost, no matter our pride.</font>

128
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're west of Castle Black,</font>

129
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the Nightfort's closest to us.</font>

130
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the first castle on the Wall.</font>

131
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Watch abandoned it
during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.</font>

132
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too big. Impossible to maintain.</font>

133
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Other than Castle Black itself,</font>

134
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.</font>

135
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:48,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got a secret sally port,
the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.</font>

136
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's used it in centuries, most likely.</font>

137
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">It leads through
the Wall right down into the Nightfort,</font>

138
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">if one knows how to find it,
which, it just so happens, I do.</font>

139
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know all that?</font>

140
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read about it in a very old book.</font>

141
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:23,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know all that
from staring at marks on paper?</font>

142
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

143
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a wizard.</font>

144
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our father used to tell us</font>

145
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.</font>

146
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are.</font>

147
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alive.</font>

148
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what happens to children who run.</font>

149
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your father and I'll do the talking.</font>

150
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">The roads have gone right to hell.</font>

151
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cracked three spokes this morning.</font>

152
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need a hand?</font>

153
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need about eight hands.</font>

154
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

155
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to get this salt pork to the
Twins in time for the wedding.</font>

156
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many thanks.</font>

157
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't! Don't kill him.</font>

158
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead rats don't squeak.</font>

159
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so dangerous, aren't you?</font>

160
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saying scary things to little girls.</font>

161
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing little boys and old people.
A real hard man you are.</font>

162
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than anyone you know.</font>

163
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong.</font>

164
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a killer.</font>

165
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A real killer.
- That so?</font>

166
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd
kill you with his little finger.</font>

167
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">That him?</font>

168
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Good.</font>

169
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't kill him.</font>

170
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

171
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't.</font>

172
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very kind. Someday
it'll get you killed.</font>

173
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we?</font>

174
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gift, I think.</font>

175
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brandon the Builder gave all this land</font>

176
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">south of the Wall to the Night's Watch</font>

177
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">for their sustenance and support.</font>

178
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester Luwin taught me that.</font>

179
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.</font>

180
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good land, and there's no war up here.</font>

181
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why leave?</font>

182
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildlings.</font>

183
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

184
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they come over
the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.</font>

185
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup</font>

186
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make you drink your own blood from it.</font>

187
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Old Nan said.</font>

188
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a storm coming.</font>

189
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see any.</font>

190
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as good a place to shelter as any.</font>

191
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can drink some blood while we wait.</font>

192
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need much.</font>

193
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one old man
and eight good horses.</font>

194
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's one old man doing
with eight horses?</font>

195
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">He breeds them for the Watch.</font>

196
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's he keep folks from stealing them?</font>

197
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Watch protects him.</font>

198
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not today, they don't.</font>

199
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.</font>

200
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">And proper steel.</font>

201
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's carve him up.</font>

202
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just take the horses and go.</font>

203
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old man's no threat.</font>

204
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep telling you.</font>

205
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an old man. A spear through
the heart's a better way to die</font>

206
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">than coughing up your
last with no one but your horses to hear.</font>

207
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Watch might send
a few men looking for a horse thief.</font>

208
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.</font>

209
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:42,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope so.
Killing crows in their castle is tough.</font>

210
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing them out
here in the open, that's what we do.</font>

211
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.</font>

212
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte!</font>

213
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear the barn!</font>

214
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's going to believe
you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.</font>

215
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best part of the animal.</font>

216
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. They're still there.</font>

217
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they're still there.</font>

218
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You check every five minutes
like you're afraid they're gonna move.</font>

219
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid.</font>

220
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are.</font>

221
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're almost there
and you're afraid you won't make it.</font>

222
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">The closer you gel, the
worse the fear gets.</font>

223
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">No point in trying to
hide behind that face.</font>

224
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know fear when I see it.</font>

225
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seen it a lot.</font>

226
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew fear when I saw it in you.</font>

227
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid of fire.</font>

228
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Beric's sword went up in flames,</font>

229
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">you looked like a scared little girl.</font>

230
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know why, too.</font>

231
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard what your brother did to you.</font>

232
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pressed your face to the fire like
you're a nice juicy mutton chop.</font>

233
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">That give you some ideas?</font>

234
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might do.</font>

235
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, then. You might get away.</font>

236
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might even make it there on your own.</font>

237
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just over the river.</font>

238
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,360

<font color="#FFFFFF">your eye and out the back of your skull.</font>

242
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we going to get past the Wall?</font>

243
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle said it's 700 feel high.</font>

244
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get past it?</font>

245
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.</font>

246
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.</font>

247
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some climb straight up the ice.</font>

248
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Hodor's not strong enough to</font>

249
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">climb the Wall with me on his back.</font>

250
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

251
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nineteen castles guard the Wall.</font>

252
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only three are still manned.</font>

253
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hodor!</font>

254
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of those abandoned
fortresses will give us a way through.</font>

255
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle said the gates
were sealed with ice</font>

256
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stone when the castles were deserted.</font>

257
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll have to open them up again.</font>

258
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

259
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a rider out there.</font>

260
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just one?</font>

261
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,419

00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just thunder, sweet giant.</font>

263
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

264
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,563

271
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hush, Hodor. No... No more Hodoring.</font>

272
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor!</font>

273
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.</font>

274
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.</font>

275
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor, be quiet.</font>

276
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hodor!

278
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor, be quiet!</font>

279
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?</font>

280
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

281
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

282
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

283
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a horse dying.</font>

284
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring them over here.</font>

285
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was
the last of them. The rest are dead.</font>

286
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard shouting up there.</font>

287
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thunder.</font>

288
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.</font>

289
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's ghosts.</font>

290
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">That won't help you, grandpa.</font>

291
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you riding?</font>

292
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter now, does it?</font>

293
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it doesn't matter now.</font>

294
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut his throat,
or he'll tell the crows we're here.</font>

295
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand.</font>

296
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me stand at least.</font>

297
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go with a bit of dignity.</font>

298
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make the crow kill him.</font>

299
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one of us now. Prove it.</font>

300
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolves are out there.</font>

301
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do it by choice.</font>

302
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how.</font>

303
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happens in my dreams.</font>

304
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.</font>

305
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:20,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

306
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just did, with him.</font>

307
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wolf is nothing compared to that.</font>

308
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks sharp.</font>

309
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

310
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

311
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you. He's still one of them.</font>

312
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, boy.</font>

313
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on!</font>

314
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a crow. He'll always be a crow.</font>

315
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here's his crow wife guarding him.</font>

316
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.</font>

317
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill him.</font>

318
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's one of them.</font>

319
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

320
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me? Ahh!</font>

321
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna die for one of them.</font>

322
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

323
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll find us if you don't.</font>

324
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right the whole time.</font>

325
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you hear
a songbird's whistle, you come.</font>

326
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a great whistler. The
greatest in the land.</font>

327
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daario Naharis.</font>

328
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one was quick.</font>

329
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There may be others.
- I doubt it.</font>

330
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.</font>

331
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you call a few guards?</font>

332
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! What do you got, huh?</font>

333
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Edmure,</font>

334
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.</font>

335
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a delight to me, my lady.</font>

336
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may now cloak the bride and
bring her under your protection.</font>

337
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:33,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the sight of the Seven,
I hereby seal these two souls,</font>

338
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">binding them as one for eternity.</font>

339
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look upon each other and say the words.</font>

340
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Father, Smith...
- Father, Smith...</font>

341
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... Warrior, Mother...
- ... Warrior, Mother...</font>

342
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... Maiden, Crone, Stranger.
- ... Maiden, Crone, Stranger.</font>

343
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am hers...
- I am his...</font>

344
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... and she is mine...
- ... and he is mine...</font>

345
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">from this day
until the end of my days.</font>

346
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that safe?</font>

347
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're long gone.</font>

348
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

349
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get inside
Summers mind whenever I want.</font>

350
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you can.</font>

351
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">North of the Wall there are wildlings</font>

352
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">who can control all sons of animals.</font>

353
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you did a lot more than that.</font>

354
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got inside Hodor's mind.</font>

355
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't do that north of the Wall?</font>

356
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can do that. Anywhere.</font>

357
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was looking through Summer's eyes,</font>

358
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw Jon.
Where?</font>

359
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was with the wildlings.</font>

360
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tried to kill him, but he got away.</font>

361
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be heading back
to Castle Black, then.</font>

362
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where we should go.</font>

363
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all we know,
Castle Black's already under attack.</font>

364
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this many wildlings got through...</font>

365
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already told you.</font>

366
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going north of the Wall.</font>

367
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything Jojen told me is true.</font>

368
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what I did to Hodor.</font>

369
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to find the three-eyed raven.</font>

370
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, little lord.</font>

371
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

372
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not asking you to come with me.</font>

373
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't be safe for Rickon.</font>

374
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? I'm coming with you.</font>

375
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

376
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.</font>

377
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.</font>

378
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:40,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming with you.
I'm your brother. I have to protect you.</font>

379
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now I have to protect you.</font>

380
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.</font>

381
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">If something happens to us,
you're the heir to Winterfell.</font>

382
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you know how to
find the Last Hearth?</font>

383
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Southerners
build your big castles and you never move.</font>

384
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're easy to find.</font>

385
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not Southerners.</font>

386
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't want to leave you.</font>

387
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

388
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here, little soldier.</font>

389
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and me,
we're gonna have some adventures.</font>

390
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do any of this.</font>

391
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your family took me in
and was good to me without cause.</font>

392
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be fine, you and me.</font>

393
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Umbers are great warriors. Even I
heard about them growing up.</font>

394
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll teach you how to swing a sword.</font>

395
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to swing a sword.</font>

396
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.</font>

397
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned to walk in darkness.</font>

398
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say your good-byes, little man.</font>

399
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep this one safe.</font>

400
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">He means the world to me.</font>

401
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been waiting a longtime.</font>

402
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't we?</font>

403
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know, you tell me.</font>

404
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it take to sack a city?</font>

405
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just as you said.</font>

406
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did not believe until it was too late.</font>

407
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their slave soldiers
threw down their spears and surrendered.</font>

408
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Daario Naharis?</font>

409
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city is yours, my queen.</font>

410
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're good, aren't they?</font>

411
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">They ought to be because they cost enough.</font>

412
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the crowd there.</font>

413
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">He complained about this marriage</font>

414
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">the entire ride from Riverrun,</font>

415
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now look at him.</font>

416
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gods love to reward a fool.</font>

417
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uncle.
- What?</font>

418
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:28,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's my nephew. I love him.
And he's a damned fool.</font>

419
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?</font>

420
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.</font>

421
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the point.</font>

422
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?</font>

423
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. Lord Walder
let me choose any of his granddaughters</font>

424
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">and promised me
the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.</font>

425
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I have a fat young bride.</font>

426
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope she makes you very happy.</font>

427
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she's made me very rich.</font>

428
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:03,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon, my lord,
my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.</font>

429
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.</font>

430
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.</font>

431
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:16,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be kind. She's finally
starting to like you.</font>

432
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I like her.</font>

433
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis</font>

434
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">playing my harp
and you would be sitting over there,</font>

435
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">eating blackberries out
of Roslin Frey's hand.</font>

436
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.</font>

437
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Striking your king is an act of treason.</font>

438
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:41,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't.</font>

439
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't insult them.</font>

440
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

441
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:00,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">The septon has prayed his prayers,</font>

442
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">some words were said,</font>

443
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Lord Edmure
has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.</font>

444
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they are not yet man and wife.</font>

445
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sword needs a sheath.</font>

446
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a wedding needs a bedding.</font>

447
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does my sire say?</font>

448
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">To bed! To bed! To bed!</font>

449
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think the time is right,
Lord Welder, by all means,</font>

450
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">let us bed them.</font>

451
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">To bed! To bed! To bed!</font>

452
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

453
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho-ho!</font>

454
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful now, ladies.</font>

455
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you set that monster free,</font>

456
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's no caging him again.</font>

457
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">To bed! To bed! To bed!</font>

458
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor girl.</font>

459
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every bride suffers the same.</font>

460
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you endured yours with grace.</font>

461
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Ned forbade it.</font>

462
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it wouldn't be right if he broke
a man's jaw on our wedding night.</font>

463
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a very strange custom.</font>

464
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it does seem strange
from a foreigner's perspective.</font>

465
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems normal to you?</font>

466
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:03,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a tradition.</font>

467
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof</font>

468
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.</font>

469
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.</font>

470
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy or girl?</font>

471
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

472
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it's a boy,
I know what we should name him.</font>

473
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, do you?</font>

474
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.</font>

475
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddard.</font>

476
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:41,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to
leach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?</font>

477
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

478
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, line 'em up!</font>

479
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

480
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

481
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got salt pork for the feast.</font>

482
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">The feast is over.</font>

483
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't sound like it's over.</font>

484
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I tell you it's over, it's over.</font>

485
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.</font>

486
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got pig's feet, too.</font>

487
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you soft in the head?
Turn this can around.</font>

488
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

489
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:52,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel I've been remiss in my duties.</font>

490
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:56,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've given you meat and wine and music,</font>

491
00:43:56,234 --> 00:44:01,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I haven't shown you
the hospitality you deserve.</font>

492
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">My king has married
and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.</font>

493
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb!</font>

494
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

495
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ahh!</font>

496
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

497
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?</font>

498
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feast over yet, is it?</font>

499
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, it's over.</font>

500
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aim!</font>

501
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late.</font>

502
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King in the North arises.</font>

503
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Walder!</font>

504
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Walder, enough!</font>

505
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it end!</font>

506
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:37,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. He is my son.</font>

507
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">My first son.</font>

508
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him go,
and I swear that we will forget this.</font>

509
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it by the Old Gods and New.</font>

510
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will take no vengeance.</font>

511
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already swore me
one oath right here in my castle.</font>

512
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore by all the Gods
your son would marry my daughter!</font>

513
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:57,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me
for a hostage, but let Robb go.</font>

514
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb, gel up. Get up and walk out.</font>

515
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

516
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

517
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:12,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would I let him do that?</font>

518
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">On my honor as a Tully,</font>

519
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">on my honor as a Stark,</font>

520
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:26,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">let him go, or I will
out your wife's throat.</font>

521
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find another.</font>

522
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother.</font>

523
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters send their regards.</font>
