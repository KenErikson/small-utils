1
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think too much, Bran.</font>

2
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax your bow arm.</font>

3
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?</font>

4
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father?</font>

5
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't kill it, you know.</font>

6
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

7
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the raven is you.</font>

8
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

9
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, Hodor.</font>

10
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

11
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you
inside the wolf again, little lord?</font>

12
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it was the three-eyed raven.</font>

13
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's back.</font>

14
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.</font>

15
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There was a boy.
I don't want to hear about it.</font>

16
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.</font>

17
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.</font>

18
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask for black magic dreams.</font>

19
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you didn't, little lord.</font>

20
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to move. We don't know
who might be after us.</font>

21
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one knows we're alive.</font>

22
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who told you that?</font>

23
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">The three-eyed raven tell you?</font>

24
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Some good he is, then.</font>

25
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what people know and don't.</font>

26
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only know the Wall is a long way off.</font>

27
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother always
told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.</font>

28
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grim, bearded,</font>

29
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">stinking barbarians
that would row across the Narrow Sea</font>

30
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:49,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">and steal us from our beds.</font>

31
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever think you'd marry one?</font>

32
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.</font>

33
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never?</font>

34
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:03,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until I met the king
of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.</font>

35
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, Your Grace.</font>

36
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">My queen.</font>

37
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton.</font>

38
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess which is the good news.</font>

39
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.</font>

40
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't seen him in years.</font>

41
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know how many.</font>

42
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll travel to the funeral together.</font>

43
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.</font>

44
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?</font>

45
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something else?</font>

46
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before Bolton's bastard got to
Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.</font>

47
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">They massacred everyone
and put the castle to the torch.</font>

48
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Bran and Rickon have not been found.</font>

49
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:17,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">They may have escaped.</font>

50
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Theon may have taken
them to the Iron Islands as hostages.</font>

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you received any demands?</font>

52
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

53
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you heard anything from Theon at all?</font>

54
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

55
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

56
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

57
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to do this.</font>

58
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how
long it'll take to get to King's Landing</font>

59
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">walking through fields and forests?</font>

60
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

61
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">How shall we pass the time?</font>

62
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">By putting one foot in front of the other.</font>

63
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be a very dull walk.</font>

64
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to take you to King's Landing</font>

65
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.</font>

66
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dull is fine.</font>

67
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,</font>

68
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.</font>

69
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me on this.</font>

70
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have been serving me
since I was born.</font>

71
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think Lady Stark
is going to want a giant towheaded plank</font>

72
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">following her around for the rest of her life?</font>

73
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">A week's journey with you
and she'll order you to fall on your sword.</font>

74
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Lady Stark is
unhappy with any aspect of my service,</font>

75
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she'll let me know.
She's an honest woman.</font>

76
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all the good it's done her.</font>

77
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you come into Lady Stark's service?</font>

78
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something we can talk about.</font>

79
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not your concern, Kingslayer.</font>

80
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had to be recently.
You weren't with her at Winterfell.</font>

81
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you know?</font>

82
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I visited Winterfell.</font>

83
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have noticed your dour
head smacking into the archways.</font>

84
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move.</font>

85
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.</font>

86
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Renly. Really?</font>

87
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't fit to rule over anything</font>

88
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">more important than a 12-course meal.</font>

89
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut your mouth.
- Why?</font>

90
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived with him at
court since he was a boy, don't forget.</font>

91
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could hardly escape the little tulip.</font>

92
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.</font>

93
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew him better than you.</font>

94
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew him as well as anyone.</font>

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a member of his Kingsguard,
he trusted me with everything.</font>

96
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would have been a wonderful king.</font>

97
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like you quite fancied him.</font>

98
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not fancy him.</font>

99
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Gods, you did.</font>

100
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever tell him? No, of course not.</font>

101
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.</font>

102
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.</font>

103
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're far too much man for him.</font>

104
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in foul rumors.</font>

105
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless they're about me.</font>

106
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all true about Renly.</font>

107
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">His proclivities
were the worst kept secret at court.</font>

108
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shame
the throne isn't made out of cocks.</font>

109
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd have never got him off it.</font>

110
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut your mouth!</font>

111
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't blame him.
And I don't blame you, either.</font>

112
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't get to choose who we love.</font>

113
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you headed, then?</font>

114
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">South.</font>

115
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You?
- Riverrun.</font>

116
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Staying off the King's Road, are you?</font>

117
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get you no matter where you go.</font>

118
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't win.</font>

119
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you really can't.</font>

120
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you're safe enough.</font>

121
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meaning no offense, my lady, but
I wouldn't tangle with you.</font>

122
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.</font>

123
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows who I am.</font>

124
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't.</font>

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're right.
What if you're not? What if he tells someone?</font>

126
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not doing it.</font>

127
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an innocent man.</font>

128
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?</font>

129
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it tighter here.</font>

130
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. That's better.</font>

131
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes you look very strong.</font>

132
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">No flowers.</font>

133
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said no flowers.</font>

134
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these are wrong. Bring others.</font>

135
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace.</font>

136
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody flowers. On the king.</font>

137
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like a Tyrell rose.
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.</font>

138
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should be more than enough fabric.</font>

139
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what you think of her.</font>

140
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

141
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaery.</font>

142
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's an ideal match.</font>

143
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the Tyrells beside us,
we'll crush the Northerners.</font>

144
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:46,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang their lords, burn their
strongholds, sow their fields with salt,</font>

145
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no one will think
of rebelling for another century.</font>

146
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a good match,
but what do you think of her?</font>

147
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's beautiful and intelligent.</font>

148
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she is.</font>

149
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her concern with the well-being</font>

150
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the common people is interesting.</font>

151
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to me.</font>

152
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only meant
to go out of your way to endanger...</font>

153
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is becoming one of the
most boring conversations I've ever had.</font>

154
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.</font>

155
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">She dresses like a harlot for a reason.</font>

156
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Married a traitor and known degenerate</font>

157
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">like Renly Baratheon for a reason.</font>

158
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.</font>

159
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what
intelligent women do. What they're told.</font>

160
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to ask yourself...</font>

161
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to do anything.</font>

162
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better.</font>

163
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much better.</font>

164
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't believe it.</font>

165
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't want anything.</font>

166
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.</font>

167
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.</font>

168
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger's not in love with me.</font>

169
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love is not the thing he wants.</font>

170
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's too old.</font>

171
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never see it that way.</font>

172
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't ask you to do something for him?</font>

173
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spy on someone or...</font>

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

175
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:52,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he does ask you for anything or try anything</font>

176
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">or touch you, I want you to tell me.</font>

177
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What will you do?</font>

178
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will make him stop.</font>

179
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</font>

180
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send him in.</font>

181
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa.</font>

182
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras.</font>

183
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister invites you
to take the air with her and our grandmother,</font>

184
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Lady Olenna, in the gardens.</font>

185
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I escort you to them?</font>

186
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you
grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.</font>

187
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are too kind, Ser Loras.</font>

188
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably don't remember
the first time we met.</font>

189
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.</font>

190
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rose, a red rose.</font>

191
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I did.</font>

192
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more your color. You take it.</font>

193
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

194
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such a dear.</font>

195
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take my leave.</font>

196
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa.</font>

197
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Ser Loras.</font>

198
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

199
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:23,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa, it is my honor
to present my grandmother.</font>

200
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.</font>

201
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kiss me, child.</font>

202
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:33,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so good of you
to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.</font>

203
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're very sorry for your losses.</font>

204
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was sorry when
I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.</font>

205
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was very gallant.
Yes.</font>

206
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">And charming and very clean.</font>

207
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew how to dress
and smile and somehow</font>

208
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.</font>

209
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.</font>

210
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father liked him and so did Loras.</font>

211
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras is young and good
at knocking men off horses with a stick.</font>

212
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">That does not make him wise.</font>

213
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">As to your fathead father...</font>

214
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?</font>

215
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">She might think we have some wits about
us. One of us, at any rate.</font>

216
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was treason. I warned them.</font>

217
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert has two sons
and Renly has an older brother.</font>

218
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can he possibly have any
claim to that ugly iron chair?</font>

219
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have stayed
well out of all this if you ask me.</font>

220
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">But once the cow's been milked, there's no</font>

221
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">squirting the cream back up her udders.</font>

222
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here we are to see things through.</font>

223
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say to that, Sansa?</font>

224
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we have some lemon cakes?</font>

225
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lemon cake's my favorite.</font>

226
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we've been told.</font>

227
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to bring the food</font>

228
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">or do you mean to starve us to death?</font>

229
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Sansa, come sit with me.</font>

230
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm much less boring than these others.</font>

231
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know my son?</font>

232
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Highgarden?</font>

233
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had the pleasure.</font>

234
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. No great
pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf.</font>

235
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:05,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">His father was an oaf
as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor.</font>

236
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.</font>

237
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he was looking up at the sky</font>

238
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">and paying no mind
to where his horse was taking him.</font>

239
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now my son is doing the same,</font>

240
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">only this time
he's riding a lion instead of a horse.</font>

241
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

242
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to tell me the truth</font>

243
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">about this royal boy, this Joffrey.</font>

244
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I...</font>

245
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, you. Who else would know better?</font>

246
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:39,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've heard some
troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?</font>

247
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has this boy mistreated you?
Has he ripped out your tongue?</font>

248
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:51,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey,
His Grace is very fair and handsome</font>

249
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as brave as a lion.</font>

250
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, all Lannisters are lions.</font>

251
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.</font>

252
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how kind is he? How clever?</font>

253
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?</font>

254
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.</font>

255
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me some cheese.</font>

256
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.</font>

257
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cheese will be served
when I want it served.</font>

258
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want it served now.</font>

259
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you frightened, child? No need for that.</font>

260
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:37,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're only women here.
Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.</font>

261
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father always told the truth.</font>

262
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:46,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he had that reputation.
And they named him traitor and took his head.</font>

263
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey.</font>

264
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey did that.</font>

265
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">He promised he would be merciful</font>

266
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he cut my father's head off.</font>

267
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he said that was mercy.</font>

268
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he took me
up on the walls and made me look at it.</font>

269
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

270
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. I never meant...</font>

271
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was a traitor.</font>

272
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.</font>

273
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't make me say any more.</font>

274
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's terrified, Grandmother. Look at her.</font>

275
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak freely, child.</font>

276
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">We would never
betray your confidence, I swear it.</font>

277
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a monster.</font>

278
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:32,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

279
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a pity.</font>

280
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, don't stop the wedding.</font>

281
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden</font>

282
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">is determined that Margaery shall be queen.</font>

283
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even so, we thank you for the truth.</font>

284
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

285
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes my cheese.</font>

286
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at war.
This march is a distraction.</font>

287
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandfather's
funeral is not a distraction.</font>

288
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?</font>

289
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

290
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's a distraction.</font>

291
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Uncle Edmure
has his forces garrisoned there.</font>

292
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need his men.</font>

293
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless he's been breeding them,</font>

294
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">he don't have enough to make a difference.</font>

295
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you lost faith in our cause?</font>

296
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.</font>

297
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you no longer believe...</font>

298
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can believe till it snows in Dorne.</font>

299
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.</font>

300
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think we can win?</font>

301
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I speak my mind, Your Grace?</font>

302
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you not been
speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?</font>

303
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:56,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you lost this war
the day you married her.</font>

304
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Whoa!</font>

305
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

306
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid of her.</font>

307
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she knows it.</font>

308
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid of her.</font>

309
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I help you, Lady Stark?</font>

310
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

311
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...</font>

312
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't help because a mother</font>

313
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes one for her children to protect them.</font>

314
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a mother can make them.</font>

315
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've made them before?</font>

316
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice.</font>

317
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they work?</font>

318
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a fashion.</font>

319
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:07,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.</font>

320
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:15,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.</font>

321
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester Luwin said
if he made it through the night, he'd live.</font>

322
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it would be a very long night.</font>

323
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I sat with him all through the darkness.</font>

324
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listened to his ragged little breaths.</font>

325
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">His coughing, his whimpering.</font>

326
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which boy?</font>

327
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon Snow.</font>

328
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:50,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my husband brought that baby home
from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.</font>

329
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to see those brown</font>

330
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">stranger's eyes staring up at me.</font>

331
00:22:55,291 --> 00:23:00,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I prayed to the Gods,
take him away. Make him die.</font>

332
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got the pox.</font>

333
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.</font>

334
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">A murderer.</font>

335
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death</font>

336
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">all because I was jealous of his mother.</font>

337
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman he didn't even know.</font>

338
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I prayed to all seven Gods,</font>

339
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">let the boy live.</font>

340
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him live and I'll love him.</font>

341
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be a mother to him.</font>

342
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,</font>

343
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">to call him Stark and be done with it,</font>

344
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make him one of us.</font>

345
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:55,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he lived.</font>

346
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I couldn't keep my promise.</font>

347
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everything that's happened since then,</font>

348
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">all this horror that's come to my family,</font>

349
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.</font>

350
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?</font>

351
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

352
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You liked him?</font>

353
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you, but if you're playing us false,</font>

354
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">it won't be hard for me to kill you.</font>

355
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got wildling
blood in my veins. These are my people.</font>

356
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

357
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how could you understand?</font>

358
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to protect your people.</font>

359
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,</font>

360
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:00,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">half of whom want to massacre the other
half for one insult or another?</font>

361
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:04,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">They speak seven
different languages in my army.</font>

362
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:08,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The
Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.</font>

363
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone hates the cave people.</font>

364
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:16,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know how I got moon
worshippers and cannibals and giants</font>

365
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">to march together in the same army?</font>

366
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

367
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:25,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them we
were all going to die if we don't get south.</font>

368
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's the truth.</font>

369
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't be long now.</font>

370
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with him?</font>

371
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a warg.</font>

372
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can enter
the mind of animals, see through their eyes.</font>

373
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's scouting for us.</font>

374
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you've never met a warg?</font>

375
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orell.</font>

376
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you this time?</font>

377
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fist of the First Men.</font>

378
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see?</font>

379
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead crows.</font>

380
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter, Piggy?
You crying 'cause you're cold?</font>

381
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's 200 brothers killed by dead men</font>

382
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're still here</font>

383
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">whimpering.</font>

384
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">That seem fair to you?</font>

385
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:17,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting
while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.</font>

386
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?</font>

387
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know you want to.</font>

388
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

389
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, Sam.</font>

390
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

391
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

392
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

393
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you stop, you'll die.</font>

394
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.</font>

395
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't care.</font>

396
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course we care.</font>

397
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left me.</font>

398
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the White Walkers came,
you left me.</font>

399
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:13,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow.</font>

400
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't want to die.</font>

401
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me get him up.</font>

402
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like that piggy is done for.</font>

403
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help us get him up.</font>

404
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's slowing us down.</font>

405
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get him up!</font>

406
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? So the rest of us can die?</font>

407
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll move faster without him.</font>

408
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this? Get up, Tarly.</font>

409
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he all right?</font>

410
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, I think so.</font>

411
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We may as well just go without him.
- That's enough.</font>

412
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarly, I forbid you to die.</font>

413
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

414
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should the rest of us...</font>

415
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rast, you're responsible for him.</font>

416
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I supposed to do?</font>

417
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure he gets back alive.</font>

418
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he doesn't, you don't.</font>

419
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move on!</font>

420
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:17,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?</font>

421
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Rickon and Hodor?</font>

422
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking for food.</font>

423
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's out there?</font>

424
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not another step, boy.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.</font>

425
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm unarmed.</font>

426
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was poor planning.</font>

427
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister carries the weapons.</font>

428
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm better with them.</font>

429
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the spear.</font>

430
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it.</font>

431
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.</font>

432
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Summer.</font>

433
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:47,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera.</font>

434
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.</font>

435
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have much farther to go.</font>

436
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to understand.</font>

437
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please shut up about it?</font>

438
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.</font>

439
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not listening.</font>

440
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just explain it to me.</font>

441
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:14,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">He offered to kill
any three people you wanted. Dead.</font>

442
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you had to do
was give him the names. Anyone.</font>

443
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have picked King Joffrey.</font>

444
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

445
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have picked Tywin Lannister.</font>

446
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaqen got us out
of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?</font>

447
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you could have ended the war.</font>

448
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we going?</font>

449
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">North.</font>

450
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.</font>

451
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we passed it.</font>

452
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 100 feet wide.
How could we have passed it?</font>

453
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we hit the Red Fork,
we can follow it west to Riverrun.</font>

454
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:46,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother grew up there.
My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.</font>

455
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could be a minstrel.
- Shut up.</font>

456
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">A minstrel's got gold sometimes.</font>

457
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could jump him,
tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.</font>

458
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

459
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:07,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so he spoke, and so he spoke</font>

460
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">That lord of Castamere</font>

461
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:15,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now the rains weep o'er his hall</font>

462
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:18,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">With no one there to hear</font>

463
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's
lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?</font>

464
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a dirty little cub, I think.</font>

465
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loose a few more shafts.
- Don't.</font>

466
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the sword down, girl.</font>

467
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go on down the road.
Keep singing so we know where you are.</font>

468
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us be and I won't kill you.</font>

469
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Generous.</font>

470
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a dangerous person.</font>

471
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like dangerous people.</font>

472
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are your friends so shy?</font>

473
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">What friends?</font>

474
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.</font>

475
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:42,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three young ones
on the run carrying castle-forged swords.</font>

476
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You escape from Harrenhal?</font>

477
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

478
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thoros of Myr.</font>

479
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fellow with the bow is Anguy.</font>

480
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, who do you fight for?</font>

481
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Brotherhood Without Banners.</font>

482
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now come along.</font>

483
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to hear how two boys
and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.</font>

484
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood?</font>

485
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who the Mountain were looking for.</font>

486
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll bring us back and put rats in us.</font>

487
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got nothing to fear from us.</font>

488
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.</font>

489
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to save it.</font>

490
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now come on.
We'll talk more over brown bread and stew.</font>

491
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you can go on your way.</font>

492
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing, fat boy.</font>

493
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:39,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm done talking,
that arrow's falling down on your fat head.</font>

494
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.</font>

495
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the country's starving
and look at this one.</font>

496
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:05,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.</font>

497
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lion.</font>

498
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've spoken of this.</font>

499
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot come here.</font>

500
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you said I should come
to you with any problems.</font>

501
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did anyone see you?</font>

502
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You sure?</font>

503
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father does not make idle threats.</font>

504
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.</font>

505
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to be absolutely certain.</font>

506
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. What is this problem?</font>

507
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm worried about Sansa.</font>

508
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she spoke with Lord Baelish,</font>

509
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">his friend warned me about him.</font>

510
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baelish doesn't have friends.</font>

511
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know her name.</font>

512
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Ros? The redhead?</font>

513
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know her?</font>

514
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to know as many people as I can.</font>

515
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know which one you'll need.</font>

516
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a whore.</font>

517
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, we shouldn't
be judgmental about these things.</font>

518
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucked her.</font>

519
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.</font>

520
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, yes, I fucked her once.</font>

521
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice.</font>

522
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">But since I met you,
my lady, I've been with no one else.</font>

523
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">And was she good? Did you like her?</font>

524
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as much as I like you, obviously,</font>

525
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">or she'd be the one torturing me right now.</font>

526
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did she say about Littlefinger?</font>

527
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Sansa shouldn't trust him.</font>

528
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there
an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?</font>

529
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to protect her.</font>

530
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't.</font>

531
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:05,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that the Lannisters have discarded
her, Sansa will have many suitors.</font>

532
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great beauty with a very old name.</font>

533
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?</font>

534
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she is, objectively, very.</font>

535
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:19,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her face is quite pleasing,
to other men and to women,</font>

536
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">people in general.</font>

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not to me, of course.</font>

538
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only have eyes for you.</font>

539
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pervert. You want her?</font>

540
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">This child?</font>

541
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even want to talk about her.</font>

542
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are.</font>

543
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only because you're making me.</font>

544
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't force you to open</font>

545
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">your mouth and make words come out.</font>

546
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:44,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.</font>

547
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw! "The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me. "</font>

548
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Yes.</font>

549
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now do you think I'm cruel?</font>

550
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only if you stop.</font>

551
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you mustn't come here again.</font>

552
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

553
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:22,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've come to a dangerous place
full of dangerous people.</font>

554
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dangerous people. Mmm.</font>

555
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Tyrell, my king.</font>

556
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send her in.</font>

557
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to see me, Your Grace?</font>

558
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving on a hunting trip.</font>

559
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:04,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need before I left.</font>

560
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.</font>

561
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have everything I could want.</font>

562
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Good.</font>

563
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you finding life in the capital?</font>

564
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:15,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.</font>

565
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">A welcome one.</font>

566
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:21,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">A military encampment is no place for a lady.</font>

567
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the bedside of a traitor?</font>

568
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a place for a lady?</font>

569
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

570
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.</font>

571
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:39,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was your duty to
this traitor as you saw it?</font>

572
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:43,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">The duty of any wife
to any husband. To provide him with children.</font>

573
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You failed to do this.</font>

574
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I...</font>

575
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would not speak ill of the dead.</font>

576
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think one
ought to speak kindly of a traitor</font>

577
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause he had a sword put through his heart?</font>

578
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I do beg your pardon.</font>

579
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.</font>

580
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly...</font>

581
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:16,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe
he was interested in the company of women.</font>

582
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you say this?</font>

583
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever I wanted to
make a child with him, he...</font>

584
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.</font>

585
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never wanted to try.</font>

586
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except one evening,</font>

587
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:43,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">after he'd had far too much wine to
drink, he suggested something...</font>

588
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something that sounded very painful</font>

589
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">and couldn't possibly result in children.</font>

590
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the fault was with me.</font>

591
00:41:56,515 --> 00:42:01,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he was a known degenerate.</font>

592
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's such a relief
to hear you say so, Your Grace.</font>

593
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

594
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:10,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've considered
making his perversion punishable by death.</font>

595
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">As is your right.</font>

596
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:19,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must do whatever you need to do.</font>

597
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the king.</font>

598
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

599
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

600
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like it?</font>

601
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had it made. Probably one of</font>

602
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

603
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?</font>

604
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:55,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a new design.
Much easier to load. There's no crank.</font>

605
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:59,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You use this lever to draw the string.</font>

606
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bolt goes here.</font>

607
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:12,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you just aim...</font>

608
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

609
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you take me hunting sometime?</font>

610
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Your Grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.</font>

611
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:30,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not unheard of.</font>

612
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father would never let me before...</font>

613
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You no longer belong to him.</font>

614
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to hold it?</font>

615
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I? Please.</font>

616
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:52,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine it must
be so exciting to squeeze your finger here</font>

617
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">and watch something die over there.</font>

618
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you do it?</font>

619
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:05,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you kill something?</font>

620
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?</font>

621
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

622
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to watch me?</font>

623
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

624
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Stop!</font>

625
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us the truth.</font>

626
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">About what?</font>

627
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you want.</font>

628
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the truth.</font>

629
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:34,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">What truth?</font>

630
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you take Winterfell?</font>

631
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it to... I took it...</font>

632
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who gave the orders?
- No one.</font>

633
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I took it on my own.
- Why?</font>

634
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">To take the North while vulnerable.</font>

635
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once you took it?</font>

636
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it. Rule it.</font>

637
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. That's very good.</font>

638
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you do that? I told you.</font>

639
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you take Winterfell?</font>

640
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:03,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.</font>

641
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:16,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the Starks.</font>

642
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:21,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated them for
holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.</font>

643
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

644
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

645
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:43,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you
anything. Just take it off.</font>

646
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please, just take it off.</font>

647
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?</font>

648
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.</font>

649
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:13,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't go. Please, please.
No, please don't leave me.</font>

650
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please. Please, please don't go!</font>

651
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please. Don't leave me.</font>

652
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't go.</font>

653
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rickon, stay with us.</font>

654
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. The wolves will protect him.</font>

655
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:49,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get inside his head,
see through his eyes.</font>

656
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:50,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only when I'm asleep.</font>

657
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how it begins
until you learn to control it.</font>

658
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a warg.</font>

659
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...</font>

660
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">A three-eyed raven?</font>

661
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen it?</font>

662
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?</font>

663
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it have anything to do with warging?</font>

664
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the raven is
something different, something deeper.</font>

665
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">The raven brings the sight.</font>

666
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing things that haven't happened yet?</font>

667
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or things that happened
long before you were born</font>

668
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.</font>

669
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he telling him?</font>

670
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you ask?</font>

671
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't he ashamed,
your brother, needing you to protect him?</font>

672
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the shame in that?</font>

673
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him</font>

674
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:42,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.</font>

675
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people will always need help.</font>

676
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.</font>

677
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:56,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my father died, I dreamt it.</font>

678
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:02,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.</font>

679
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the sight, too?</font>

680
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I told my father about your father,</font>

681
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.</font>

682
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father is Howland Reed?</font>

683
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

684
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saved my father's life during the rebellion.</font>

685
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father told you about the rebellion?</font>

686
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine never did. But I saw that, too.</font>

687
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else have you seen?</font>

688
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one thing that matters,</font>

689
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">you.</font>

690
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.</font>

691
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I'm averse to
drinking from a puddle every now and again.</font>

692
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't drink ale.</font>

693
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.</font>

694
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- You see?</font>

695
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've suffered through my bouts of</font>

696
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned.</font>

697
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how did three children...</font>

698
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not children.</font>

699
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did three young persons
such as yourselves,</font>

700
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:15,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">untrained in the art of war,
escape from Harrenhal?</font>

701
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:21,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armory.</font>

702
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">A smith, eh? Where'd you train?</font>

703
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.</font>

704
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">That criminal. He charges twice as much</font>

705
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">as every other armorer in the city.</font>

706
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's because he's twice as good.
- Ah-ha!</font>

707
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">A smith and a salesman.</font>

708
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gendry stole us weapons.
- Ah!</font>

709
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:44,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.</font>

710
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows how to use a sword and so do I.</font>

711
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:51,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brothers taught me.</font>

712
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

713
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">To your brothers!</font>

714
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can finish your meals before you go.</font>

715
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may be awhile before you see another.</font>

716
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll free us?</font>

717
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:30,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you my word.</font>

718
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">But before you go,</font>

719
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">allow me to raise a cup to your...</font>

720
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey.</font>

721
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that is an uncommonly large person.</font>

722
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?</font>

723
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:50,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">One waits for him to drink until he passes out.</font>

724
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor man. You have my sympathy.</font>

725
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha!</font>

726
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a man at all.</font>

727
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Hound!</font>

728
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">So good to see you again, Clegane.</font>

729
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thoros?</font>

730
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuck you doing here?</font>

731
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.</font>

732
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pretty prize, lads.</font>

733
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

734
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl.</font>

735
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in seven hells
are you doing with the Stark bitch?</font>

736
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a tough decision.</font>

737
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the bridge
and risk being seen or cross the great water.</font>

738
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence.</font>

739
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can see us on the bridge,</font>

740
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">but cross by water
and the current could take us.</font>

741
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I could escape down the river.</font>

742
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

743
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.</font>

744
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which will she choose?</font>

745
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.</font>

746
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:12,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be quick about it.</font>

747
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I need to rest.
- Get up.</font>

748
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have these,
on your feet when you walk too far.</font>

749
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you call them?
- Get up now.</font>

750
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corns. I never used to get corns.</font>

751
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:31,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier</font>

752
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">wearing the same shit boots for over a year.</font>

00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">This heel is ruined. There's no way...</font>

754
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never understood why some knights</font>

755
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">felt the need to carry two swords.</font>

756
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

757
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You move well</font>

758
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a great beast of a woman.</font>

759
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:24,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.</font>

760
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:42,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.</font>

761
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you don't kill me,</font>

762
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill you.</font>

763
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:58,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're good. Graceless, but good.</font>

764
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:11,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? If you were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.</font>

765
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,</font>

766
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can call that a woman.</font>

767
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:04,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We enjoy a good fight.
Gets ourjuices flowing.</font>

768
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:09,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Flayed Man
of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.</font>

769
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure he's the one?</font>

770
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him, all right.</font>

771
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:16,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him fight at
the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.</font>

772
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give the man his silver.</font>

773
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.</font>

774
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to buy me a new head?</font>

775
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the King in the North
hears I let the Kingslayer go,</font>

776
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:33,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll be taking it right off.</font>

777
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:35,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather he takes yours.</font>
