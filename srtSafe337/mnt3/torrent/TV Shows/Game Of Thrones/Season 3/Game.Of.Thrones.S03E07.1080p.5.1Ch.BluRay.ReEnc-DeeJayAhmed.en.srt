1
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far are we?</font>

2
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a week, I think.</font>

3
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think?</font>

4
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?</font>

5
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we went to Castle Black, we took
the King's Road.</font>

6
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your roads.</font>

7
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you lot do your fighting?</font>

8
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?</font>

9
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of the time, yes.</font>

10
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do the men holding the banners fight?</font>

11
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't, really.</font>

12
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great honor to
carry your house sigil.</font>

13
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the drummers...
Is that a great honor, too?</font>

14
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.</font>

15
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what good are they?</font>

16
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">They help the men march.</font>

17
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

18
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's...</font>

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the rhythm.</font>

20
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,</font>

21
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">right foot, left foot, right foot?</font>

22
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you need help remembering that?</font>

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,</font>

24
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">we won't be banging
on drums to let them know we're coming.</font>

25
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire</font>

27
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.</font>

28
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know nothing, Jon Snow.</font>

29
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right, you don't.</font>

30
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you cut me loose on the Wall.</font>

31
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?</font>

32
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because
she understands the way things are.</font>

33
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are you gonna share it with me,</font>

34
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">the deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?</font>

35
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">People work together when it suits them.</font>

36
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're loyal when it suits them.</font>

37
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">They love each other when it suits them.</font>

38
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they kill each other
when it suits them.</font>

39
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows that, you don't.</font>

40
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why you'll never hold on to her.</font>

41
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">That rain will cost us another day.</font>

42
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.</font>

43
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Walder is prickly by nature. If...</font>

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Prickly"? That what you call it?</font>

45
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be the least pleasant
man I've ever met.</font>

46
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and that is why...</font>

47
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen wet shits
I liked better than Walder Frey.</font>

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies, Your Grace.</font>

49
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.</font>

50
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent two years nursing wounded
men, watching them bleed and die.</font>

51
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid of wet shits.</font>

52
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.</font>

53
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can take it as he likes.</font>

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's getting the wedding he wanted.</font>

55
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's getting a wedding.</font>

56
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a king he wanted.</font>

57
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edmure is the best match a Frey has
had in the history of their house.</font>

58
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should all get some sleep.</font>

59
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't put some clothes on,</font>

60
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't promise I won't attack you again.</font>

61
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attack. Attack.</font>

62
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you writing?</font>

63
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother.</font>

64
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that Valyrian?</font>

65
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gaaa.</font>

66
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Gaaa"?</font>

67
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say hello for me.</font>

68
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rytsas.</font>

69
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ritsas."</font>

70
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was close enough.</font>

71
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know her daughter's a queen?</font>

72
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

73
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will be a surprise, I expect.</font>

74
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many surprises for her.</font>

75
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed to sit
here planning a war</font>

76
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're over there, looking like that?</font>

77
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you come with me one day to Volantis?</font>

78
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">When all this is over?</font>

79
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

80
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

81
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know she'd love to meet you.</font>

82
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And her grandchild.</font>

83
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, now?</font>

84
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you certain?</font>

85
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you angry with me?</font>

86
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angry?</font>

87
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my queen.</font>

88
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have your
little prince or princess inside me.</font>

89
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one of each.</font>

90
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't get greedy.</font>

91
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you leave the war for one night?</font>

92
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

93
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

94
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

95
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most men fuck like dogs.</font>

96
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No grace, no skill.
A few dozen thrusts, and done.</font>

97
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to be patient. Give her time.</font>

98
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your cock shouldn't go near her</font>

99
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">till she's slick as a baby seal.</font>

100
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you go inside, but slowly.</font>

101
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.</font>

102
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

103
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come on.</font>

104
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think he loves you, is that it?</font>

105
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady</font>

106
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">and live with you in some castle?</font>

107
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he didn't tell me anything.
He barely talks.</font>

108
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you two whispering in the
night, giggling like a pair of girls.</font>

109
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you're jealous?</font>

110
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I'm jealous.
You should be with one of your own.</font>

111
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're one of my own? I've never
heard a kind word from your mouth.</font>

112
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would if you were mine.</font>

113
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd tell you that
you're beautiful and fierce and wild.</font>

114
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be good to you.</font>

115
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love him?</font>

116
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?</font>

117
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?</font>

118
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think pretty is gonna make you happy?</font>

119
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.</font>

120
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't love him so much
when you find out what he really is.</font>

121
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Growing up at Winterfell,</font>

122
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">all I ever wanted was to escape,</font>

123
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">to come here to the capital.</font>

124
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">See the southern knights
and their painted armor</font>

125
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">and King's Landing after dark.</font>

126
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the candles burning
in all those windows.</font>

127
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm stupid.</font>

128
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stupid little girl
with stupid dreams who never learns.</font>

129
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

130
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come walk with me.</font>

131
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.</font>

132
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.</font>

133
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want very much for you to be happy,
Sansa, and so does my grandmother.</font>

134
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have been happy at Highgarden,</font>

135
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">but women in our position
must make the best of our circumstances.</font>

136
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I make the best
of my circumstances? I have to marry him.</font>

137
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?</font>

138
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

139
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he been kind to you?</font>

140
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's tried.</font>

141
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want him, though.</font>

142
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Lannister.</font>

143
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?</font>

144
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you...</font>

145
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son will be king.</font>

146
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sons learn from their
mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal.</font>

147
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your son, if I'm not mistaken,</font>

148
00:12:55,191 --> 00:13:00,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">your son might be the Lord of Casterly
Rock and the North someday.</font>

149
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

150
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son...</font>

151
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">With him.</font>

152
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to...</font>

153
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to...</font>

154
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it's the pain you're worried about...</font>

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid of the
pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.</font>

156
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, then?</font>

157
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's rather good-looking, even with the scar.
Especially with the scar.</font>

158
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a dwarf.</font>

159
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Loras...</font>

160
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras.</font>

161
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.</font>

162
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.</font>

163
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.</font>

164
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.</font>

165
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, sadly, so many of us get to try
so little before we're old and gray.</font>

166
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion may surprise you. From what
I've heard, he's quite experienced.</font>

167
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's a good thing?</font>

168
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can be.</font>

169
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're very complicated,
you know. Pleasing us takes practice.</font>

170
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know all this?</font>

171
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your mother teach you?</font>

172
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.</font>

173
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a child.</font>

174
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a foot taller than you.</font>

175
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tall child.</font>

176
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the youngest you've ever had?</font>

177
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that young.</font>

178
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much older?</font>

179
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Older.</font>

180
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a lord, she's a lady.</font>

181
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a beauty, at that. I
don't see the problem.</font>

182
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae isn't going to like it.</font>

183
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae is a whore.</font>

184
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna marry her, eh?</font>

185
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did marrying
a whore work out for you the first time?</font>

186
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should never have told you about that.</font>

187
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.</font>

188
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do
is get a son in the Stark girl.</font>

189
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.</font>

190
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can rule the North in his name.</font>

191
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.</font>

192
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.</font>

193
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You waste time trying
to get people to love you,</font>

194
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll end up
the most popular dead man in town.</font>

195
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to fuck that Stark girl.</font>

196
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just don't want to admit it.</font>

197
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.</font>

198
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones already there don't need company.</font>

199
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pay me to kill people who bother you.</font>

200
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evil notions come free.</font>

201
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

202
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandfather.</font>

203
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to speak to me?</font>

204
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

205
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like a report on the
meetings of my Small Council.</font>

206
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome to attend the meetings</font>

207
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your Small Council, Your Grace.</font>

208
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any or all of them.</font>

209
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been very busy.</font>

210
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many important matters
require a king's attention.</font>

211
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

212
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been holding the council meetings</font>

213
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the Tower of the Hand
instead of the Small Council chamber.</font>

214
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have, yes.</font>

215
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask why?</font>

216
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the Tower of the
Hand is where I work.</font>

217
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">To walk from there to here would take time,</font>

218
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">time I could otherwise spend productively.</font>

219
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,</font>

220
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?</font>

221
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could arrange to have you carried.</font>

222
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.</font>

223
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you hear about this?</font>

224
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true?</font>

225
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently so.</font>

226
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?</font>

227
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was Hand of
the King under your father's predecessor,</font>

228
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">the skulls of all the Targaryen
dragons were kept in this room.</font>

229
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">The skull of the last
of them was right here.</font>

230
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the size of an apple.</font>

231
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the biggest was the size of a carriage.</font>

232
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.</font>

233
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosities on the far side of
the world are no threat to us.</font>

234
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities</font>

235
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?</font>

236
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we have been told
as much by the many experts</font>

237
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">who serve the realm by counseling the King</font>

238
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">on matters about which he knows nothing.</font>

239
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I haven't been counseled.</font>

240
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are being counseled
at this very moment.</font>

241
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be consulted about such things.</font>

242
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on, I will see to it that you are</font>

243
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">appropriately consulted
on important matters</font>

244
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">whenever necessary.</font>

245
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

246
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yunkai. The Yellow City.</font>

247
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Yunkish train bed slaves,
not soldiers. We can defeat them.</font>

248
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.</font>

249
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.</font>

250
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls</font>

251
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">and chip away at us, man by man.</font>

252
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want half my army killed</font>

253
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.</font>

254
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi.</font>

255
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking this city will not bring you</font>

256
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.</font>

257
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many slaves are there in Yunkai?</font>

258
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">200,000, if not more.</font>

259
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.</font>

260
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send a man to the city gates.</font>

261
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the slavers I will receive them here,
and accept their surrender.</font>

262
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer
the same fate as Astapor.</font>

263
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz</font>

264
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">of that ancient and honorable house,</font>

265
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master of Men and Speaker to
Savages, to offer terms of peace.</font>

266
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noble lord, you are in the presence</font>

267
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,</font>

268
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Queen of the Andals and the First Men,</font>

269
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,</font>

270
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.</font>

271
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may approach. Sit.</font>

272
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will
the noble lord take refreshment?</font>

273
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.</font>

274
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our empire was old
before dragons stirred in old Valyria.</font>

275
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many an army has broken against our walls.</font>

276
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shall find
no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.</font>

277
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

278
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Unsullied need
practice. I was told to blood them early.</font>

279
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.</font>

280
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?</font>

281
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis true you have
committed savageries in Astapor,</font>

282
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the Yunkai
are a forgiving and generous people.</font>

283
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wise masters of Yunkai have
sent a gift for the Silver Queen.</font>

284
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is far more than
this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.</font>

285
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My ship?
- Yes, Khaleesi.</font>

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I said, we are a generous people.</font>

287
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shall have as many
ships as you require.</font>

288
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do you ask in return?</font>

289
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we ask
is that you make use of these ships.</font>

290
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong,</font>

291
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.</font>

292
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a gift for you as well.</font>

293
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your life.</font>

294
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life?</font>

295
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the lives of your wise masters.</font>

296
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I also want something in return.</font>

297
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will release every slave in Yunkai.</font>

298
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man, woman, and child</font>

299
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">shall be given as much food, clothing,
and property as they can carry</font>

300

and I shall show you no mercy.</font>

302
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are mad.</font>

303
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are
Yunkai, and we have powerful friends.</font>

304
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends who would
take great pleasure in destroying you.</font>

305
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.</font>

306
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.</font>

307
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You swore me safe conduct.
- I did,</font>

308
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my dragons made no promises.</font>

309
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you threatened their mother.</font>

310
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the gold.</font>

311
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gold. You gave it to me, remember?</font>

312
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I shall put it to good use.</font>

313
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.</font>

314
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now get out.</font>

315
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,241

<font color="#FFFFFF">Chains?</font>

321
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.</font>

322
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smithed in Casterly Rock.</font>

323

<font color="#FFFFFF">Golden chains.</font>

324
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could buy a ship with these.</font>

325
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I need a ship?
- What?</font>

326
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I going somewhere?</font>

327
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you're not going anywhere.</font>

328
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, am I invited to your wedding?</font>

329
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask for this marriage.
I didn't want it.</font>

330
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.</font>

331
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean that...</font>

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is duty, not desire.</font>

333
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you
will tell yourself when you fuck her?</font>

334
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a choice. My father...</font>

335

<font color="#FFFFFF">Does not rule the world.</font>

336
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can still go across the Narrow Sea.</font>

337

341
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">My feelings for you have not changed.</font>

342
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.</font>

343

<font color="#FFFFFF">While I empty her chamber
pot and lick your cock when you're bored?</font>

344

<font color="#FFFFFF">No? What will it be like?</font>

346
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,223

clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.</font>

will be well provided for.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. Listen to me, my lady.</font>

354
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,002

00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one here but
you, me, and Violet.</font>

451
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

452
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want us to see it?</font>

453
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on. Let us see it.</font>

454
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody talks about it.</font>

455
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who sent you?</font>

456
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who sent us?</font>

457
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy. We heard so much about it.</font>

458
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

459
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

460
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is.</font>

461
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

462
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think we're ugly?</font>

463
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks we're ugly.</font>

464
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's been through so much.</font>

465
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at his poor face.</font>

466
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me.</font>

467
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he comes back...</font>

468
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to make him feel better.</font>

469
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how can we make him feel better?</font>

470
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea.</font>

471
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

472
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:43,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's shy. You know how they
are, these religious girls.</font>

473
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he doesn't know how we are.</font>

474
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt something.</font>

475
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lord Greyjoy.</font>

476
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">As good as they say?</font>

477
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

478
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why should you get all the fun?</font>

479
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You like her better?</font>

480
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plenty there for both of us.</font>

481
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was here first.</font>

482
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

483
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible timing.</font>

484
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was getting jealous.</font>

485
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

486
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?</font>

487
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows you love girls.</font>

488
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you always thought
they loved you back.</font>

489
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.</font>

490
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you say it's your most precious part?</font>

491
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

492
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:06,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy!
Mercy!</font>

493
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mercy.</font>

494
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not killing you.</font>

495
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just making a few alterations.</font>

496
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No! Please, no! No!</font>

497
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, please! Please!</font>

498
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna scare it off.</font>

499
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm
not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.</font>

500
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too far away.</font>

501
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a palace?</font>

502
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a windmill.</font>

503
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Windmill.</font>

504
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who built it? Some king?</font>

505
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the men who used to live here.</font>

506
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">They must have been great
builders, stacking stones so high.</font>

507
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winterfell has towers
three times that size.</font>

508
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell.</font>

509
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My daddy was a fancy lord</font>

510
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."</font>

511
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're impressed
by a windmill, you'd be swooning</font>

512
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.</font>

513
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's swooning?</font>

514
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fainting.</font>

515
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's fainting?</font>

516
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a girl sees blood and collapses.</font>

517
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would a girl see blood and collapse?</font>

518
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

519
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all girls are like you.</font>

520
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, girls see more blood than boys.</font>

521
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?</font>

522
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.</font>

523
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dress is made
of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.</font>

524
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to see you in a silk dress.</font>

525
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you?</font>

526
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I could tear it off you.</font>

527
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you rip my pretty silk
dress, I'll blacken your eye.</font>

528
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.</font>

529
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe one day I'll take you there.</font>

530
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we've taken our land back.</font>

531
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ygritte.</font>

532
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't win.</font>

533
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.</font>

534
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know nothing...</font>

535
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six times in the last thousand years,</font>

536
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.</font>

537
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six times they failed.</font>

538
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do you know that?</font>

539
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every boy in
the North knows it. We grow up learning it.</font>

540
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the battles
were fought, the heroes, who died where.</font>

541
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:16,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six times you've invaded
and six times you've failed.</font>

542
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">The seventh will be the same.</font>

543
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance is different.</font>

544
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have the discipline.</font>

545
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.</font>

546
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know how to fight together.</font>

547
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know that.</font>

548
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

549
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it.</font>

550
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you attack the Wall, you'll die.
All of you.</font>

551
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of us.</font>

552
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mine as I'm yours.</font>

553
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we die, we die.</font>

554
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first we'll live.</font>

555
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, first we'll live.</font>

556
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he going on about?</font>

557
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how come he always gets to sit and
chat while we do all the work?</font>

558
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

559
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?</font>

560
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.</font>

561
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I can't hear you every day?</font>

562
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filling his head with black magic.</font>

563
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and worse.</font>

564
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him alone.</font>

565
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can speak for himself.</font>

566
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't fill his head with anything.</font>

567
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you talk about?</font>

568
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening to him
and what that means.</font>

569
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, then. Tell us what it means.</font>

570
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like that.</font>

571
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could tell him all the answers.
It would be much easier.</font>

572
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you talking to him anymore.</font>

573
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until we get to your
brother at Castle Black.</font>

574
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going to Castle Black.</font>

575
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

576
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.</font>

577
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bran needs to find the
raven beyond the Wall.</font>

578
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. I'm not going back there.</font>

579
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother is
at Castle Black. That's where we're going.</font>

580
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

581
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:43,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">The raven's been coming
to me ever since I fell from that tower.</font>

582
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants me to find him.</font>

583
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have my legs anymore.</font>

584
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I have now.</font>

585
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black</font>

586
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can get back to
them, where you belong.</font>

587
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I belong in the North?</font>

588
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I fell from that
tower for a reason?</font>

589
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what he's
telling you? That it's all for a reason?</font>

590
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these bad things happened because the
Gods got big plans for you?</font>

591
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish it were true, little lord.</font>

592
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.</font>

593
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand. You don't know.</font>

594
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know. None of you know.</font>

595
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of you have been up there.</font>

596
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a man once. A good man.</font>

597
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:38,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.</font>

598
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">But one night Bruni disappears.</font>

599
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">People said he left me, but I knew him.</font>

600
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd never leave me. Not for long.</font>

601
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew he'd come back.</font>

602
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he did.</font>

603
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came in through the back of the hut.</font>

604
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.</font>

605
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:12,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">His skin was pale like a dead man's.</font>

606
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">His eyes bluer than clear sky.</font>

607
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:26,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard</font>

608
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could feel the life slipping out of me.</font>

609
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how I got the knife.</font>

610
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:39,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.</font>

611
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he hardly seemed to notice.</font>

612
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to burn our hut down with him inside.</font>

613
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.</font>

614
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't need to. I already knew.</font>

615
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">It meant the North was
no place for men to be. Not anymore.</font>

616
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.</font>

617
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is the pain, my lord?</font>

618
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?</font>

619
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've stymied the corruption.</font>

620
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we've stymied the corruption.</font>

621
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a learned man.</font>

622
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the good it's done me.</font>

623
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did well sewing up this mess.</font>

624
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're far better at this sort of
work than Grand Maester Pycelle.</font>

625
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faint praise, my lord.</font>

626
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, why did the Citadel take your chain?</font>

627
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you fondle one boy too many?</font>

628
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord. That's not my weakness.</font>

629
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

630
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosity.</font>

631
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:13,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,</font>

632
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.</font>

633
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">You performed experiments on living men.</font>

634
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On dying men.
- With their permission?</font>

635
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.</font>

636
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.</font>

637
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You found them moaning in the poorhouse</font>

638
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">and had them carted back to your garret</font>

639
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.</font>

640
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men have you killed, my lord?</font>

641
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- 50?</font>

642
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">100?</font>

643
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Countless.</font>

644
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Countless" has a nice ring to it.</font>

645
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how many lives have you saved?</font>

646
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half a million.</font>

647
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">The population of King's Landing.</font>

648
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were in charge of the
ravens at Harrenhal.</font>

649
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you... Did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?</font>

650
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bird flew off and a bird flew back.</font>

651
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Selwyn Tarth</font>

652
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.</font>

653
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fair offer.</font>

654
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fair offer. Locke won't take it.</font>

655
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:32,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

656
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's convinced Lord Tarth
owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.</font>

657
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">He feels he's being cheated.</font>

658
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd be fools to kill her.</font>

659
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men have been at war a long time.</font>

660
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of them will be dead by winter.</font>

661
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be their entertainment tonight.</font>

662
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beyond tonight,
I don't think they care very much.</font>

663
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to return to Harrenhal.</font>

664
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I've left something behind.</font>

665
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely not.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.</font>

666
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what are those orders?</font>

667
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">To deliver you
to your father at King's Landing.</font>

668
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you'll get a reward.</font>

669
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve Lord Bolton.</font>

670
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any appreciation your father...</font>

671
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're getting a reward.</font>

672
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me explain
something to you. When my father sees me,</font>

673
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first thing he's going to
ask is what happened to my hand,</font>

674
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.</font>

675
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had nothing...</font>

676
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I could tell him this man saved my life.</font>

677
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">We return to Harrenhal. Now.</font>

678
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.</font>

679
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair</font>

680
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">From there to here, from here to there</font>

681
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">All black and brown and covered in hair</font>

682
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">He smelled that girl in the summer air</font>

683
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair</font>

684
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't spare her.</font>

685
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't spare her!</font>

686
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.</font>

687
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop running and fight.</font>

688
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wooden sword?</font>

689
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd gone.</font>

690
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave her a wooden sword!</font>

691
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've only got one bear.</font>

692
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pay her bloody ransom.</font>

693
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
Just get her out of there.</font>

694
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you lords and ladies still think that</font>

695
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only thing that matters is gold.</font>

696
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.</font>

697
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.</font>

698
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">So go buy yourself a golden
hand and fuck yourself with it!</font>

699
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get behind me.
- I will not.</font>

700
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are you doing to my bear?</font>

701
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him
back to King's Landing alive,</font>

702
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's what I aim to do.</font>

703
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull her up!</font>

704
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold my legs.</font>

705
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull him up!</font>

706
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bitch stays.</font>

707
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're taking her
to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.</font>

708
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">She belongs to me.</font>

709
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Bolton's orders.</font>

710
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you
think is more important to Lord Bolton?</font>

711
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting his pet rat a reward</font>

712
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?</font>

713
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we must be on our way.</font>

714
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about the sapphires.</font>
