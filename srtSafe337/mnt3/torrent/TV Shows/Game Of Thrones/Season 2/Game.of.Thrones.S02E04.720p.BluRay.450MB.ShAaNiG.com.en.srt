1
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.</font>

2
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.</font>

3
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.</font>

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.</font>

5
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.</font>

6
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he ever gets out.</font>

7
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras Tyrell?</font>

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.</font>

9
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of them.</font>

10
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">How good could he be?</font>

11
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,
and Renly ain't dead.</font>

12
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horses seem a little spooked to you?</font>

13
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're horses.</font>

14
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get spooked by their own shadows.</font>

15
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear that?</font>

16
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

17
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something out there.</font>

18
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

19
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're a right little prick.</font>

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see your face.</font>

21
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear you pissed yourself.</font>

22
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"</font>

23
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is something out there.</font>

24
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, don't even try me.</font>

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?</font>

26
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rennick!</font>

27
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- King in the North!
- The King in the North!</font>

28
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.</font>

29
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're dead.
Take everything they've got.</font>

30
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.</font>

31
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barely enough food to feed our own.</font>

32
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.</font>

33
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Your Grace.</font>

34
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">The officers will be useful.</font>

35
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.</font>

36
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt it.</font>

37
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll learn soon enough.</font>

38
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my family, we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.</font>

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A flayed man none."</font>

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father outlawed flaying in the North.</font>

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.</font>

42
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">The high road's very pretty,</font>

43
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.</font>

44
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.</font>

45
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.</font>

46
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't! Don't! Please!</font>

47
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rot's set in.</font>

48
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't! No, don't!</font>

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shh.
- Please, don't!</font>

50
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.</font>

51
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now...</font>

52
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't!</font>

53
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser! Please, ser.</font>

54
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she doesn't.</font>

55
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be a cripple, please.</font>

56
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely one of our men
needs your attention more than this cub.</font>

57
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your men are not my men, my lord.</font>

58
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.</font>

59
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.</font>

60
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better than biting your own tongue,
believe me.</font>

61
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Talisa.</font>

62
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your last name?</font>

63
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know what side
my family fights on?</font>

64
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.</font>

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">That boy lost his foot on your orders.</font>

66
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">They killed my father.</font>

67
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.</font>

68
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?</font>

69
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.</font>

70
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.</font>

71
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no hatred for the lad.</font>

72
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should help his foot grow back.</font>

73
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.</font>

74
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand. The country would be at peace</font>

75
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">and life would be just under
the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.</font>

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the gods give me strength.</font>

77
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And then what?
- I don't know.</font>

78
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go back to Winterfell.</font>

79
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.</font>

80
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who will?</font>

81
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

82
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fighting to overthrow a king,</font>

83
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?</font>

84
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">First we have to win the war.</font>

85
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never told me where you're from.</font>

86
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Volantis.
- Volantis? You're far from home.</font>

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy was lucky you were here.</font>

88
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was unlucky that you were.</font>

89
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.</font>

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

91
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever my traitor brother has done,
I had no part.</font>

92
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that. I beg you, please...</font>

93
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.</font>

94
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using some vile sorcery,</font>

95
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.</font>

96
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands of good men were butchered.</font>

97
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the slaughter,
the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.</font>

98
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing you
would send your brother a message.</font>

99
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my mother insists on keeping you alive.</font>

100
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand.</font>

101
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.</font>

102
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meryn.</font>

103
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave her face. I like her pretty.</font>

104
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meryn, my lady is overdressed.</font>

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unburden her.</font>

106
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder.</font>

107
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the meaning of this?</font>

108
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?</font>

109
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind who serves his king, lmp.</font>

110
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
all over your pretty white cloak.</font>

111
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone get the girl
something to cover herself with.</font>

112
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is to be your queen.</font>

113
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you no regard for her honor?</font>

114
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm punishing her.
- For what crimes?</font>

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did not fight her brother's battle,
you half-wit.</font>

116
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!</font>

117
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mad King did as he liked.</font>

118
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you
what happened to him?</font>

119
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.</font>

120
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.</font>

121
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.</font>

122
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a threat. See the difference?</font>

123
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize for my nephew's behavior.</font>

124
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?</font>

125
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.</font>

126
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.</font>

127
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little king's backed up.</font>

128
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clogged from balls to brains.</font>

129
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?</font>

130
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no cure for being a cunt.</font>

131
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the boy's at that age.</font>

132
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's got nothing to do all day
but pick wings off flies.</font>

133
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.</font>

134
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, dog?</font>

135
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:16,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your uncle left your nameday present
and asked me to see that you got it.</font>

136
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

137
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

138
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look inside, Your Grace.</font>

139
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

140
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.</font>

141
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't tell if you won't.</font>

142
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

143
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her.</font>

144
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Touch her.</font>

145
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you hit her?</font>

146
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle sent you?</font>

147
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.</font>

148
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

149
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use this.</font>

150
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harder.</font>

151
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said harder.</font>

152
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd want me to get his money's worth.</font>

153
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.</font>

154
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Your Grace.</font>

155
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...</font>

156
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I want him to find out.</font>

157
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished</font>

158
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">and show him what you've done,</font>

159
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the same thing will happen to you.</font>

160
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begin.</font>

161
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harder!</font>

162
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.</font>

163
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.</font>

164
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

165
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
is that it?</font>

166
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:18,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?</font>

167
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a practical man.</font>

168
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just not a loyal one.</font>

169
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who would you have me be loyal to?</font>

170
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother's corpse?</font>

171
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like you, Lord Baelish.</font>

172
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like your face.</font>

173
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.</font>

174
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.</font>

175
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me, why are you here?</font>

176
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.</font>

177
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,</font>

178
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">many who believe Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.</font>

179
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I understand.</font>

180
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:11,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I have the numbers.
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.</font>

181
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.</font>

182
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your head.</font>

183
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would give priority to my head.</font>

184
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,</font>

185
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not come here today
seeking your affection.</font>

186
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you march on King's Landing,</font>

187
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...</font>

188
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">open gates.</font>

189
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

190
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish.</font>

191
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of these tents look the same to me.</font>

192
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.</font>

193
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.</font>

194
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.</font>

195
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
we're on the move again.</font>

196
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Your tent"?</font>

197
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not "Our tent"?</font>

198
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?</font>

199
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pressures of command, no doubt.</font>

200
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four kings vying for the throne.</font>

201
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not tutored in warfare,</font>

202
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">but basic arithmetic
favors the side with the greater numbers.</font>

203
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.</font>

204
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent just now.</font>

205
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place of a Kingsguard
is by the king's side.</font>

206
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:53,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?</font>

207
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem quite interested in our marriage.</font>

208
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your marriage is quite interesting.</font>

209
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only to me, but to the realm.</font>

210
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:06,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest, if nothing else.</font>

211
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never married, have you?</font>

212
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.</font>

213
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is sad.</font>

214
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though perhaps it's for the best.</font>

215
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,</font>

216
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">so allow me to explain.</font>

217
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband is my king,
and my king is my husband.</font>

218
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.</font>

219
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't your horse.</font>

220
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was given to me by the Thirteen.</font>

221
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Elders of Qarth.</font>

222
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Qarth?</font>

223
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days to the east, on the sea.</font>

224
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will they let us in?</font>

225
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said they would be honored
to receive the Mother of Dragons.</font>

226
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know of this place?</font>

227
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.</font>

228
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,</font>

229
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">the garden grows.</font>

230
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go on!
- You, keep moving!</font>

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring her about!</font>

232
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of fire melts stone?</font>

233
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragon fire.</font>

234
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's dragons here?</font>

235
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, all the dragons are dead.</font>

236
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that smell?</font>

237
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead people.</font>

238
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move.</font>

239
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please, no, no!</font>

240
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

241
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

242
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was my son.</font>

243
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister was three days ago.</font>

244
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband, the day before that.</font>

245
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">They take someone every day?</font>

246
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone live?</font>

247
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey.</font>

248
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei.</font>

249
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ilyn Payne.</font>

250
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound.</font>

251
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey.</font>

252
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei.</font>

253
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ilyn Payne.</font>

254
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound.</font>

255
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey. Cersei.</font>

256
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ilyn Payne. The Hound.</font>

257
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you?</font>

258
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have heard false reports.</font>

259
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?</font>

260
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.</font>

261
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I begged him to seize the moment.</font>

262
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trusted you. My husband trusted you.</font>

263
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you repaid our faith with treachery.</font>

264
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, my lady.
- Get out!</font>

265
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cat, I've...</font>

266
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've loved you since I was a boy.</font>

267
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...</font>

268
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you lost your mind? Get out!</font>

269
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see your girls again?</font>

270
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa, more beautiful than ever?</font>

271
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Arya, just as wild as ever?</font>

272
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have Arya, too?</font>

273
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both girls are healthy and safe.</font>

274
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now.</font>

275
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.</font>

276
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.</font>

277
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

278
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters will trade your daughters
for the Kingslayer.</font>

279
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course they will.</font>

280
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime Lannister for two girls?</font>

281
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb will never agree to those terms.</font>

282
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not bringing these terms to him.</font>

283
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bringing them to you.</font>

284
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I keep secrets from my son?</font>

285
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,</font>

286
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's not a mother.</font>

287
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider it, Cat.</font>

288
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may not get another chance.</font>

289
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.</font>

290
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.</font>

291
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners</font>

292
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">is offered in good faith.</font>

293
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good faith?</font>

294
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

295
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband was an honorable man.</font>

296
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.</font>

297
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You may not believe...
- Get out.</font>

298
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, you dogs!</font>

299
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him, the one who picks.</font>

300
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,650

<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Polliver. Some food.</font>

331
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a crust of bread.</font>

332
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,264

334
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.</font>

335
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,499

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whose banner is that?
- My own.</font>

339
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.</font>

340
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is your stag on fire?</font>

341
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.</font>

342
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.</font>

343
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, brother,</font>

344
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.</font>

345
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself, Renly.</font>

346
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I'm relieved.</font>

347
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never really believed you were a fanatic.</font>

348
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,</font>

349
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not a godly man.</font>

350
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should kneel before your brother.</font>

351
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the Lord's chosen,</font>

352
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">born amidst salt and smoke.</font>

- That's twice I've warned you.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to yourselves.</font>

356
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together</font>

357
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.</font>

358
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.</font>

359
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband was a supporter of my claim.</font>

360
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.</font>

361
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.</font>

362
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">We share a common enemy.</font>

363
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Iron Throne is mine by right.</font>

364
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those that deny that are my foes.</font>

365
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.</font>

366
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old men deny it with their death rattle</font>

367
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.</font>

368
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one wants you for their king.</font>

369
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never wanted any friends, brother.</font>

370
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a man without friends
is a man without power.</font>

371
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the sake of the mother who bore us,
I will give you this one night to reconsider.</font>

372
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,</font>

373
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will grant you
your old seat in the Council.</font>

374
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll even name you my heir</font>

375
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">until a son is born to me.</font>

376
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise I shall destroy you.</font>

377
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look across those fields, brother.</font>

378
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you see all those banners?</font>

379
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?</font>

380
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

381
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.</font>

382
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shall see, Renly.</font>

383
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come the dawn, we shall see.</font>

384
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look to your sins, Lord Renly.</font>

385
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night is dark and full of terrors.</font>

386
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you believe I loved him once?</font>

387
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were welcome.</font>

388
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,</font>

389
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">you might do the same, Khaleesi.</font>

390
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horde?</font>

391
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Daenerys...</font>

392
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.</font>

393
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know me, my lord?</font>

394
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only by reputation, Khaleesi.</font>

395
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.</font>

396
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call you the Mother of Dragons.</font>

397
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what should I call you?</font>

398
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my name is quite long</font>

399
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.</font>

400
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am simply a trader of spices.</font>

401

and protection of Qarth,</font>

403

- Qarth.</font>

406
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,422

00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend,</font>

408
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,600

I would be honored...</font>

411
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,</font>

412
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">but no man alive has seen a living dragon.</font>

413

<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of my more skeptical friends</font>

414

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't think you are.</font>

419
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as I've never met you before,</font>

return to where you come from.</font>

426
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised to receive me.</font>

427
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have received you.</font>

428
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,326

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen!</font>

435
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:13,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me</font>

436
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">and destroy those who have wronged me.</font>

437
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,493

448
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am one of the Thirteen,</font>

00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?</font>

452
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is the Mother of Dragons.</font>

453
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?</font>

454
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we can allow a few Dothraki</font>

455
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">through our gates without dooming our city.</font>

456
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, here I am,</font>

457
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">a savage from the Summer lsles,
and Qarth still stands.</font>

458
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our decision is final.</font>

459
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

460
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invoke soumai.</font>

461
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:39,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.</font>

462
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be it on your head.</font>

463
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Qarth, my lady.</font>

464
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

465
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there gold or silver
in the village?</font>

466
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?</font>

467
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that is.</font>

468
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two.
Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.</font>

469
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

470
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.</font>

471
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evidently not.</font>

472
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are these prisoners not in their cells?</font>

473
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cells are overflowing, my lord.</font>

474
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.</font>

475
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...</font>

476
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard</font>

477
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">able young bodies and skilled laborers?</font>

478
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, do you have a trade?</font>

479
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smith, my lord.</font>

480
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at? Kneel!</font>

481
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.</font>

482
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll do no such thing.</font>

483
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's a girl, you idiot,</font>

484
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">dressed as a boy.</font>

485
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.</font>

486
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart.</font>

487
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than I can say for this lot.</font>

488
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get these prisoners to work.</font>

489
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the girl.</font>

490
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a new cupbearer.</font>

491
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

492
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your visits are too few, cousin.</font>

493
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her Grace, the Queen Regent,</font>

494
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.</font>

495
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.</font>

496
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you take a cup with me?</font>

497
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.</font>

498
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, lmp.</font>

499
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,</font>

500
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have thought she'd come herself.</font>

501
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?</font>

502
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what you make of it,</font>

503
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.</font>

504
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?</font>

505
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I said several times.</font>

506
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?</font>

507
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.</font>

508
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei must have great trust in you,</font>

509
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.</font>

510
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.</font>

511
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">She often works from dusk till dawn.</font>

512
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusk till dawn.</font>

513
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

514
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lavender oil.</font>

515
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.</font>

516
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a knight!</font>

517
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">An anointed knight, yes.</font>

518
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?</font>

519
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Nothing to say?</font>

520
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more warnings for me, ser?</font>

521
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will withdraw these filthy accusations.</font>

522
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say</font>

523
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?</font>

524
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my fault!</font>

525
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she take you against your will?</font>

526
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you not defend yourself, knight?</font>

527
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,</font>

528
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">he told me to obey her in everything.</font>

529
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he tell you to fuck her, too?</font>

530
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only meant I did as I was bid.</font>

531
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hated every moment of it,</font>

532
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that what you'll have me believe?</font>

533
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">A high place in court, a knighthood,</font>

534
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.</font>

535
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.</font>

536
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.</font>

537
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.</font>

538
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the Queen.</font>

539
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll leave the city at once, I swear.</font>

540
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I think not.
- My lord?</font>

541
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard me.</font>

542
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.</font>

543
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.</font>

544
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleasure her whenever she requires.</font>

545
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.</font>

546
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know what Cersei is doing,</font>

547
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:47,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.</font>

548
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will tell me.</font>

549
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord, I will.</font>

550
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it, as you command.</font>

551
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, rise, rise.</font>

552
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us drink to our understanding.</font>

553
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.</font>

554
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:11,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good of the realm.</font>

555
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,</font>

556
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I want no more conflict between us</font>

557
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.</font>

558
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">But her demands?</font>

559
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.</font>

560
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.</font>

561
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.</font>

562
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,</font>

563
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.</font>

564
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay within one table length.</font>

565
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

566
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do your knucklebones bring you luck?</font>

567
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.</font>

568
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's four less fingernails to clean.</font>

569
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fewer.
- Pardon?</font>

570
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four fewer fingernails to clean.</font>

571
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never understood why you had to wear them.</font>

572
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.</font>

573
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It reminds me of yourjustice.</font>

574
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.</font>

575
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a hero and a smuggler.</font>

576
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.</font>

577
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lesson I've tried to teach my son.</font>

578
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does he listen?
- To me?</font>

579
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, no.</font>

580
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...</font>

581
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has a name.</font>

582
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.</font>

583
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lived within the law for 17...</font>

584
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to be a smuggler this time.</font>

585
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any shore, any night.</font>

586
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I bringing ashore?</font>

587
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">The red woman.</font>

588
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.</font>

589
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am true to Your Grace and always will be,</font>

590
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.</font>

591
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cleaner ways don't win wars.</font>

592
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you afraid, Onion Knight?</font>

593
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.</font>

594
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.</font>

595
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?</font>

596
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.</font>

597
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.</font>

598
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man is good or he is evil.</font>

599
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And which are you?
- Oh, good.</font>

600
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.</font>

601
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that must be very nice for you.</font>

602
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you love your wife?
- I do.</font>

603
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet you have known other women.</font>

604
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk about my wife.</font>

605
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not. I'm talking about other women.</font>

606
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like me, Ser Davos.</font>

607
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me.</font>

608
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to see what's beneath this robe.</font>

609
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will.</font>

610
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.</font>

611
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.</font>

612
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are servants of light, the children of fire.</font>

613
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.</font>

614
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.</font>

615
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't bar our passage.</font>

616
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods protect us.</font>

617
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one god, Ser Davos,</font>

618
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he only protects those who serve him.</font>
