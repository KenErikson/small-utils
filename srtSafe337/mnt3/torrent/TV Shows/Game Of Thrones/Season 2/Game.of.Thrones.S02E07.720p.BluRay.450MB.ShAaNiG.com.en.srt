1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cripple?</font>

2
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let a cripple escape?</font>

3
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?</font>

4
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">The giant must have took him.</font>

5
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">The giant?</font>

6
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor?</font>

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's all right, then.</font>

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.</font>

9
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Rickon, too? The little one?</font>

10
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gone, along with the wildling woman.</font>

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one you were fucking.</font>

12
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

13
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the horses and the hounds.</font>

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, find the scent.</font>

15
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they going?</font>

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt!</font>

17
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoying your first hunt?</font>

18
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.</font>

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">With hunting, there's blood at the end.</font>

20
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're little boys.</font>

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.</font>

22
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I kept my word. I never ran away.</font>

23
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.</font>

24
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.</font>

25
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.</font>

26
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have no value to me missing.</font>

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.</font>

28
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.</font>

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll get here long before they do.</font>

30
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Ned Stark always said
500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000.</font>

31
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a scent!</font>

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hounds have the scent.</font>

33
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Maester, don't look so grim.</font>

34
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all just a game.</font>

35
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have took more food.</font>

36
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.</font>

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people all love you. They would have
given you whatever you needed.</font>

38
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.</font>

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.</font>

40
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been walking since before sunrise.</font>

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.</font>

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.</font>

43
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I know that farm.</font>

44
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.</font>

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jack and Billy.</font>

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.</font>

47
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them
until he finds out where we are.</font>

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.</font>

49
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.</font>

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be after us with hounds.</font>

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.</font>

52
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you pull a knife on me in the night?</font>

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter?</font>

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't be the first time you pressed your bone
against a woman's arse.</font>

55
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move.</font>

56
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the first time.</font>

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old are you, boy?</font>

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a man of the Night's Watch.</font>

59
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a boy who's never been with a girl.</font>

60
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:43,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets...</font>

61
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call them that.</font>

62
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, stones?</font>

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or bone?</font>

64
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither.</font>

65
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both.</font>

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

67
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard they get all swollen and bruised
if you don't use them.</font>

68
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:13,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say
when they want me feeling sorry for them.</font>

69
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if I'd feel sorry for them.</font>

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are there no girl crows?</font>

71
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.</font>

72
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the lads just do it with each other?</font>

73
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

74
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never?
- Never.</font>

75
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">We swore an oath.</font>

76
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have sheep at the Wall?</font>

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">With your hands, then?</font>

78
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder you're all so miserable.</font>

79
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Would you please shut up?
- Would you please shut up?</font>

80
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're better than me, crow.</font>

81
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm a free woman.
- You're a free woman?</font>

82
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.</font>

83
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're my prisoner, you're not
a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.</font>

84
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think you're free?</font>

85
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.</font>

86
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my choice to say the words.</font>

87
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.</font>

88
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you chose never to touch them.</font>

89
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the price you pay
if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.</font>

90
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">So instead of getting naked with a girl,
you'd prefer to invade our lands...</font>

91
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">invade your lands?</font>

92
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildlings raid our lands all the time.</font>

93
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of them tried to kill my little brother,
a crippled boy!</font>

94
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not your lands!</font>

95
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been here the whole time.</font>

96
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lot came along and just put up a big wall
and said it was yours.</font>

97
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was Ned Stark.</font>

98
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the blood of the First Men.</font>

99
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">My ancestors lived here, same as yours.</font>

100
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why are you fighting us?</font>

101
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

102
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I want you to tell me
what happened.</font>

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, this way.</font>

104
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, speak up. Speak up.</font>

105
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wolfsbane.</font>

106
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rare substance.</font>

107
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no common assassin.</font>

108
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hanged 20 men last night.</font>

109
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if you hanged 100.</font>

110
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.</font>

111
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think it was an infiltrator from
the Brotherhood Without Banners.</font>

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.</font>

113
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.</font>

114
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That's how kings fall.</font>

115
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want them dead, every one.</font>

116
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing them isn't the problem.</font>

117
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's finding them.</font>

118
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you gone soft, Clegane?</font>

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always thought you had a talent for violence.</font>

120
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn the villages, burn the farms.</font>

121
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.</font>

122
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

123
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that mutton?</font>

124
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

125
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't like mutton.</font>

126
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll bring something else.
- Leave it.</font>

127
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you hungry?
- No.</font>

128
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are.</font>

129
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat.</font>

130
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll eat in the kitchen later.</font>

131
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.</font>

132
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

133
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat.</font>

134
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're small for your age.</font>

135
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.</font>

136
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I eat a lot.</font>

137
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't grow.</font>

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will be my last war.</font>

140
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Win or lose.</font>

141
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever lost before?</font>

142
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?</font>

143
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is the one I'll be remembered for.</font>

144
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.</font>

145
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.</font>

146
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what legacy means?</font>

147
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.</font>

148
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what remains of you when you're gone.</font>

149
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harren the Black thought
this castle would be his legacy.</font>

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">The greatest fortress ever built.</font>

151
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tallest towers, the strongest walls.</font>

152
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Great Hall had 35 hearths.</font>

153
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty-five. Can you imagine?</font>

154
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at it now.</font>

155
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blasted ruin.</font>

156
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what happened?</font>

157
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragons?</font>

158
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

159
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragons happened.</font>

160
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.</font>

161
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">A million men could have
marched on these walls,</font>

162
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a million men would have been repelled.</font>

163
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">But an attack from the air with dragon fire...
Mmm-mmm.</font>

164
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.</font>

165
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.</font>

166
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why every child alive
still knows his name</font>

167
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">300 years after his death.</font>

168
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aegon and his sisters.</font>

169
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm?</font>

170
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.</font>

171
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.</font>

172
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.</font>

173
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">A student of history, are you?</font>

174
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhaenys rode Meraxes.</font>

175
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Visenya rode Vhagar.</font>

176
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.</font>

177
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.</font>

178
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.</font>

179
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

180
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a heroine of yours, I take it?</font>

181
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?</font>

182
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?</font>

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most girls are idiots.</font>

184
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me of my daughter.</font>

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?</font>

186
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">From my father.</font>

187
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a well-read stonemason.</font>

188
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.</font>

189
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?</font>

190
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful now, girl.</font>

191
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I enjoy you, but be careful.</font>

192
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that back to the kitchen.</font>

193
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat what you want.</font>

194
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, girl.</font>

195
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">"M'lord."</font>

196
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"</font>

197
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">not "my lord."</font>

198
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.</font>

199
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.</font>

200
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.</font>

201
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?</font>

202
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

203
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

204
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg pardon, ser.</font>

205
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.</font>

206
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were so brave.
- Brave?</font>

207
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.</font>

208
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it give you joy to scare people?</font>

209
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it gives me joy to kill people.</font>

210
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare me. You can't tell me</font>

211
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.</font>

212
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was his duty. He never liked it.</font>

213
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what he told you?</font>

214
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lied.</font>

215
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing is the sweetest thing there is.</font>

216
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you always so hateful?</font>

217
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen</font>

218
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.</font>

219
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.</font>

220
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are one of the Thirteen.</font>

221
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.</font>

222
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?</font>

223
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're more valuable
than anything in the world.</font>

224
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we look inside my vault</font>

225
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?</font>

226
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will get them back.</font>

227
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?</font>

228
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.</font>

229
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man is what others say he is and no more.</font>

230
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.</font>

231
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.</font>

232
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it did happen under your roof.</font>

233
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been...</font>

234
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care where you've been.</font>

235
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.</font>

236
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...</font>

237
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're free.</font>

238
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,</font>

239
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd shove a spear up his arse.</font>

240
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.</font>

241
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.</font>

243
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.</font>

244
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.</font>

245
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could be free, too.</font>

246
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.</font>

247
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake up when you want to wake up.</font>

248
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.</font>

249
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.</font>

250
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a pretty lad.</font>

251
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.</font>

252
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk.</font>

253
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could teach you how to do it.</font>

254
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to do it.</font>

255
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know nothing, Jon Snow.</font>

256
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did she say?</font>

257
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">She admired your spirit, Your Grace.</font>

258
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what then?</font>

259
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">She...</font>

260
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">if every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,</font>

261
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd all hang.</font>

262
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.</font>

263
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've acted with honor.</font>

264
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thank you for it.</font>

265
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.</font>

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.</font>

267
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.</font>

268
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too many prisoners.</font>

269
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there room for Ser Alton?</font>

270
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he need to lie down?</font>

271
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have the men build him a new pen.</font>

272
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.</font>

273
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have your boy watch over them.</font>

274
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torrhen.</font>

275
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will be all.</font>

276
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

277
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">A minute of your time?</font>

278
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been treating your wounded men.</font>

279
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.</font>

280
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not my enemies.</font>

281
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I tell my bannermen.</font>

282
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.</font>

283
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.</font>

284
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">But some are not.</font>

285
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need silk for stitching.</font>

286
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.</font>

287
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.</font>

288
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.</font>

289
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.</font>

290
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.</font>

291
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Continue, my lady.</font>

292
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?</font>

293
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

294
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.</font>

295
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect he will.</font>

296
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could write a list.</font>

297
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me to the Crag.</font>

298
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that will be...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the maester show you his stores.</font>

300
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the wounded men to be treated well,</font>

301
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the wounded men.</font>

302
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,303

- Come on.</font>

303
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up!</font>

304
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't find anything, ser.</font>

305
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.</font>

306
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.</font>

307
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.</font>

308
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at spending the rest of my life</font>

309
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.</font>

310
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?</font>

311
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.</font>

312
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.</font>

313
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...</font>

314
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's better to be cruel than weak.</font>

315
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prince Theon.</font>

316
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,638

- Who, m'lord?</font>

317
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stark boys. Where are they?</font>

318
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I seen no one.</font>

319
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think harder.</font>

320
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear, m'lord. I don't know.</font>

321
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, over here.</font>

322
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've found what we're looking for.</font>

323
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send the old man home.</font>

324
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back to Winterfell.</font>

325
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him back.</font>

326
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon, don't do this.</font>

327
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.</font>

328
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know anything?</font>

329
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Irri is dead.
- I know.</font>

330
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She was a good...
- She's dead.</font>

331
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.</font>

332
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doreah?</font>

333
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't find her.</font>

334
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must be dead, too.</font>

335
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.</font>

336
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have been here.</font>

337
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went to find me a ship.</font>

338
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">My place is by your side.</font>

339
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.</font>

340
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">"These people"?</font>

341
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are not to be trusted.</font>

342
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who is to be trusted?</font>

343
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are my people?</font>

344
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Targaryens?</font>

345
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only knew one, my brother,</font>

346
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.</font>

347
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki?</font>

348
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.</font>

349
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your people are in Westeros.</font>

350
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.</font>

351
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They will soon enough.
- And then what?</font>

352
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll pray for my return?</font>

353
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?</font>

354
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.</font>

355
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not your brother.</font>

356
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, Khaleesi.</font>

357
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is.</font>

358
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Trust me."</font>

359
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?</font>

360
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only you?</font>

361
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need trust any longer.</font>

362
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want it and I don't have room for it.</font>

363
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.</font>

364
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Khaleesi.</font>

365
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.</font>

366
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help you, please.</font>

367
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me how.</font>

368
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find my dragons.</font>

369
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long till we
get back to your crows?</font>

370
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're close.</font>

371
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, a day? A half-day?</font>

372
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know, do you?</font>

373
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.</font>

374
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?</font>

375
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing happened between you and me.</font>

376
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser,</font>

377
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">"we were only close together for warmth.</font>

378
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club.</font>

his... his...</font>

381
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.</font>

382

383
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And he spread me legs and ruined.</font>

384
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,472

<font color="#FFFFFF">"What will me poor savage father say?"</font>

387
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn back around.</font>

388
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"'Turn back around."'</font>

390
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what, Jon Snow.</font>

391
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since it's gonna be your word against mine,</font>

392
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">and since you can't
talk about it without blushing,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">we may as well just...</font>

394
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, right here in the muck?</font>

395
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll keep you warm enough.</font>

396
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you that afraid of it?</font>

397
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

398
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice</font>

399
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wet</font>

400
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">and warm.</font>

401
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,887

408
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,187

I can have Joffrey's children now.</font>

415
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother might have prepared you.</font>

416
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You flowered, my dear. No more.</font>

417
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother told me,
but I thought it would be different.</font>

418
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">In what way?</font>

419
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it would be less...</font>

420
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less messy.</font>

421
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait until you birth a child.</font>

422
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?</font>

423
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fit to bear children for the king?</font>

424
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">A prospect that once delighted you,</font>

425
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,</font>

426
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">the greatest honor for a queen.</font>

428
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,848

to bring him into this world.</font>

429
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot imagine the pain.</font>

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.</font>

432
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert was hunting.</font>

433
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was his custom.</font>

00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever my time was near,</font>

435
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:15,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.</font>

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,</font>

437
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I would present him with a baby.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I wanted him there, mind you.</font>

439
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.</font>

440
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they told Jaime
he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,</font>

441
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">he smiled</font>

442
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.</font>

443
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey will show you no such devotion.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You may never love the king,</font>

445
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you will love his children.</font>

446
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love His Grace with all my heart.</font>

447
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so very touching to hear.</font>

448
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.</font>

449
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more people you love,
the weaker you are.</font>

450
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.</font>

451
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.</font>

452
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love no one but your children.</font>

453
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">On that front, a mother has no choice.</font>

454
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?</font>

455
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can try,</font>

456
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">little dove.</font>

457
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did you say your mother was again?</font>

458
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinda Lannister.</font>

459
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she the fat one?</font>

460
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, perhaps she's
gotten a little larger than she...</font>

461
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.</font>

462
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she was your mother, you'd know it.</font>

463
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I squired for you once, you know.</font>

464
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">When?</font>

465
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.</font>

466
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to Willem Frey's wedding?</font>

467
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did.</font>

468
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.</font>

469
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?</font>

470
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bryan.</font>

471
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor lad.</font>

472
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.</font>

473
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember you.</font>

474
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd never squired for anyone before.</font>

475
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."</font>

476
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was furious.</font>

477
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the Family.</font>

478
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't, though.</font>

479
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really remember?</font>

480
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.</font>

481
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of my squires,</font>

482
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.</font>

483
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!</font>

484
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were saying?</font>

485
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

486
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind. It's embarrassing.</font>

487
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?</font>

488
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember everything about that day,</font>

489
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">your helmet, your horse,</font>

490
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rake lines in the dirt along the list,</font>

491
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,</font>

492
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.</font>

493
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll remember it all until I die.</font>

494
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the best day of my life.</font>

495
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I remember being on the field
after it was over.</font>

496
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.</font>

497
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I couldn't leave.</font>

498
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast</font>

499
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could barely even see the bride.</font>

500
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,</font>

501
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.</font>

502
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand completely.</font>

503
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you?</font>

504
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I... I didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that I...</font>

505
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 16 once.</font>

506
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.</font>

507
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which knight was it?</font>

508
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barristan Selmy.</font>

509
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.</font>

510
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was he like?</font>

511
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was...</font>

512
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">A painter.</font>

513
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">A painter who only used red.</font>

514
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:26,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not back then.</font>

515
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.</font>

516
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.</font>

517
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to put into words.</font>

518
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like</font>

519
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,</font>

520
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">and finding out that the dream</font>

521
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">is more real than your life.</font>

522
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leaving that battlefield was</font>

523
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">like being dragged off to prison.</font>

524
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you squire for him again?
- No.</font>

525
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have your gift.</font>

526
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.</font>

527
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was awful, a complete liability.</font>

528
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.</font>

529
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good thing I am who I am.</font>

530
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have been useless at anything else.</font>

531
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.</font>

532
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shocking, I know.</font>

533
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some men are.</font>

534
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark,</font>

535
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.</font>

536
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me, though.</font>

537
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.</font>

538
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">And have you thought about...</font>

539
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Every day.</font>

540
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

541
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:10,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.</font>

542
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks are very careful.</font>

543
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is a way, I think.</font>

544
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't possible until now.</font>

545
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

546
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.</font>

547
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll only have to do one thing.</font>

548
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

549
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to die.</font>

550
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jorah the Andal.</font>

551
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man must sail past old Valyria.</font>

552
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.</font>

553
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't come here for lessons.</font>

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you came for the dragons.</font>

555
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have them?</font>

556
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

557
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draw your sword.</font>

558
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what your steel is worth.</font>

559
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to please the Mother of Dragons.</font>

560
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love her.</font>

561
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the dragons?</font>

562
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?</font>

563
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you betray her again?</font>

564
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.</font>

565
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thief you seek</font>

566
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">is with her now.</font>

567
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.</font>

568
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one is calling you a thief.</font>

569
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she to accuse us?</font>

570
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.</font>

571
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begging us? it wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.</font>

572
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without me, the dragons will die.</font>

573
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be for the best.</font>

574
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.</font>

575
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.</font>

576
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are cruel, my friend.</font>

577
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mother of Dragons is in the right.</font>

578
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must be reunited with her babies.</font>

579
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?</font>

580
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.</font>

581
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have my dragons?</font>

582
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.</font>

583
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">He procured them for me.</font>

584
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is no King of Qarth.</font>

585
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.</font>

586
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,</font>

587
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.</font>

588
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will open Qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.</font>

589
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ambition is an inspiration.</font>

590
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">But like all upstarts, you overreach.</font>

591
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan</font>

592
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">do not make you a king.</font>

593
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">An upstart and a charlatan?</font>

594
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Empires have been built by less.</font>

595

<font color="#FFFFFF">Those on the margins
often come to control the center,</font>

596
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.</font>

597
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.</font>

598
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,</font>

in the House of the Undying.</font>

603
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come see them.</font>

604
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lady Stark!
- No farther.</font>

605
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your hands off me, woman.</font>

606
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't enter without an invitation, man.</font>

607
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me. Lady Stark.</font>

608
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.</font>

609
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingslayer!</font>

610
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!
- Hang him!</font>

611

613
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gut him!</font>

614
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back! I want his head!</font>

615
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,972

617
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">this man is our prisoner.</font>

618
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">This monster killed my son.</font>

619
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">And crippled mine.</font>

620
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.</font>

621
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,446

And if you try and stop me...</font>

622
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will strike me down?</font>

623
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you forgotten me, ser?</font>

624
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.</font>

625
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the mother of your king!</font>

626
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.</font>

627
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.</font>

628
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.</font>

629
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!</font>

630
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?</font>

631
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?</font>

632
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.</font>

633
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,</font>

634
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">stand down.</font>

635
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.</font>

636
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wise men do not make demands of kings.</font>

637
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fathers who love their sons do.</font>

638
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have his head.</font>

639
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.</font>

640
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have come to your defense, but...</font>

641
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him to the stockades.</font>

642
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bind him with every chain you can find!</font>

643
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.</font>

644
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not much fish left in you.</font>

645
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">And gag him!</font>

646
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when do you light your own candles?</font>

647
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.</font>

648
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times
can you read one raven scroll?</font>

649
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:29,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.</font>

650
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.</font>

651
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.</font>

652
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have strong, high walls.</font>

653
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll rain fire down on them from above.</font>

654
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting Father, aren't you?</font>

655
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

656
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?</font>

657
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call it tactics, not strategy.</font>

658
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.</font>

659
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.</font>

660
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just you, me and Joffrey,</font>

661
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.</font>

662
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.</font>

663
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to start acting like a king.</font>

664
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.</font>

665
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...</font>

666
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.</font>

667
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the girls might help him.</font>

668
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you?
- I was wrong.</font>

669
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can't control him...</font>

670
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I haven't tried?</font>

671
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't listen to me.</font>

672
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.</font>

673
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.</font>

674
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks like him.</font>

675
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a certain light.</font>

676
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy is more Robert than Jaime.</font>

677
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.</font>

678
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I wonder.</font>

679
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

680
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is the price</font>

681
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">for what we've done,</font>

682
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">for our sins.</font>

683
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sins?</font>

684
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Targaryens...</font>

685
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.</font>

686
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.</font>

687
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.</font>

688
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?</font>

689
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the saying?</font>

690
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."</font>

691
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've beaten the odds.</font>

692
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.</font>

693
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.</font>

694
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's not a king.
- That's treason.</font>

695
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is saving Lannisters, yeah?</font>

696
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.</font>

697
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your son returns at dawn, my lady?</font>

698
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they say.</font>

699
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kingslayer won't last the night.</font>

700
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.</font>

701
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the Karstarks draw their swords...</font>

702
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to die defending a Lannister?</font>

703
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

704
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll not be making it through the night.</font>

705
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be alone with him.</font>

706
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,</font>

707
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">are to leave me alone with him.</font>

708
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?</font>

709
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it's my last night in this world.</font>

710
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a woman?</font>

711
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear them out there?</font>

712
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want your head.</font>

713
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.</font>

714
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">You strangled his son with your chains.</font>

715
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh.</font>

716
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he the one on guard duty?</font>

717
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was in my way.</font>

718
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.</font>

719
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have forsaken every vow you ever took.</font>

720
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many vows.</font>

721
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">They make you swear and swear.</font>

722
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,</font>

723
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">protect the innocent, defend the weak.</font>

724
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if your father despises the king?</font>

725
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the king massacres the innocent?</font>

726
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too much.</font>

727
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.</font>

728
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find this beast?</font>

729
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is a truer knight than you will ever be,</font>

730
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.</font>

731
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a king he was.</font>

732
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,</font>

733
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm,</font>

734
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to the sword I shoved in his back.</font>

735
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a man without honor.</font>

736
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know,</font>

737
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been with any woman but Cersei.</font>

738
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in my own way,</font>

739
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have more honor than</font>

740
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">poor old dead Ned.</font>

741
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?</font>

742
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,343
