00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod!</font>

3
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find Bronn or Varys.</font>

4
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.</font>

5
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them I am very much alive.</font>

6
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

7
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like something for the pain?</font>

8
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

9
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon</font>

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.</font>

11
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

12
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are your new chambers.</font>

13
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little cramped, perhaps,
but you don't need much room, do you?</font>

14
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no longer Hand of the King.</font>

15
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your trouble.</font>

16
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon,
first of my name,</font>

17
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,</font>

18
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,</font>

19
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">do hereby proclaim my grandfather,</font>

20
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city
and the Hand of the King.</font>

21
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Your Grace.</font>

22
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.</font>

23
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your good service and ingenuity</font>

24
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,</font>

25
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I declare that you shall be granted
the castle of Harrenhal</font>

26
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">with all its attendant lands and incomes</font>

27
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be held by your sons and grandsons
from this day until the end of time.</font>

28
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.</font>

29
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.</font>

30
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras Tyrell.</font>

31
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your house has come to our aid.</font>

32
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole realm is in your debt,
none more so than I.</font>

33
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your family would ask anything of me,
ask it,</font>

34
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it shall be yours.</font>

35
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

36
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">my sister Margaery,
her husband was taken from us before...</font>

37
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">She remains innocent.</font>

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honor</font>

39
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">of joining our houses.</font>

40
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?</font>

41
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all my heart, Your Grace.</font>

42
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have come to love you from afar.</font>

43
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tales of your courage and wisdom
have never been far from my ears.</font>

44
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">And those tales have taken root
deep inside of me.</font>

45
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, too, have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,</font>

46
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.</font>

47
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be an honor to return your love,</font>

48
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I am promised to another.</font>

49
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">A king must keep his word.</font>

50
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

51
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the judgment of your Small Council,
it would be neither proper nor wise</font>

52
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,</font>

53
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:38,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.</font>

54
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the good of the realm,
your councilors beg you</font>

55
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">to set Sansa Stark aside.</font>

56
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!</font>

57
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to heed your wishes
and the wishes of my people,</font>

58
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I took a holy vow.</font>

59
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

60
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,</font>

61
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your father, blessed be his memory,</font>

62
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:20,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">made this pact before the Starks
revealed their falseness.</font>

63
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have consulted with the High Septon</font>

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he assures me
that their crimes against the realm</font>

65
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">free you from any promise
you have made to them</font>

66
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the sight of the gods.</font>

67
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods are good.</font>

68
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am free to heed my heart.</font>

69
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.</font>

70
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be my queen</font>

71
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will love you from this day
until my last day.</font>

72
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

73
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sincerest condolences.</font>

74
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're right. I'm not good enough for him.</font>

75
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't say that.</font>

76
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be good enough for many things.</font>

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll still enjoy beating you.</font>

78
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now that you're a woman,</font>

79
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.</font>

80
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, if he's not marrying me...</font>

81
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll let you go home?</font>

82
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.</font>

83
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a tender heart,
just like your mother did at your age.</font>

84
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see so much of her in you.</font>

85
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was like a sister to me.</font>

86
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">For her sake, I'll help get you home.</font>

87
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Landing is my home now.</font>

88
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around you.</font>

89
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all liars here.</font>

90
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every one of us is better than you.</font>

91
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

92
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make yourself comfortable.</font>

93
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't look very comfortable.</font>

94
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, watch me.</font>

95
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No need for that, my dear.
- You sure?</font>

96
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most men like what they see.</font>

97
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not like most men.</font>

98
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what most men say.</font>

99
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't want what most men want,</font>

100
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.</font>

101
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like you</font>

102
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">to tell me if working for Lord Baelish
has been all you'd hoped it would be.</font>

103
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have we met?</font>

104
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't remember me if we had?</font>

105
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meet a lot of men.</font>

106
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think you remember all of them.</font>

107
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think your true talents are wasted on them.</font>

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very kind, my lord.</font>

109
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow me to return the favor.</font>

110
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid.</font>

111
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Nothing dangerous down there.</font>

112
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who you are.</font>

113
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, unlike your current employer,
I protect those who work for me.</font>

114
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims
or force them to abuse each other.</font>

115
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know about that?</font>

116
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said you knew who I was.</font>

117
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you, Lord Varys?</font>

118
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger looks at you
and sees a collection of profitable holes.</font>

119
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see a potential partner.</font>

120
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.</font>

121
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a dangerous man.</font>

122
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">But everyone has their weaknesses.</font>

123
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your current employer hides his very well,</font>

124
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not as well as he thinks.</font>

125
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a virgin, I take it?</font>

126
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk.</font>

127
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Childhood must have been awful for you.</font>

128
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you a foot taller than all the boys?</font>

129
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">They laughed at you, called you names?</font>

130
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some boys like a challenge.</font>

131
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">One or two must have tried
to get inside Big Brienne.</font>

132
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">One or two tried.</font>

133
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

134
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you fought them off.</font>

135
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe you wished one of them could</font>

136
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">overpower you, fling you down,
tear off your clothes.</font>

137
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">But none of them were strong enough.</font>

138
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.</font>

139
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are. You'd love to know
what it feels like to be a woman.</font>

140
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

141
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">"They lay with lions."</font>

142
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tavern girls, I'd say.</font>

143
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably served my father's soldiers.</font>

144
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.</font>

145
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how they earned this.</font>

146
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">The glorious work of
the Northern freedom fighters.</font>

147
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must make you proud to serve the Starks.</font>

148
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't serve the Starks.</font>

149
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve Lady Catelyn.</font>

150
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.</font>

151
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Burying them.</font>

152
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.</font>

153
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think these women would understand if...</font>

154
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what you think.</font>

155
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger.</font>

156
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Untie me. Now!</font>

157
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have me dagger no more.</font>

158
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">So unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,</font>

159
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.</font>

160
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your business here?</font>

161
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traveling a prisoner.</font>

162
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a woman.
- A woman!</font>

163
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, fuck me!</font>

164
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you've quite finished up...</font>

165
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, we'll be going.
- Whoa. Whoa!</font>

166
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you fight for?</font>

167
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks.</font>

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he do?</font>

169
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
- No, stealing is a crime.</font>

170
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.</font>

171
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you taking him?
- To Riverrun.</font>

172
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why Riverrun?</font>

173
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.</font>

174
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?</font>

175
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give the orders.</font>

176
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be important to someone.</font>

177
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sending him with you?
How important could he be?</font>

178
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, have it your way,</font>

179
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">my lady.</font>

180
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?</font>

181
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Then you don't know me.</font>

182
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?</font>

183
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it near Ashemark?
- No.</font>

184
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been there.</font>

185
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think of these beauties?</font>

186
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you gave them quick deaths.</font>

187
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two of them we did, yeah.</font>

188
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

189
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do know you.</font>

190
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Jaime Lannister.</font>

191
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.</font>

192
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.</font>

193
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?</font>

194
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.</font>

195
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">They dragged him out of the woods
and threw him down before the king.</font>

196
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.</font>

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.</font>

198
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a question for you both.</font>

199
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want you to answer it at the same time.</font>

200
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I count to three, you both answer.</font>

201
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's his name?</font>

202
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

203
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two. Three.</font>

204
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two quick deaths.</font>

205
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were Stark men.</font>

206
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't serve the Starks.</font>

207
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve Lady Catelyn.</font>

208
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.</font>

209
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay.</font>

210
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.</font>

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that.</font>

212
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you mean to do it anyway?</font>

213
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love her.</font>

214
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that seems important to you.</font>

215
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is important to me.</font>

216
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father didn't love me when we married.</font>

217
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hardly knew me or I him.</font>

218
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love didn't just happen to us.</font>

219
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We built it slowly over the years,</font>

220
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">stone by stone,</font>

221
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.</font>

222
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,</font>

223
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it is stronger.</font>

224
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It lasts longer.</font>

225
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,</font>

226
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">- what you and father had?
- Why not?</font>

227
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she's not beautiful?</font>

228
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she's not exotic and exciting?</font>

229
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.</font>

230
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you agreed to it.</font>

231
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave him your word.</font>

232
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.</font>

233
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your father lived his life for one thing...</font>

234
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father is dead.</font>

235
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.</font>

236
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you saw my victory in the flames.</font>

237
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

238
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I still see it.
- The flames lied.</font>

239
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm no better than a savage</font>

240
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">trusting in a fire god.</font>

241
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.</font>

242
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell</font>

243
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">as their brothers burned alive, and for what?</font>

244
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attacked from behind
by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.</font>

245
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?</font>

246
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.</font>

247
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You claimed to speak for a god.</font>

248
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?</font>

249
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk about war as if you understand it.</font>

250
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been fighting far longer than you.</font>

251
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you?</font>

252
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me how you fight.</font>

253
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me.</font>

254
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your god now?</font>

255
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will he save you?</font>

256
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your god?</font>

257
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside you.</font>

258
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I murdered my brother.</font>

259
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">We murdered him.</font>

260
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Share the weight with me.</font>

261
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't your brother.</font>

262
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war has just begun.</font>

263
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will last for years.</font>

264
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands will die at your command.</font>

265
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will betray the men serving you.</font>

266
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will betray your family.</font>

267
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will betray everything
you once held dear.</font>

268
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it will all be worth it</font>

269
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you are the Son of Fire.</font>

270
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the Warrior of Light.</font>

271
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.</font>

272
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be king.</font>

273
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promise these things,</font>

274
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't know.</font>

275
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us know.</font>

276
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you.</font>

277
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look into the fire, my king.</font>

278
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

279
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see fire.
- Keep looking.</font>

280
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see?</font>

281
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see, my king?</font>

282
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

283
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill that man.</font>

284
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,</font>

285
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">how many spears they run through me,</font>

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.</font>

287
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want you to know you're surrounded.</font>

288
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I'm surrounded.</font>

289
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that because
I stood on the battlements</font>

290
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and saw I was surrounded.</font>

291
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't want you to sleep.</font>

292
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to sap your spirit before...</font>

293
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, wise bald man.</font>

294
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.</font>

295
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">No word from my father?</font>

296
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

297
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send more ravens.</font>

298
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed all the ravens.</font>

299
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first time I saw Winterfell...</font>

300
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time I saw Winterfell,</font>

301
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">it looked like something
that had been here for thousands of years</font>

302
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.</font>

303
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it and I thought,</font>

304
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.</font>

305
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We never stood a chance against
the man who lives here."</font>

306
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.</font>

307
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:44,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.</font>

308
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:50,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.</font>

309
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:58,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?</font>

310
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be told how much you owe them?</font>

311
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then to go back home
to your real father...</font>

312
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill that man.</font>

313
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to the Drowned God,</font>

314
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Old Gods, the New Gods,</font>

315
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">to every fucking god
in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.</font>

316
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon, listen to me.</font>

317
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve Winterfell.</font>

318
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Winterfell is yours.</font>

319
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bound by oath to serve you.</font>

320
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's your counsel, trusted friend?</font>

321
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run.</font>

322
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five hundred Northmen
wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.</font>

323
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't win.</font>

324
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for nightfall and run.</font>

325
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nowhere to run.</font>

326
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd never make it back to the Iron islands.</font>

327
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:54,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if I did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines and made it home,</font>

328
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be a coward.</font>

329
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Greyjoy who ran.</font>

330
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shame of the family.</font>

331
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go home.</font>

332
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Join the Night's Watch.</font>

333
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once a man has taken the black,</font>

334
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's beyond reach of the law.</font>

335
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All his past crimes are forgiven.</font>

336
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't make it to the Wall.</font>

337
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't make it 10 feet past
the Winterfell gates.</font>

338
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are ways.</font>

339
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.</font>

340
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">The road will be dangerous.</font>

341
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with a little luck...</font>

342
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch
is an ancient, honorable order.</font>

343
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have opportunities there.</font>

344
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.</font>

345
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.</font>

346
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done a lot, haven't I?</font>

347
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things I never imagined myself doing.</font>

348
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.</font>

349
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the man you're pretending to be.</font>

350
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

351
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may be right.</font>

352
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.</font>

353
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that?</font>

354
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the mating call of the Northmen.</font>

355
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to fuck us.</font>

356
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
I'm ready for one.</font>

357
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say every ironborn man
is worth a dozen from the mainland.</font>

358
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

359
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think they're right?
- Aye.</font>

360
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We die today, brothers.</font>

361
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">We die bleeding from 100 wounds</font>

362
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,</font>

363
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">but our war cries will echo through eternity.</font>

364
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will sing about the battle of Winterfell</font>

365
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">until the Iron islands
have slipped beneath the waves.</font>

366
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man, woman
and child will know who we were</font>

367
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how long we stood.</font>

368
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aggar and Gelmarr,</font>

369
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wex and Urzen,</font>

370
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stygg and Black Lorren.</font>

371
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ironborn warriors will cry out our names</font>

372
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.</font>

373
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

374
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!</font>

375
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.</font>

376
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

377
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:09,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower
will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!</font>

378
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

379
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!</font>

380
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought he'd never shut up.</font>

381
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.</font>

382
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

383
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

384
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go home.</font>

385
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

386
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I believe you?</font>

387
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I lie about it?</font>

388
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">To create strife between my sister and me.</font>

389
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where before there was nothing but love.</font>

390
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you
on your sister's orders.</font>

391
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:10,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.</font>

392
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pod.
- Yes, my lord?</font>

393
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:20,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it be excessive of me to ask you
to save my life twice in a week?</font>

394
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, my lord.
- You're a good lad.</font>

395
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get Bronn, tell him</font>

396
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks
outside my door at all times.</font>

397
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
of his command of the City Watch.</font>

398
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands
of your father or your sister.</font>

399
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It varies from cloak to cloak.</font>

400
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.</font>

401
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father paid them quite handsomely.</font>

402
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
for some time, my lord.</font>

403
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?</font>

404
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought we were friends.</font>

405
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are.</font>

406
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Podrick, would you mind?</font>

407
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are many who know that without you
this city faced certain defeat.</font>

408
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king won't give you any honors,</font>

409
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">the histories won't mention you,</font>

410
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we will not forget.</font>

411
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along now, Podrick.</font>

412
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">My love.</font>

413
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was good of you to come.</font>

414
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good of me? Of course I come.</font>

415
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.</font>

416
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you looked?</font>

417
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be the first.</font>

418
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

419
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a mess.</font>

420
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.</font>

421
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You should charge me double.
- You think I'm here for money?</font>

422
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the arrangement we made.</font>

423
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pay you and you lie to me.</font>

424
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

425
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a poor little rich man
and nobody loves me,</font>

426
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I make jokes all the time
and pay them to laugh.</font>

427
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck your money.</font>

428
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's leave.
- Leave?</font>

429
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you.
They will try again.</font>

430
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going into wars, fighting soldiers,
you're terrible at this.</font>

431
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.</font>

432
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't belong here.
- What would we do in Pentos?</font>

433
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat, drink,</font>

434
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">fuck, live.</font>

435
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to go with you.</font>

436
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do it.</font>

437
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father, your sister, all these bad people,
they can't stop you.</font>

438
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget about them. Come with me.</font>

439
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:38,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

440
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do belong here.</font>

441
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">These bad people are what I'm good at.</font>

442
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outtalking them, outthinking them.</font>

443
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I am.</font>

444
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I like it.</font>

445
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it more than anything I've ever done.</font>

446
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to leave?</font>

447
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a shit memory.</font>

448
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am yours and you are mine.</font>

449
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the sight of the Seven,</font>

450
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hereby seal these two souls,</font>

00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,320

454
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,118

- Father, smith...</font>

455

00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. It is known.</font>

460
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the guards?</font>

461
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:01,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.</font>

462
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them try.</font>

463
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a riddle?</font>

464
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:04,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi!</font>

465
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi!</font>

466
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?</font>

467
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me? Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?</font>

00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did he find us?</font>

469
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.</font>

470
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know we'd come this way?</font>

471
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all the things you have seen,
this is your question?</font>

472
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you kill those guards?</font>

473
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it hard?</font>

474
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">No harder than taking a new name,
if you know the way.</font>

475
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me how.</font>

476
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to be able to do it, too.
- If you would learn, you must come with me.</font>

477
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

478
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.</font>

479
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dancing master was from Braavos.</font>

480
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be a dancing master is a special thing,
but to be a faceless man,</font>

481
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is something else entirely.</font>

482
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl has many names on her lips.</font>

483
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,</font>

484
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">llyn Payne, the Hound.</font>

485
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Names to offer up to the Red God.</font>

486
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could offer them all one by one.</font>

487
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to.</font>

488
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't.</font>

489
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to find my brother and mother.</font>

490
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my sister.</font>

491
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to find her, too.</font>

492
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we must part.</font>

493
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man has duties as well.</font>

494
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here.
- What is it?</font>

495
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">A coin of great value.</font>

496
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could it buy a horse?</font>

497
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not meant for the buying of horses.</font>

498
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what good is it?</font>

499
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the day comes
when you must find me again,</font>

500
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">just give that coin to any man from Braavos
and say these words to him,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't go, Jaqen.</font>

504
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaqen is dead.</font>

505
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it again. Valar Morghulis.</font>

506
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valar Morghulis.</font>

507
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

508
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farewell, Arya Stark.</font>

509
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Osha, what are you doing?</font>

510
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.</font>

511
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.</font>

512
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">They burned it down. They burned everything.</font>

513
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everything. Not you.</font>

514
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they may come back. You have to go.</font>

515
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put on your warmest clothes.</font>

516
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pack as much food as you can carry
and go north.</font>

517
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">North's the wrong way.</font>

518
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Mother and brother are south.</font>

519
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know where.</font>

520
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are too many enemies in the south.</font>

521
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the Wall, to Jon.</font>

522
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll look after you
and let your mother know you're safe.</font>

523
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to leave you.</font>

524
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more than I want to leave you.</font>

525
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled you into the world.</font>

526
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of you.</font>

527
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.</font>

528
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for that, I consider myself very,</font>

529
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">very lucky.</font>

530
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go now with Hodor. Go on.</font>

531
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right here.</font>

532
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Osha.</font>

533
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must protect them.</font>

534
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only one who can.</font>

535
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have to protect them
against your own kind.</font>

536
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got no great love for my own kind.</font>

537
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you milk of the poppy.</font>

538
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me where to find it.
- I don't want milk of the poppy.</font>

539
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it quickly.</font>

540
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moon of my life.</font>

541
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is dark magic, like the magic
that took you from me.</font>

542
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took you from me before I could even...</font>

543
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.</font>

544
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.</font>

545
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:39,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands
without you.</font>

546
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:45,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck
himself and came back here to wait for you.</font>

547
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like something you would do.</font>

548
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:04,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream...</font>

549
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not know.</font>

550
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are questions
for wise men with skinny arms.</font>

551
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the moon of my life.</font>

552
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is all I know...</font>

553
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all I need to know.</font>

554
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if this is a dream...</font>

555
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill the man who tries to wake me.</font>

556
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the sun rises in the west
and sets in the east,</font>

557
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">until the rivers run dry</font>

558
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.</font>

559
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">They miss their mother.</font>

560
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to be with you.</font>

561
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to be with them?</font>

562
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be.</font>

563
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:03,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">When your dragons were born,
our magic was born again.</font>

564
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is strongest in their presence.</font>

565
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they are strongest in yours.</font>

566
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be with them,</font>

567
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">through winter, summer,</font>

568
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">winter again.</font>

00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Across a thousand, thousand seasons</font>

570
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will be with them.</font>

571
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.</font>

572
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.</font>

573
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not my home.</font>

574
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">My home is across the sea,
where my people are waiting for me.</font>

575
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be waiting a long time.</font>

576
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dracarys.</font>

577
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should be there by sundown.</font>

578
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.</font>

579
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you know what to say,
you might just make it through the night.</font>

580
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not talking's not the way to go.</font>

581
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful with that.</font>

582
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might cut yourself.</font>

583
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:17,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never swung a sword before, have you?</font>

584
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a baby with a rattle.</font>

585
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of that!</font>

586
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop!
- Why, traitor?</font>

587
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?</font>

588
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let 'em fight.</font>

589
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it? That's what you can do?</font>

590
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little shit.</font>

591
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your traitor father teach you that?</font>

592
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or was it your whore mother?</font>

593
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the watchers on the Wall.</font>

594
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can tell Mance</font>

595
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's the man who killed Qhorin Half hand.</font>

596
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,540

- Aye.</font>

597
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want this one coming back for you.</font>

598

00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.</font>

600
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...</font>
