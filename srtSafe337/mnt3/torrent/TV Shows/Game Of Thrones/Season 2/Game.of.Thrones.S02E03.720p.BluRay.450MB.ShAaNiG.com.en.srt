1
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out, all of you.</font>

2
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!</font>

3
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you and your men</font>

4
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">gone.</font>

5
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will make this right.</font>

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait outside.</font>

7
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord Commander...
- Now!</font>

8
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord Commander...
- Leave us.</font>

9
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?</font>

10
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I followed him.</font>

11
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.</font>

12
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">What business is that of yours?</font>

13
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't understand.</font>

14
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's killing them, all the boys.</font>

15
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.</font>

16
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I.</font>

17
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those boys are Craster's offerings.</font>

18
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offerings?</font>

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.</font>

20
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, many a time
that monster has been the difference</font>

21
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">between life and death for our rangers,</font>

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">your uncle among them.</font>

23
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have other wars to fight out there.</font>

24
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like it or not, we need men like Craster.</font>

25
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

26
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it.</font>

27
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw</font>

28
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">something take that child.</font>

29
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Whatever it was,</font>

30
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I daresay you'll see it again.</font>

31
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, ready my horse.</font>

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We leave at dawn.</font>

33
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't lose it again.</font>

34
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilly.</font>

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're leaving.</font>

36
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I wanted to give you something.</font>

37
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">It belonged to my mother.</font>

38
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't take it.
- Please.</font>

39
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to.</font>

40
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother used it for sewing.</font>

41
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd let me sit with her in her chamber
while she sewed</font>

42
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd read to her.</font>

43
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father put a stop to it when he found out.</font>

44
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only thing I have of hers.</font>

45
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.</font>

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

47
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't give it away.</font>

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not giving it away.</font>

49
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm giving it to you.</font>

50
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it safe for me.</font>

51
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Till I come back.</font>

52
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

53
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.</font>

54
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every night it's the same.</font>

55
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm walking</font>

56
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and running, but...</font>

57
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not... I'm not me.</font>

58
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm running through the godswood,</font>

59
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">sniffing the dirt,</font>

60
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">tasting blood in my mouth
when I've made a fresh kill,</font>

61
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">howling.</font>

62
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old Nan used to tell me stories</font>

63
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">about magical people who could live</font>

64
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">inside stags, birds,</font>

65
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">wolves.</font>

66
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly what they are, Bran,</font>

67
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- stories.
- So she was lying?</font>

68
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.</font>

69
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're gone from the world,</font>

70
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">along with much else.</font>

71
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.</font>

72
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my dreams are different.</font>

73
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine are true.</font>

74
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dreamt of my father dying.</font>

75
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Rickon had the same dream.</font>

76
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about all the dreams you had
that didn't come true?</font>

77
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">This link is made of Valyrian steel.</font>

80
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain.</font>

81
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.</font>

82
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.</font>

83
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was no different.</font>

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was young.</font>

85
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers</font>

86
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">to lift him out of his dull life
into a special one?</font>

87
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in the end, for all my efforts,</font>

88
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got no more out of it
than a thousand boys before me.</font>

89
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

90
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

91
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.</font>

92
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not anymore.</font>

93
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dragons are gone.</font>

94
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">The giants are dead.</font>

95
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Children of the Forest forgotten.</font>

96
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras! Highgarden!</font>

97
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

98
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

99
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yield! I yield.</font>

100
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well fought. Approach.</font>

101
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise. Remove your helm.</font>

102
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are all your father promised
and more, my lady.</font>

103
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,</font>

104
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">but never quite in that fashion.</font>

105
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.</font>

106
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">That he did, my queen.</font>

107
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there can only be one champion.</font>

108
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brienne of Tarth,</font>

109
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may ask anything of me you desire.</font>

110
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it is within my power, it is yours.</font>

111
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

112
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.</font>

113
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

114
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,</font>

115
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">and keep you safe from all harm.</font>

116
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.</font>

117
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.</font>

118
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, I have
the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,</font>

119
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">sent as an envoy
by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.</font>

120
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.</font>

121
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.</font>

122
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I present my wife,
Margaery of House Tyrell?</font>

123
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.</font>

124
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry for your loss.</font>

125
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are most kind.</font>

126
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady,</font>

127
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer
for your husband's murder.</font>

128
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I take King's Landing,</font>

129
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring you Joffrey's head.</font>

130
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be enough
to know that justice was done, my lord.</font>

131
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

132
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you should kneel
when you approach the King.</font>

133
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.</font>

134
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?</font>

135
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not sit on my son's war councils.</font>

136
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I did,
I would not share his strategies with you.</font>

137
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,</font>

138
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">not hide behind his mother's skirts.</font>

139
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.</font>

140
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, my lady.</font>

141
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our war is just beginning.</font>

142
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- Gerard.</font>

143
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.</font>

144
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't know their own size is all.</font>

145
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good man.</font>

146
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have 100,000 men at my command.</font>

147
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.</font>

148
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?</font>

149
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a game to you, isn't it?</font>

150
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I pity them.
- Why?</font>

151
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it won't last.</font>

152
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they are the knights of summer
and winter is coming.</font>

153
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.</font>

154
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's tired from herjourney.
- At once, Your Grace.</font>

155
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.</font>

156
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would pray awhile. Alone.</font>

157
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll follow me, my lady.</font>

158
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.</font>

159
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought for my king.</font>

160
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.</font>

161
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die for him if I must.</font>

162
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.</font>

163
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no lady.</font>

164
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

165
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live here.</font>

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you angry with me, brother?</font>

167
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lying bitch.</font>

168
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.</font>

169
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Recognize you? How could I?</font>

170
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time I saw you...</font>

171
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">you looked like a fat little boy.</font>

172
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a fat little boy, too,</font>

173
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I recognized you.</font>

174
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

175
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to see who you were first.</font>

176
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I did.</font>

177
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plans are made. It's time you heard them.</font>

178
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Father.
- Father.</font>

179
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolf pup has gone south</font>

180
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the entirety
of the Northern army at his back.</font>

181
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,</font>

182
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">the North is ripe for the taking.</font>

183
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,</font>

184
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">all along the northern coast.</font>

185
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,</font>

186
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">securing the Neck and everything above.</font>

187
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.</font>

188
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?</font>

189
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest shall be ours,</font>

190
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">forest, field, and hall.</font>

191
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships</font>

192
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">to attack Deepwood Motte.</font>

193
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted a castle.</font>

194
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's my role in all this?</font>

195
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.</font>

196
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ship?</font>

197
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give her 30 and I get one?</font>

198
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.</font>

199
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm to fight fishermen?</font>

200
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful of their nets.</font>

201
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.</font>

202
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He won't give up the North so easily.
- They won't even know we're there</font>

203
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- until it's too late.
- What do you know of it, woman?</font>

204
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a proven warrior.</font>

205
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead</font>

206
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.</font>

207
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not protecting anyone.</font>

208
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.</font>

209
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?</font>

210
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.</font>

211
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we pledge fealty to them,</font>

212
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll give us Casterly Rock.</font>

213
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are our words?</font>

214
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our words?</font>

215
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We do not sow.
- We do not sow.</font>

216
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are ironborn.</font>

217
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not subjects. We're not slaves.</font>

218
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.</font>

219
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">We take what is ours.</font>

220
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.</font>

221
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You act as if I volunteered to go.</font>

222
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me away, if you remember.</font>

223
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.</font>

224
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">After he crushed you.</font>

225
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you take what was yours then?</font>

226
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me away!</font>

227
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your boy!</font>

228
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your last boy!</font>

229
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me away
like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.</font>

230
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you curse me
because I've come home.</font>

231
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?</font>

232
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no other family.</font>

233
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you?</font>

234
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.</font>

235
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our ships sail with or without you.</font>

236
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't let me leave this room.</font>

237
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You won't let me...
- Keep your voice down.</font>

238
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? You think your father can hear me?</font>

239
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's 300 miles away!</font>

240
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't intend for you to stay here.</font>

241
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.</font>

242
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, only temporary.</font>

243
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.</font>

244
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you wouldn't be a cook.</font>

245
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd pose as a scullion.</font>

246
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scullion? What is a scullion?</font>

247
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitchen wench.</font>

248
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...</font>

249
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?</font>

250
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lion wants to see you alive.</font>

251
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come to a dangerous place.</font>

252
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister wants to hurt me.</font>

253
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll look for any weakness she can find.</font>

254
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't know about you.</font>

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the weakness?</font>

256
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a compliment, my lady.</font>

257
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is being a weakness a compliment?</font>

258
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Language can be a bit tricky here.</font>

259
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

260
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm too stupid to understand.</font>

261
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stupid foreign girl.</font>

262
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not a kitchen wench.</font>

263
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?</font>

264
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon, darling, when the war is over.</font>

265
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony</font>

266
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">and another for the feast.</font>

267
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.</font>

268
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Princess just spoke to you.</font>

269
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon, Your Grace.</font>

270
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.</font>

271
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done</font>

272
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can pledge
my love to the King in sight of the gods.</font>

273
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?</font>

274
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might.</font>

275
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like that?</font>

276
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I don't think so.</font>

277
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.</font>

278
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't you, little dove?</font>

279
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

280
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

281
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.</font>

282
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.</font>

283
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not from here.
- No.</font>

284
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

285
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waiting for you to tell me what to do.</font>

286
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.</font>

287
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">What things?</font>

288
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change my linens, wash my clothing,</font>

289
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.</font>

290
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You said to brush...</font>

291
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now.</font>

292
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your chamber pot is empty.</font>

293
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clean the table.</font>

294
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever been a handmaiden before?</font>

295
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- For whom?</font>

296
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?</font>

297
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Zuriff.</font>

298
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.</font>

299
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't in this city.</font>

300
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how they did things in that city,</font>

301
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,</font>

302
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">not the other way around.</font>

303
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions</font>

304
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">and teach you how to do your job.</font>

305
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me to leave?</font>

306
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just brush my hair.</font>

307
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

308
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank the gods.</font>

309
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had a proper shit in six days.</font>

310
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.</font>

311
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stresses of power often have this</font>

312
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">insalubrious effect.</font>

313
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two drops with water, daily.</font>

314
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. I'm so grateful to have a man</font>

315
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.</font>

316
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Thank you, my lord.</font>

317
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?</font>

318
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, yes, of course, my lord.</font>

319
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are perilous times.</font>

320
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the crown must forge new alliances.</font>

321
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.</font>

322
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matrimony, huh?</font>

323
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

324
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.</font>

325
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't have her meddling in affairs</font>

326
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">that could determine the future of the realm.
There's too much at stake.</font>

327
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.</font>

328
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall be silent as the grave.</font>

329
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.</font>

330
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,</font>

331
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">ensuring their loyalty</font>

332
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their army, should we need it.</font>

333
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrcella sent away to Dorne?</font>

334
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">But remember, the Queen mustn't know.</font>

335
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

336
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Queen mustn't know."</font>

337
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love conversations that begin this way.</font>

338
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off</font>

339
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Theon Greyjoy.</font>

340
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon Greyjoy?</font>

341
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, my lord, but how?</font>

342
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">He grew up a ward of Winterfell.</font>

343
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He fights for Robb Stark.
- Precisely.</font>

344
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon's father loathes the Starks
and will convince the boy to come to our side.</font>

345
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within</font>

346
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can have his father's ships.</font>

347
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">But remember, you must tell no one.</font>

348
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell no one what?</font>

349
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I plan to wed Princess Myrcella
to Robin Arryn of the Vale.</font>

350
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lysa is not fond of me.</font>

351
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:44,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.</font>

352
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.</font>

353
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you offer her son a princess?</font>

354
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">For men in our position,
holding grudges can be</font>

355
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">an encumbrance, don't you think?</font>

356
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?</font>

357
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who better?</font>

358
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,
if I cared to.</font>

359
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in it for me?</font>

360
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war,</font>

361
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">the adoration of the King
for bringing the Vale back into the fold...</font>

362
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Harrenhal.</font>

363
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harrenhal is cursed.</font>

364
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never took you for a superstitious man.</font>

365
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.</font>

366
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.</font>

367
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a single stroke, you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.</font>

368
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.</font>

369
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did Janos Slynt,
and he was given Harrenhal, too.</font>

370
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until you snatched it away.</font>

371
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.</font>

372
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't need Janos Slynt.</font>

373
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's settled, then?</font>

374
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

375
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. And remember...</font>

376
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Queen mustn't know.</font>

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">That must hurt.</font>

378
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

379
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

380
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">A member of the Kingsguard?</font>

381
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.</font>

382
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brienne is a very capable warrior.</font>

383
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's devoted to me.</font>

384
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're jealous.</font>

385
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jealous?</font>

386
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of Brienne the Beauty?</font>

387
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make me laugh.</font>

388
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.</font>

389
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not tonight.</font>

390
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.</font>

391
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:52,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.</font>

392
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.</font>

393
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.</font>

394
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Margaery's a virgin?</font>

395
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officially.</font>

396
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I bring her to you?</font>

397
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.</font>

398
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">As is your right. You are a king.</font>

399
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look very beautiful.</font>

400
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Your Grace.</font>

401
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a lovely gown.
- You think so?</font>

402
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't decide how I like it better.</font>

403
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way,</font>

404
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">or this way.</font>

405
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You certainly don't need it.</font>

406
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, some say the beauty most desired</font>

407
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the beauty concealed.</font>

408
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be the wine.</font>

409
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, let me.</font>

410
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

411
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want my brother to come in and help?</font>

412
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- He could get you started.</font>

413
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he wouldn't mind.</font>

414
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.</font>

415
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

416
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need for us to play games.</font>

417
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.</font>

418
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your enemies aren't happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.</font>

419
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the best way to stop them</font>

420
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to put your baby</font>

421
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my belly.</font>

422
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can try again later.</font>

423
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You decide how you want to do it,
with me, with me and Loras,</font>

424
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">however else you like.</font>

425
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you need to do.</font>

426
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a king.</font>

427
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">You monster.</font>

428
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrcella is my only daughter.</font>

429
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
I'll let you sell her like a common whore?</font>

430
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrcella's a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.</font>

431
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.</font>

432
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dorne is the safest place for her.</font>

433
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.</font>

434
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we need to seduce them.</font>

435
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to need their support in the war
your son started.</font>

436
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.</font>

437
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't get away with this.</font>

438
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think the piece of paper Father gave you
keeps you safe.</font>

439
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.</font>

440
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's done, Cersei.
- No.</font>

441
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You cannot stop it.
- No!</font>

442
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just how safe do you think Myrcella is
if this city falls?</font>

443
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?</font>

444
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make no mistake.</font>

445
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike
right beside yours.</font>

446
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out! Get out!</font>

447
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon of the House Greyjoy,</font>

448
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would this day
consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?</font>

449
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I would.
- Kneel.</font>

450
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let Theon, your servant,</font>

451
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">be born again from the sea as you were.</font>

452
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bless him with salt.</font>

453
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bless him with stone.</font>

454
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bless him with steel.</font>

455
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is dead may never die.</font>

456
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">But rises again harder and stronger.</font>

457
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand.</font>

458
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't appreciate
being made a fool of, dwarf.</font>

459
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,</font>

460
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?</font>

461
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, afraid not. Sorry about that.</font>

462
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Harrenhal,</font>

463
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose that's off the table as well.</font>

464
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.</font>

465
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me out of your next deception.</font>

466
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a shame.</font>

467
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were to be
the centerpiece of my next deception.</font>

468
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.</font>

469
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would see him released.
That's where you come in.</font>

470
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.</font>

471
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he won't. But his mother might.</font>

472
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?</font>

473
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Find him?
- Oh, aye.</font>

474
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he has company.</font>

475
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.</font>

476
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.</font>

477
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

478
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the meaning of this?</font>

479
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please, please.</font>

480
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You disappoint me, Grand Maester.</font>

481
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your loyal servant.</font>

482
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:29,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">So loyal that you told the Queen
about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.</font>

483
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Never!</font>

484
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a falsehood. I swear it.</font>

485
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't me.</font>

486
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Varys.</font>

487
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Varys the Spider.</font>

488
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I told Varys that
I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.</font>

489
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told Littlefinger
that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.</font>

490
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told no one
that I was offering her to the Dornish.</font>

491
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one but you.</font>

492
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">The eunuch has spies everywhere.</font>

493
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.</font>

494
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, half man.</font>

495
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, make do.</font>

496
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you been spying for my sister?</font>

497
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I did, I did for House Lannister.</font>

498
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always. Your lord father, ask him.</font>

499
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:17,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always been his servant
since the days of the Mad King.</font>

500
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't like his beard.
- What?</font>

501
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No. No.</font>

502
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?</font>

503
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?</font>

504
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Arryn, he knew.</font>

505
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew the truth about the Queen.</font>

506
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:43,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... he planned to act, to tell King Robert.</font>

507
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you poisoned him?</font>

508
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Never.</font>

509
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.</font>

510
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lannister... I always served Lannister.</font>

511
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.</font>

512
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no. No, please.</font>

513
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't! You can't do this to me!</font>

514
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your trouble.</font>

515
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend</font>

516
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.</font>

517
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. One of my better ideas.</font>

518
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:40,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it seems the Grand Maester
has found his way into a black cell?</font>

519
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well played, My Lord Hand.</font>

520
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">But should I be worried?</font>

521
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Janos Slynt, Pycelle...</font>

522
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Small Council grows smaller every day.</font>

523
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.</font>

524
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.</font>

525
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power is a curious thing, my lord.</font>

526
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you fond of riddles?</font>

527
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, am I about to hear one?</font>

528
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three great men sit in a room.</font>

529
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">A king, a priest and a rich man.</font>

530
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between them stands a common sellsword.</font>

531
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each great man
bids the sellsword kill the other two.</font>

532
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who lives, who dies?</font>

533
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Depends on the sellsword.</font>

534
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it? He has neither crown
nor gold nor favor with the gods.</font>

535
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a sword, the power of life and death.</font>

536
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it's swordsmen who rule,
why do we pretend kings hold all the power?</font>

537
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Ned Stark lost his head,
who was truly responsible?</font>

538
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey? The executioner?
Or something else?</font>

539
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided I don't like riddles.</font>

540
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power resides where men believe it resides.</font>

541
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.</font>

542
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a very small man
can cast a very large shadow.</font>

543
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be sleeping.</font>

544
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow's a long march.</font>

545
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.</font>

546
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep.</font>

547
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like the taste.</font>

548
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.</font>

549
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

550
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you sleep?</font>

551
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as most men, I think.</font>

552
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've seen things,</font>

553
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">horrible things.</font>

554
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

555
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen some pretty things, too,</font>

556
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not nearly so many.</font>

557
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you sleep when you...</font>

558
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:53,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you have those things in your head?</font>

559
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't see that.</font>

560
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made damn sure.</font>

561
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I close my eyes and I see them up there.</font>

562
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of them</font>

563
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">standing there.</font>

564
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey,</font>

565
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Queen and...</font>

566
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my sister.</font>

567
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we've got
something in common, me and you.</font>

568
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that?</font>

569
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must have been</font>

570
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">a couple of years older than you.</font>

571
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw my brother stabbed through the heart</font>

572
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">right on our doorstep.</font>

573
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.</font>

574
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem, the lad's name was.</font>

575
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">He ran off before anyone could spit.</font>

576
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just stood there,</font>

577
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">watching my brother die.</font>

578
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the funny part.</font>

579
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't picture my brother's face anymore.</font>

580
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Willem,</font>

581
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, he was a nice-looking boy.</font>

582
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had good white teeth, blue eyes,</font>

583
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.</font>

584
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would think about him when I was working,</font>

585
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.</font>

586
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">It got to the point</font>

587
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I would say his name every night
before I went to bed.</font>

588
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem. Willem.</font>

589
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem.</font>

590
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">A prayer almost.</font>

591
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, one day,</font>

592
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem came riding back into town.</font>

593
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:05,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull
they had to bury him with it.</font>

594
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:13,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willem's horse got me to the Wall
and I've been wearing black ever since.</font>

595
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll help you sleep, eh?</font>

596
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho!</font>

597
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, you lazy sons of whores!</font>

598
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arm yourselves.</font>

599
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get up.
- Get up.</font>

600
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep out of sight, both of you.</font>

601
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.</font>

602
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep out of sight.</font>

603
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">If things go wrong, you run.</font>

604
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?
You run along north and don't look back.</font>

605
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, there's men out there
who want to fuck your corpses.</font>

606
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outside, now!</font>

607
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, move, move!</font>

608
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gold cloaks!</font>

609
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone out!</font>

610
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:20,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you! Open the damn cage!</font>

611
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the bastard, crow?</font>

612
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?</font>

613
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Amory Lorch,
sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.</font>

614
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men from the capital
requested our assistance.</font>

615
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapons in the name of the King.</font>

616
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, which king would that be?</font>

617
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your last chance.</font>

618
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:46,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.</font>

619
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I will.</font>

620
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">So be it.</font>

621
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.</font>

622
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, come here. Boy!</font>

623
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!</font>

624
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help us, boy!</font>

625
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man can fight! Free us!</font>

626
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick, give it to me.</font>

627
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the ax. Give me that.</font>

628
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put them on the wagon!</font>

629
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more here. Come on.</font>

630
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we have here?</font>

631
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

632
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a fine little blade.</font>

633
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.</font>

634
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I yield! I yield!</font>

635
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Round up any survivors.</font>

636
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll take them back to Harrenhal.</font>

637
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard him. You're coming with us.</font>

638
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I yield!</font>

639
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

640
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

641
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something wrong with your leg, boy?</font>

642
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at it.</font>

643
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you walk?</font>

644
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You got to carry me.</font>

645
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

646
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Carry him," he says.</font>

647
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.</font>

648
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him up</font>

649
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll start taking eyeballs.</font>

650
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:02,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want Gendry?</font>

651
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already got him.</font>

652
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved that helmet.</font>
