<font color="#FFFFFF">Well struck, dog.</font>

00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you like that?</font>

4
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was well struck, Your Grace.</font>

5
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already said it was well struck.</font>

6
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,191

<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Your Grace.</font>

14
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">My deepest apologies.</font>

15
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you drunk?
- No.</font>

16
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, Your Grace.</font>

- Two cups?</font>

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not much at all.</font>

19
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, have another cup.</font>

20
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure, Your Grace?</font>

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. To celebrate my name day.</font>

22
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have two. Have as much as you like.</font>

23
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would be honored, Your Grace.</font>

24
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.</font>

25
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">See that he drinks his fill.</font>

26
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't.</font>

27
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

28
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you say I can't?</font>

29
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only meant</font>

30
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.</font>

31
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...</font>

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl is right.</font>

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.</font>

34
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him away.</font>

35
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.</font>

36
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.</font>

37
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll make a much better fool than a knight.</font>

38
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.</font>

39
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?</font>

40
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">From this day, you'll be my new fool.</font>

41
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Your Grace.</font>

42
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, my lady, thank you.</font>

43
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beloved nephew.</font>

44
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">We looked for you on the battlefield.</font>

45
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were nowhere to be found.</font>

46
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.</font>

47
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a fine job you've done.</font>

48
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.</font>

49
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">More beautiful than ever.</font>

50
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you!</font>

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be bigger than the Hound,</font>

52
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">but much better looking.</font>

53
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one doesn't like me.</font>

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't imagine why.</font>

55
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.</font>

56
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,</font>

57
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.</font>

58
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.</font>

59
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her loss?</font>

60
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her father was a confessed traitor.</font>

61
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">But still her father.</font>

62
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathize.</font>

63
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was a traitor.</font>

64
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother and brother are traitors, too.</font>

65
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.</font>

66
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are.</font>

67
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.</font>

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wish I could stay and celebrate,</font>

69
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there is work to be done.</font>

70
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">What work?</font>

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, Your Grace.</font>

73
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The conclave has met,</font>

74
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">considered reports from maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,</font>

75
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">and declared this great summer</font>

76
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">done at last.</font>

77
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">The longest summer in living memory.</font>

78
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.</font>

79
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">A common superstition.</font>

80
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.</font>

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it lasts any longer,</font>

82
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll have fewer peasants.</font>

83
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.</font>

84
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.</font>

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?</font>

86
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do, Your Grace.</font>

87
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are you not a lord at my command?</font>

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.</font>

89
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.</font>

90
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">They belong in the field, not our capital.</font>

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Your Grace.</font>

92
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get up.</font>

93
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">More ravishing than ever, big sister.</font>

94
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">War agrees with you.</font>

95
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive the interruption. Carry on.</font>

96
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a remarkable journey.</font>

98
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pissed off the edge of the Wall,</font>

99
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I slept in a sky cell,</font>

100
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought with the hill tribes.</font>

101
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many adventures,</font>

102
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">so much to be thankful for.</font>

103
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
This is the small council.</font>

104
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King
is welcome at all small council meetings.</font>

105
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our father is Hand of the King.</font>

106
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but in his absence...</font>

107
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father has named Lord Tyrion</font>

108
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.</font>

109
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out! All of you out!</font>

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to know
how you tricked Father into this.</font>

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were capable of tricking Father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.</font>

112
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought this on yourself.</font>

113
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done nothing.</font>

114
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite right, you did nothing</font>

115
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">when your son called for Ned Stark's head.</font>

116
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the entire North has risen up against us.</font>

117
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.</font>

118
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.</font>

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.</font>

120
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand we're losing the war?</font>

121
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.</font>

122
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know people.</font>

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.</font>

124
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.</font>

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are here to advise him.</font>

126
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only here to advise him.</font>

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the king listens to what I say,</font>

128
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.</font>

129
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

130
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love your children.</font>

131
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.</font>

132
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks love their children as well.</font>

133
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And we have two of them.
- One.</font>

134
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.</font>

135
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?</font>

136
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had three Starks to trade.</font>

137
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.</font>

138
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father will be furious.</font>

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be odd for you</font>

140
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be the disappointing child.</font>

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother</font>

142
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all our Northern sons.</font>

143
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.</font>

144
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,</font>

145
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.</font>

146
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a boy,</font>

147
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</font>

148
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men worked back then.</font>

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.</font>

150
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.</font>

151
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods forbid it rains.</font>

152
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.</font>

153
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.</font>

154
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Generally, yes,</font>

155
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've sent all the young men off
to fight Robb Stark's war.</font>

156
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robb. And it's not his war.</font>

157
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't choose it.</font>

158
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.</font>

159
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey killed my father,</font>

160
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">your liege lord.</font>

161
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember your vows, ser?</font>

162
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I remember!</font>

163
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.</font>

164
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?</font>

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it will.</font>

166
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't want him here all day, did we?</font>

167
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.</font>

168
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor did I.</font>

169
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to</font>

170
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.</font>

171
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Portan.</font>

172
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother</font>

173
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all our Northern sons.</font>

174
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.</font>

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes all your pain go away.</font>

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't have any pain.</font>

177
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky for you.</font>

178
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way.</font>

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been having those dreams again.</font>

180
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't dream.</font>

181
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone dreams.</font>

182
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't.</font>

183
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.</font>

184
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say it's an omen.</font>

185
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say it means Robb
will win a great victory in the South.</font>

186
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they?</font>

187
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister Red.</font>

188
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Means the Lannisters
will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.</font>

189
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood</font>

190
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">to mark the death of your father.</font>

191
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stars don't fall for men.</font>

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red comet means one thing, boy.</font>

193
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragons.</font>

194
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dragons are all dead.</font>

195
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been dead for centuries.</font>

196
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

197
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?</font>

198
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said they ate meat.</font>

199
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't tell you what kind of meat?</font>

200
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.</font>

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't know anything about anything.</font>

202
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh.</font>

203
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was Drogo's first gift to me.</font>

204
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember.</font>

205
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised to protect them.</font>

206
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.</font>

207
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I make starvation scream?</font>

208
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.</font>

209
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it ever end?</font>

210
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is further east than I've ever been.</font>

211
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.</font>

212
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're sure there's no other way?</font>

213
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,</font>

214
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.</font>

215
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,</font>

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.</font>

217
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will take my dragons.</font>

218
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are too weak to fight,</font>

219
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">as are your people.</font>

220
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be their strength.</font>

221
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you are mine.</font>

222
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.</font>

223
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.</font>

224
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we seek, Khaleesi?</font>

225
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:05,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.</font>

226
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.</font>

227
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakharo.</font>

228
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my last hope, blood of my blood.</font>

229
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not fail you, blood of my blood.</font>

230
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never have.</font>

231
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bad time to start.</font>

232
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having a rough time of it?</font>

233
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's killed me yet.</font>

234
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.</font>

235
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.</font>

236
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born in a place like this.</font>

237
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later, I fell on hard times.</font>

238
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are those girls?</font>

239
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster's daughters.</font>

240
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen a girl in six months.</font>

241
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.</font>

242
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?</font>

243
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">He don't like people messing with his wives.</font>

244
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.</font>

245
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on and on it goes.</font>

246
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.</font>

247
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.</font>

248
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster's still here.</font>

249
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be doing something right.</font>

250
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens to the boys?</font>

251
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

252
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">He marries his daughters.</font>

253
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he do with his sons?</font>

254
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.</font>

255
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">People make all sorts of plans.</font>

256
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.</font>

257
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't missed him.</font>

258
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always treated me like scum.</font>

259
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't had any good wine for a long time.</font>

260
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.</font>

261
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not Southerners.</font>

262
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's this little girl?</font>

263
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're prettier than half my daughters.</font>

264
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a nice wet twat between your legs?</font>

265
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

266
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?</font>

267
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, bastard.</font>

268
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.</font>

269
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now you're in the North, the real North.</font>

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lad meant no harm.</font>

271
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...</font>

272
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.</font>

273
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, sit down and shut your mouth.</font>

274
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bring any of that good wine with you?</font>

275
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did.</font>

276
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">We passed through
six villages on the way here.</font>

277
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">All six were abandoned.</font>

278
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have all the wildlings gone?</font>

279
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.</font>

280
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.</font>

281
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bring it in here.
Yes, Commander.</font>

282
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know
where they've all gone?</font>

283
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">North, to join up with Mance Rayder.</font>

284
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your old friend.</font>

285
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's no friend of mine.</font>

286
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.</font>

287
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">But once he was just a poor black crow.</font>

288
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.</font>

289
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been calling himself that for years.</font>

290
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?</font>

291
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good-looking ax.</font>

292
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fresh forged?</font>

293
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it here.</font>

294
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have another one made at Castle Black.</font>

295
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

296
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's some lovely steel.</font>

297
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?</font>

298
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gathering an army.</font>

299
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your Southern Kings.</font>

300
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where does he plan marching this army?</font>

301
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.</font>

302

you jealous, old man,</font>

311
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,885

and you with no one to warm your bed?</font>

312
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">We chose different paths.</font>

313
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,</font>

316
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">A roof would be welcome.</font>

317
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,902

321
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I see this one staring too long,</font>

322
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,297

330
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,960

344
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,073

345
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smell of fear,</font>

451
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.</font>

452
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have proof?</font>

453
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?</font>

454
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:25,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.</font>

455
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?</font>

456
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know him very well.</font>

457
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but he's starting to know me.</font>

458
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three victories don't make you a conqueror.</font>

459
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better than three defeats.</font>

460
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">This city stinks.</font>

461
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like dead bodies.</font>

462
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit corpsey, yes.</font>

463
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">And shit.</font>

464
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you wanted to come here.</font>

465
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it.</font>

466
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?</font>

467
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">And cum and garlic and rum.</font>

468
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can smell cum from the balcony?</font>

469
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love the stink. I love the noise.</font>

470
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cities make me want to fuck.</font>

471
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so did the country.</font>

472
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where I belong.</font>

473
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, you need to be careful.</font>

474
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can know you're here.</font>

475
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will know.</font>

476
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.</font>

477
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,</font>

478
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">one or two great liars.</font>

479
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

480
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.</font>

481
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truth?</font>

482
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.</font>

483
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think I am so little?</font>

484
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.</font>

485
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark actually slept on this.</font>

486
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.</font>

487
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.</font>

488
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish.</font>

489
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

490
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.</font>

491
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Your Grace.</font>

492
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,</font>

493
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can't seem to locate her.</font>

494
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.</font>

495
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.</font>

496
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curious.</font>

497
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,</font>

498
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...</font>

499
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.</font>

500
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you could ask Varys where she is.</font>

501
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll have an answer for you.</font>

502
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whether you believe it...</font>

503
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.</font>

504
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows what they want?</font>

505
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">A mockingbird.</font>

506
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.</font>

507
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.</font>

508
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you like it.</font>

509
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.</font>

510
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Others have to find their own way.</font>

511
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a song once</font>

512
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a boy of modest means</font>

513
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.</font>

514
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved the eldest daughter.</font>

515
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, she had eyes for another.</font>

516
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.</font>

517
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.</font>

518
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when those affections
become common knowledge,</font>

519
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, that is an awkward situation indeed,</font>

520
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially in a prominent family.</font>

521
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,</font>

522
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've found.</font>

523
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And which truth is that?</font>

524
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowledge is power.</font>

525
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seize him.</font>

526
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut his throat.</font>

527
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Wait.</font>

528
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've changed my mind. Let him go.</font>

529
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step back three paces.</font>

530
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

531
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes.</font>

532
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power is power.</font>

533
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores</font>

534
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">to locate the Stark girl for me.</font>

535
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would very much appreciate it.</font>

536
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Ser Alton Lannister?</font>

537
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am, Your Grace.</font>

538
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.</font>

539
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, your family must release my sisters.</font>

540
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us</font>

541
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:51,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.</font>

542
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.</font>

543
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.</font>

544
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...</font>

545
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.</font>

546
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.</font>

547
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">The King in the North.</font>

548
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- King in the North.
- King in the North.</font>

549
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.</font>

550
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he disregards this command,</font>

551
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">he shall suffer the same fate as my father,</font>

552
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.</font>

553
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are... Your Grace, these are...</font>

554
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my terms.</font>

555
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.</font>

556
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not,</font>

557
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will litter the South with Lannister dead.</font>

558
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.</font>

559
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is he?</font>

560
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.</font>

561
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will be all for tonight.</font>

562
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">A word, Your Grace?</font>

563
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.</font>

564
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not so bad once you get used to it.</font>

565
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.</font>

566
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?</font>

567
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course they are.</font>

568
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,</font>

569
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.</font>

570
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.</font>

571
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.</font>

572
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men who fought my father.</font>

573
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves</font>

574
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.</font>

575
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his only living son.</font>

576
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll listen to me. I know he will.</font>

577
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a Stark. I know that.</font>

578
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.</font>

579
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can avenge him together.</font>

580
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.</font>

581
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need his ships. They say he has 200.</font>

582
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.</font>

583
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we rally them to fight for us?</font>

584
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.</font>

585
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.</font>

586
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.</font>

587
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.</font>

588
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before me, it was Father.</font>

589
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">You married one rebel and mothered another.</font>

590
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mothered more than just rebels,</font>

591
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">a fact you seem to have forgotten.</font>

592
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.</font>

593
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?</font>

594
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Arya...</font>

595
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?</font>

596
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.</font>

597
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for me to go home.</font>

598
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.</font>

599
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't go to Winterfell.</font>

600
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon?</font>

601
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys</font>

602
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.</font>

603
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why in the name of all the gods...</font>

604
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.</font>

605
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's rallied an army of 100,000.</font>

606
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know him. You know his family.</font>

607
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.</font>

608
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a hundred other lords...</font>

609
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?</font>

610
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Renly sides with us,</font>

611
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll outnumber them two to one.</font>

612
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.</font>

613
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get the girls back.</font>

614
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we'll all go home, for good.</font>

615
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will ride at first light.</font>

616
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will all be together again soon, I promise.</font>

617
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done so well.</font>

618
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father would be proud.</font>

619
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.</font>

620
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a king in every corner now.</font>

621
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is all this?</font>

622
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Returning this room to its proper appearance.</font>

623
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.</font>

624
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a seat for a conqueror.</font>

625
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.</font>

626
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't find Arya Stark.</font>

627
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.</font>

628
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps. But if not, we need her.</font>

629
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.</font>

630
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they might. They're weak.</font>

631
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">They put too much value on their women.</font>

632
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.</font>

633
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send out as many men as we can.</font>

634
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...</font>

635
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king does not ask, he commands.</font>

636
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle</font>

637
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.</font>

638
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">His life is in danger.</font>

639
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at war.</font>

640
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">All our lives are in danger.</font>

641
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.</font>

642
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you.</font>

643
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.</font>

644
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a claim. The throne is mine.</font>

645
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it is.</font>

646
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one believes this foul gossip.</font>

647
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone believes it.</font>

648
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father had other children?</font>

649
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?</font>

650
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you asking?</font>

651
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.</font>

652
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many bastards does he have running...</font>

653
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:06,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you just did is punishable by death.</font>

654
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will never do it again.</font>

655
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.</font>

656
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will be all, Mother.</font>

657
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

658
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?</font>

659
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ease into it.</font>

660
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly, with passion.</font>

661
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

662
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.</font>

663
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of you are working tonight.</font>

664
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do things differently here, Daisy.</font>

665
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.</font>

666
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.</font>

667
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our establishment doesn't cater
to plowmen and goat herders.</font>

668
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Olsen.</font>

669
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taste is everything here.</font>

670
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger's a fancy man.</font>

671
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call him Littlefinger.</font>

672
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't like it.</font>

673
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish.</font>

674
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue</font>

675
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that people will think she's exotic.</font>

676
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.</font>

677
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's beautiful.</font>

678
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.</font>

679
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Commander.</font>

680
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you again.</font>

681
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,</font>

682
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">the King's Master of Coin.</font>

683
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coin which goes in many pockets.</font>

684
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Orders.
- Whose orders?</font>

685
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.</font>

686
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't. No! Please!</font>

687
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Not my Barra!</font>

688
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.</font>

689
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill the bastard.
No, no!</font>

690
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Give it here.</font>

691
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please.</font>

692
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spread out. Search every house.</font>

693
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every room. Look in every room.</font>

694
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gendry! His name is Gendry.</font>

695
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the bastard?</font>

696
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch! Please, stop!</font>

697
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

698
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.</font>

699
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.</font>

700
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He made it himself.
- Find him.
