1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta be ready before nightfall.</font>

2
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now keep it moving.</font>

3
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put a watch on the ridge
and the tree lines.</font>

4
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy.</font>

5
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely boy.</font>

6
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

7
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man has a thirst.</font>

8
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man does not drink for a day and a night.</font>

9
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">A boy could make a friend.</font>

10
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have friends.</font>

11
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us beer before I skin you.</font>

12
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man does not choose his companions.</font>

13
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">These two, they have no courtesy.</font>

14
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man must ask forgiveness.</font>

15
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're called Arry?</font>

16
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar,</font>

17
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">once of the Free City of Lorath...</font>

18
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!</font>

19
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have asked nicely.</font>

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

21
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come closer...</font>

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole</font>

23
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fuck you bloody.</font>

24
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">That boy has more courage than sense.</font>

25
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here!</font>

26
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yoren said none of us were
to go near those three.</font>

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here!</font>

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't scare me.</font>

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm? Then you're stupid.</font>

30
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">They scare me.</font>

31
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are gold cloaks
doing so far from King's Landing?</font>

32
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

33
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're looking for me.</font>

34
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">You in command here?</font>

35
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a long way from home.</font>

36
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you a question.</font>

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, you did.</font>

38
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked without manners</font>

39
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I chose not to answer.</font>

40
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a royal warrant</font>

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.</font>

42
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the thing is...</font>

43
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.</font>

44
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">That puts them beyond the reach
of kings and queens.</font>

45
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it?</font>

46
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a funny thing,</font>

47
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">people worry so much about their throats</font>

48
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they forget about what's down low.</font>

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.</font>

50
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.</font>

51
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.</font>

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once it's nicked,</font>

53
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's no one around here
who knows how to un-nick it.</font>

54
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just keep that.</font>

55
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good steel is always needed on the Wall.</font>

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems you have a choice,</font>

57
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,</font>

58
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters</font>

59
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't find what you were looking for.</font>

60
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a boy named Gendry.</font>

61
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">He carries a bull's head helmet.</font>

62
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone turning him over
will earn the King's reward.</font>

63
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be back with more men</font>

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.</font>

65
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make me wait a long time,</font>

67
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your friend keeps me company.</font>

68
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just speaking of your bravery</font>

69
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.</font>

70
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was quite a battle.</font>

71
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.</font>

72
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">The northerners are such fearsome warriors.</font>

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I tell him the story of how we meet.</font>

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens...</font>

75
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">it almost beggars belief.</font>

76
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange things do happen.</font>

77
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should taste her fish pie.</font>

78
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.</font>

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.</font>

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.</font>

81
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll make a fisherman of him yet.</font>

82
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am glad your new friend
was able to accompany you to the capital.</font>

83
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends are such an important part of life.</font>

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.</font>

85
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">But rest easy, my lord.</font>

86
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.</font>

87
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your discretion is legendary...</font>

88
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where your friends are concerned.</font>

89
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.</font>

90
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will leave you.</font>

91
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.</font>

92
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">This city is made brighter by your presence.</font>

93
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a council meeting, my lord.</font>

94
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like threats.</font>

95
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who threatened you?</font>

96
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.</font>

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark was a man of honor.</font>

98
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I am not.</font>

99
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Threaten me again
and I'll have you thrown into the sea.</font>

100
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be disappointed in the results.</font>

101
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Storms come and go,</font>

102
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">the big fish eat the little fish,</font>

103
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I keep on paddling.</font>

104
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, my lord.</font>

105
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.</font>

106
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">"From this time until the end of time,</font>

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">"we are not part of your realm,</font>

108
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">"but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North."</font>

109
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.</font>

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.</font>

111
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can give him his father's bones back,
at least,</font>

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a gesture of good faith.</font>

113
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?</font>

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will, Your Grace.</font>

115
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see my brother
when you were the Starks' guest?</font>

116
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

117
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.</font>

118
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you speak with him,</font>

119
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell him he's not been forgotten.</font>

120
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.</font>

121
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a deft hand with diplomacy.</font>

122
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's everything...</font>

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">A raven flew in this morning
from Castle Black.</font>

124
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trouble with the wildlings.</font>

125
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why they're called "wildlings."</font>

126
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhat less wild these days.</font>

127
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems they've stopped killing each other</font>

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">and started following
this king-beyond-the-Wall.</font>

129
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another king? How many is that now?</font>

130
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five? I've lost count.</font>

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.</font>

132
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.</font>

133
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them."</font>

134
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">The northerners are a superstitious people.</font>

135
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to the Commander,</font>

136
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.</font>

137
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mormont doesn't lie.</font>

138
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you kill a dead man?</font>

139
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently you burn him.</font>

140
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">One trip to the Wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.</font>

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what I believe,</font>

142
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">but here's a fact for you:</font>

143
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Night's Watch is the only thing</font>

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.</font>

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have every confidence that the brave men
of the Night's Watch will protect us all.</font>

146
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said,
"if the gods wanted us to have dignity,</font>

147
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">"they wouldn't make us fart when we died."</font>

148
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">We fart when we die?</font>

149
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">My blessed mother,</font>

150
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was holding her hand
when she left this world.</font>

151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.</font>

152
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.</font>

153
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?</font>

154
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were having a serious discussion.</font>

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you look at that?</font>

156
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.</font>

157
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer watching them come towards me.</font>

158
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that's nice, too.</font>

159
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
on the next farm over from where I grew up.</font>

160
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old.</font>

161
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we got older and the wrestling...</font>

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">changed.</font>

163
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were with her?</font>

164
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times?</font>

165
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, as many times as I could.</font>

166
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I grew up on a farm.</font>

167
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.</font>

168
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the turnips, too.</font>

169
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Ghost, no.</font>

170
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

171
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!</font>

172
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

173
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.</font>

174
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

175
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right.</font>

176
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

177
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.</font>

178
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very brave.</font>

179
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

180
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Gilly.</font>

181
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's one of Craster's daughters.</font>

182
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?</font>

183
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam said you could help.</font>

184
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed...</font>

185
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's pregnant.</font>

186
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to take her with us when we leave.</font>

187
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

188
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What would that...
- I know it sounds a bit mad.</font>

189
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.</font>

190
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Lord Commander ordered us to...
- We are sworn to protect.</font>

191
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sam, we can't take...
- Please, sir, please.</font>

192
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can still run if I have to.</font>

193
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.</font>

194
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's a boy...</font>

195
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it's a boy, what?</font>

196
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want us to risk our lives for you
and you won't even tell us why?</font>

197
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?</font>

198
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were cruel.
- Cruel?</font>

199
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?</font>

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.</font>

201
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think Craster cuts off for that?</font>

202
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat.</font>

203
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're heading
deeper and deeper into wildling territory.</font>

204
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.</font>

205
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if he would,
what would we do with her?</font>

206
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's going to deliver a baby, you?</font>

207
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could try.</font>

208
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I've read about it.</font>

209
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit.</font>

210
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Sam.</font>

211
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't help her.</font>

212
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi.</font>

213
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.</font>

214
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.</font>

215
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Jhaqo.</font>

216
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a khalasar.</font>

217
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will like it far less
when I am done with them.</font>

218
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">They killed his soul!</font>

219
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh. They cannot kill his soul.</font>

220
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did!</font>

221
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">They butchered him like an animal.</font>

222
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did not burn his body.</font>

223
00:16:55,723 --> 00:17:00,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can neverjoin his ancestors
in the night lands.</font>

224
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.</font>

225
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I promise you,</font>

226
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.</font>

227
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it as you remember, my lord?</font>

228
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks smaller.</font>

229
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything looks bigger when you're a child.</font>

230
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.</font>

231
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now look at it.</font>

232
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be waiting for me on the docks.</font>

233
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who will?</font>

234
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone who matters.</font>

235
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a big day for them.</font>

236
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.</font>

237
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a hard place, the Iron islands.</font>

238
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always has been.</font>

239
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold and it's wet.</font>

240
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love the cold and wet.</font>

241
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say hard places breed hard men.</font>

242
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hard men rule the world.</font>

243
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll be king before long.</font>

244
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try smiling with your lips closed.</font>

245
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better.</font>

246
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.</font>

247
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't blame him.</font>

248
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says that you're all reavers and rapers</font>

249
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that no matter
how many women you have,</font>

250
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll never be sat...</font>

251
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quit talking about your father.</font>

252
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's right about us.</font>

253
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our wives from the Iron islands,
they're for breeding.</font>

254
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not enough for us.</font>

255
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we take salt wives,
the women we capture.</font>

256
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capture me.</font>

257
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me with you when you go ashore.</font>

258
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.</font>

259
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after you leave.</font>

260
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.</font>

261
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't paid you.</font>

262
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

263
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid good money...</font>

264
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to stand for this.</font>

265
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I barely touched her.</font>

266
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel</font>

267
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is what I get, crying.</font>

268
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">One moment, my friend. A moment.</font>

269
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please accept my sincerest apologies.</font>

270
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aremca will take good care of you.</font>

271
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, my lord.</font>

272
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he hurt you?</font>

273
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord.</font>

274
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Mhaegen.</font>

275
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

276
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">She works for you.</font>

277
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the one...</font>

278
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gold cloaks,</font>

279
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.</font>

280
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was...</font>

281
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">poorly handled.</font>

282
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.</font>

283
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stop thinking about it.</font>

284
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep.</font>

285
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her poor little baby.</font>

286
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you remind me of another girl,</font>

287
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lovely thing I once acquired
from a Lysene pleasure house.</font>

288
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beautiful, like yourself,</font>

289
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">and intelligent, like yourself.</font>

290
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she wasn't happy.</font>

291
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">She cried often.</font>

292
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked her why,</font>

293
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.</font>

294
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it was quite sad.</font>

295
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
are expensive,</font>

296
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">extremely expensive.</font>

297
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this one wasn't making me any money.</font>

298
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate bad investments.</font>

299
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, I do.</font>

300
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">They haunt me.</font>

301
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had no idea how to make her happy,</font>

302
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">no idea how to mitigate my losses.</font>

303
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money</font>

304
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">to let him transform</font>

305
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">this lovely, sad girl.</font>

306
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">To use her in ways</font>

307
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">that would never occur to most men.</font>

308
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what occurs to most men.</font>

309
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,</font>

310
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my losses were definitely mitigated.</font>

311
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.</font>

312
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

313
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll be happy?</font>

314
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes me happy.</font>

315
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">More wine?</font>

316
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.</font>

317
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us, Podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.</font>

318
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your new squire?</font>

319
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could've found you a proper lad.</font>

320
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myself, I prefer the improper ones.</font>

321
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good red. Dornish?</font>

322
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know your wines, my lord.</font>

323
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I do.</font>

324
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fine dinner, my lord.</font>

325
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me Tyrion, please.</font>

326
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
now that you're a lord.</font>

327
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.</font>

328
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wars have been started for less.</font>

329
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.</font>

330
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

331
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nasty business.</font>

332
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.</font>

333
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The City Watch must keep the peace.</font>

334
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only, I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.</font>

335
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.</font>

336
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially the Queen's orders.</font>

337
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said they were the Queen's orders.</font>

338
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?</font>

339
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's always been a jealous woman.</font>

340
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know your sister better than I do.</font>

341
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?</font>

342
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't listen to filth.</font>

343
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good of you, but you have heard them.</font>

344
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards</font>

345
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.</font>

346
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.</font>

347
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate your loyalty.</font>

348
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men</font>

349
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the throne room, did you give the order?</font>

350
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

351
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I would again.</font>

352
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man was a traitor.</font>

353
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to buy my loyalty.</font>

354
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fool.</font>

355
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had no idea you were already bought.</font>

356
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you drunk?</font>

357
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp!</font>

358
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.</font>

359
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm denying its existence.</font>

360
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf...</font>

361
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.</font>

362
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,</font>

363
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.</font>

364
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I intend to serve as Hand of the King</font>

365
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">until my father returns from the war.</font>

366
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,</font>

367
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.</font>

368
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you...</font>

369
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends at court will not allow this!</font>

370
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Queen herself has granted...
- The Queen Regent.</font>

371
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.</font>

372
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.</font>

373
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we shan't.</font>

374
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.</font>

375
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">From there, I'm afraid,
it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.</font>

376
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you enjoy the Wall.</font>

377
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it surprisingly beautiful...</font>

378
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.</font>

379
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lads will escort you.</font>

380
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.</font>

381
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men are under my command!</font>

382
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">I command you to arrest this cutthroat.</font>

383
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Bronn,</font>

384
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he is the new commander
of the City Watch.</font>

385
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys.</font>

386
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have friends at court,</font>

387
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">powerful friends!</font>

388
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king himself made me a lord!</font>

389
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the new commander.</font>

390
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,</font>

391
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">still at her mother's breast,</font>

392
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you do it without question?</font>

393
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without question? No.</font>

394
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd ask, "How much?"</font>

395
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they come back, I say we yield.</font>

396
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gendry's the one they want.</font>

397
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.</font>

398
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't afraid of no battles.</font>

399
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.</font>

400
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen lots of battles.</font>

401
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw...
- Liar.</font>

402
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a man kill another man</font>

403
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.</font>

404
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stabbed him right in the neck.</font>

405
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two men fighting isn't a battle.</font>

406
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They had armor on.
- So?</font>

407
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.</font>

408
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it isn't.</font>

409
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?</font>

410
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.</font>

411
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot Pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.</font>

412
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's when they've got armor on.</font>

413
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who told you that?</font>

414
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">A knight.</font>

415
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you know he was a knight?</font>

416
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.</font>

417
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to be a knight to have armor.</font>

418
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any idiot can buy armor.</font>

419
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

420
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I sold armor.</font>

421
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do the gold cloaks want with you?</font>

422
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No idea.
- You're a liar.</font>

423
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you shouldn't
insult people that are bigger than you.</font>

424
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.</font>

425
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what any of them want.</font>

426
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">No good's ever come of their questions.</font>

427
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">No good's ever come?</font>

428
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who asked questions before?</font>

429
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?</font>

430
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who asked questions?</font>

431
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hand of the King.</font>

432
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands of the King.</font>

433
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,</font>

434
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.</font>

435
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark?</font>

436
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? Asking me questions is bad luck.</font>

437
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll probably be dead soon.</font>

438
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did they ask about?
- My mum.</font>

439
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's your mum?
- Just my mum,</font>

440
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">worked in a tavern, died when I was little.</font>

441
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who was your father?</font>

442
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.</font>

443
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you anyway?</font>

444
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought they were after you.</font>

445
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

446
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?</font>

447
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.</font>

448
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?</font>

449
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupider.</font>

450
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.</font>

451
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!</font>

452
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.</font>

453
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to take a piss.</font>

454
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.</font>

455
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can know.</font>

456
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they won't. Not from me.</font>

457
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name's not Arry.</font>

458
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Arya, of House Stark.</font>

459
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.</font>

460
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.</font>

461
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was never a traitor.</font>

462
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey is a liar.</font>

463
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.</font>

464
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I mean, yes.</font>

465
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother was a lady and my sister...</font>

466
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...</font>

467
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...</font>

468
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.</font>

469
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be calling you "my lady."</font>

470
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.</font>

471
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was unladylike.</font>

472
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

473
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's she carrying?</font>

474
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrish oranges,</font>

475
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">wine from the Arbor...</font>

476
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the heir to Pyke and the Iron islands.</font>

477
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.</font>

478
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

479
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like wine.</font>

480
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woman's drink.</font>

481
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get to Pyke.</font>

482
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find you a horse.</font>

483
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm heading that way. I can take you there.</font>

484
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you can.</font>

485
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been at sea long?</font>

486
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or were there just no women
where you came from?</font>

487
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.</font>

488
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you don't know what you're like.</font>

489
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you need someone to teach you.</font>

490
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who I am?</font>

491
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,</font>

492
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Greyjoy?</font>

493
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have my things sent up to the castle.</font>

494
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should give me the reins.</font>

495
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a better rider than you.</font>

496
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.</font>

497
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine years?</font>

498
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you still know your way around a ship?</font>

499
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have these hands ever touched a rope?</font>

500
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you worry about my hands.</font>

501
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sea is in my blood.</font>

502
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.</font>

503
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a proposal for my father,</font>

504
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">one that will make him king again,</font>

505
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">and me after him.</font>

506
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.</font>

507
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that an offer from my future king?</font>

508
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">An order from your future king.</font>

509
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.</font>

510
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.</font>

511
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

512
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine years, is it?</font>

513
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took a frightened boy.</font>

514
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have they given back?</font>

515
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man.</font>

516
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.</font>

517
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark had you longer than I did.</font>

518
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark is gone.</font>

519
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do you feel about that?</font>

520
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's done is done.</font>

521
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.</font>

522
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gave you those clothes?</font>

523
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?</font>

524
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my clothes offend you, I will change them.</font>

525
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will.</font>

526
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">That bauble round your neck,</font>

527
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?</font>

528
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked a question.</font>

529
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made</font>

530
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?</font>

531
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Iron or gold?</font>

532
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gold.</font>

533
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.</font>

534
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">My fears have come true,</font>

535
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Starks have made you theirs.</font>

536
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me</font>

537
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a trained raven clutching his message.</font>

538
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">The offer he makes is one I proposed.</font>

539
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,</font>

540
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">hunted with him, fought at his side.</font>

541
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks of me as a brother.</font>

542
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not here, not in my hearing.</font>

543
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not name him brother,</font>

544
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.</font>

545
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or have you forgotten your own blood?</font>

546
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forget nothing.</font>

547
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember my brothers.</font>

548
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I remember when my father was a king.</font>

549
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:27,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

550
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him</font>

551
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he will make me
king of the Iron islands once again.</font>

552
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?</font>

553
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your son, your only living heir.</font>

554
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else?</font>

555
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to wait outside.</font>

556
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get past the guards?</font>

557
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything with a cock is easy to fool.</font>

558
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear.</font>

559
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yara?</font>

560
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">So good to see you, brother.</font>

561
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.</font>

562
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She can't lead an attack!
- And why not?</font>

563
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a woman!</font>

564
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.</font>

565
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship</font>

566
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">after your new father killed him.</font>

567
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's dead may never die.
- ... dead may never die.</font>

568
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only nights she's spent off these islands
have been spent on the sea.</font>

569
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's commanded men.</font>

570
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's killed men.</font>

571
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows who she is.</font>

572
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">No man gives me a crown.</font>

573
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pay the iron price.</font>

574
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take my crown,</font>

575
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">for that is who I am.</font>

576
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is who we have always been.</font>

577
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.</font>

578
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who said anything about the Lannisters?</font>

579
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.</font>

580
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these kings fighting for the throne,</font>

581
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this Stannis has the smallest army.</font>

582
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?</font>

583
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're a smart gambler.</font>

584
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis has proved himself in war twice.</font>

585
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.</font>

586
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither has the false King Joffrey.</font>

587
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet they both have larger armies.</font>

588
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis has just begun the fight.</font>

589
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">His bannermen will rally to his cause.</font>

590
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:45,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon</font>

591
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">or more worthy of loyalty.</font>

592
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the world coming to</font>

593
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?</font>

594
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.</font>

595
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm insulted?</font>

596
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.</font>

597
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't sail for promises.</font>

598
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you do.</font>

599
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise,</font>

600
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">a promise that somewhere on the sea,</font>

601

<font color="#FFFFFF">somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.</font>

00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.</font>

603
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a young man, Salladhor.</font>

604
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.</font>

605
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the clever ones.</font>

606
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to spend
your last few years on the sea</font>

607
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.</font>

608
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.</font>

609
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I'm offering you is hard.</font>

610
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.</font>

611
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.</font>

612
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.</font>

613
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.</font>

614
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.</font>

615
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.</font>

616
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.</font>

617
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,</font>

618
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.</font>

619
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war isn't about you.</font>

620
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.</font>

621
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.</font>

622
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if she would just let you.</font>

623
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know how persuasive I am.</font>

624
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never tried to fuck you.</font>

625
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,</font>

626
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one true god...</font>

627
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been all over the world, my boy,</font>

628
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.</font>

629
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all think they found the right one.</font>

630
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,</font>

631
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">and better yet, a queen's legs.</font>

632
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.</font>

633
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's young yet.</font>

634
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.</font>

635
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot promise you the queen.</font>

636
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">You believe your king can win?</font>

637
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is the one true king.</font>

638
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Westerosi are funny people.</font>

639
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.</font>

640
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.</font>

641
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.</font>

642
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me rich.</font>

643
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.</font>

644
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will the king have us sail?</font>

645
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as his god wills it.</font>

646
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's my god, too, and yours,</font>

647
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you are too blind to see.</font>

648
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.</font>

649
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't take long.
You already know the letters.</font>

650
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.</font>

651
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had a god, truly.</font>

652
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every god there is,</font>

653
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.</font>

654
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- None of it works.
- But you always came home.</font>

655
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't praying.</font>

656
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was.</font>

657
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every night that you were at sea,</font>

658
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lit a candle and I prayed for you.</font>

659
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to have a god?</font>

660
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. King Stannis is my god.</font>

661
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.</font>

662
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.</font>

663
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.</font>

664
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think a fire god commanded all that?</font>

665
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Stannis, only Stannis.</font>

666
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.</font>

667
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell him that.</font>

668
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Janos Slynt
was commander of the City Watch.</font>

669
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had no right to exile him.</font>

670
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have every right. I am the King's Hand.</font>

671
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.</font>

672
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Queen Regent.</font>

673
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, Queen Regent.</font>

674
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're losing the people.</font>

675
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you hear me?
- The people.</font>

676
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I care?</font>

677
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.</font>

678
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.</font>

679
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,</font>

680
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Queen slaughters babies."</font>

681
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even have the decency to deny it.</font>

682
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?</font>

683
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey didn't even tell you.</font>

684
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he tell you?</font>

685
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine that would be even worse.</font>

686
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did what needed to be done.</font>

687
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?</font>

688
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,</font>

689
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">ripping them out by the root, one by one,</font>

690
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they strangle you in your sleep.</font>

691
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no king,
but I think there's more to ruling than that.</font>

692
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what you think!</font>

693
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never taken it seriously.</font>

694
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't, Jaime hasn't.</font>

695
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all fallen on me.</font>

696
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.</font>

697
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're funny.</font>

698
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've always been funny...</font>

699
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">but none of yourjokes will ever match
the first one, will they?</font>

700
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember?</font>

701
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her</font>

702
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she bled to death?</font>

703
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was my mother, too.</font>

704
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother gone...</font>

705
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the sake of you.</font>

706
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.</font>

707
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.</font>

708
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you fare with your pirate?</font>

709
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.</font>

710
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">His men know how to fight.</font>

711
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.</font>

712
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">It does seem the wiser choice.</font>

713
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't be a choice this time.</font>

714
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you trust him?</font>

715
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.</font>

716
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never trusted him.</font>

717
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.</font>

718
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.</font>

719
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us.</font>

720
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">At once, Your Grace.</font>

721
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.</font>

722
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

723
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say to him?</font>

724
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him death by fire is the purest death.</font>

725
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Because it is true.</font>

726
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're troubled, my king.</font>

727
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

728
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.</font>

729
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your lord to burn them, then.</font>

730
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell him nothing.</font>

731
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray for his commands and I obey.</font>

732
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,</font>

733
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.</font>

734
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have faith.</font>

735
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faith?</font>

736
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,</font>

737
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">nine times out of ten.</font>

738
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we must be the 10th.</font>

739
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot defeat my brother in the field.</font>

740
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.</font>

741
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen the path to victory in the flames.</font>

742
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.</font>

743
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've said the words, damn you.</font>

744
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I burned the idols.</font>

745
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must give all of yourself.</font>

746
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a wife.</font>

747
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
