1
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've taken your castle.</font>

2
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.</font>

3
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up. You have to get dressed.</font>

4
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've taken Winterfell.</font>

5
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it. I'm occupying it.</font>

6
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.</font>

7
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- To take the castle.</font>

8
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.</font>

9
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Greyjoy.
I can't fight for Robb and my father both.</font>

10
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.</font>

11
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find the halfwit.</font>

12
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.</font>

13
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- So you and I can go down and tell them</font>

14
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.</font>

15
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you will.</font>

16
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't. I'll never yield.</font>

17
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll fight you and throw you out.</font>

18
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">The castle is mine.</font>

19
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">But these people are still yours.</font>

20
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll yield to keep them safe,</font>

21
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep them alive.</font>

22
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what a good lord would do.</font>

23
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think carefully about what you want to say.</font>

24
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon.</font>

25
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hate us the whole time?</font>

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.</font>

27
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Louder.</font>

28
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say Prince Theon.</font>

29
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.</font>

30
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all know me.</font>

31
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.</font>

32
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farlen, you be silent.</font>

33
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to your little lord, Farlen.</font>

34
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has more sense than you do.</font>

35
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you should do as he commands.</font>

36
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father has donned
the ancient crown of Salt and Rock</font>

37
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.</font>

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.</font>

39
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are all his subjects.
- Bugger that.</font>

40
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve the Starks.</font>

41
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you think you can hold the North with it...
- Shut up!</font>

42
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,</font>

43
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will be as good to you as he ever was.
- Steady.</font>

44
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.</font>

45
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke</font>

46
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">informing my father of my victory here.</font>

47
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.</font>

48
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.</font>

49
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a maester of the Citadel,</font>

50
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell,
are you not?</font>

51
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the Lord of Winterfell
as Bran just informed you.</font>

53
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send the ravens.</font>

54
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord Greyjoy.</font>

56
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.</font>

57
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

58
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was brought here a captive.</font>

59
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were here the day I was taken.</font>

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one who took you. What of it?</font>

61
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me serve you.</font>

62
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Serve me how?</font>

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.</font>

64
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.</font>

65
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put a spear in my hand again.</font>

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can bury it in my neck?
Do you take me for a fool?</font>

67
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

68
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside.</font>

69
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your dream, little lord.</font>

71
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ocean has come to swallow this place.</font>

72
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't letting it drown me.</font>

73
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll all go about
your tasks as usual.</font>

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And in a few days' time...
Greyjoy!</font>

75
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">We caught this one on his way back
from Torrhen's Square.</font>

76
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took out two of ours before I got his sword.</font>

77
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.</font>

78
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.</font>

79
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were raised here under this roof.</font>

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.</font>

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robb thought of you as a brother.</font>

82
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brothers are dead.</font>

83
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">They died fighting Stark men, men like you.</font>

84
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, they died fighting a war
your father started.</font>

85
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.</font>

86
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Among them, but not one of them.</font>

87
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was his hostage, taken from my home.</font>

88
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he were alive to see this...</font>

89
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not. He's dead.</font>

90
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seven Kingdoms are at war.</font>

91
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Winterfell is mine.</font>

92
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have put a sword in your belly
instead of in your hand.</font>

93
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've served this house faithfully, old man.</font>

94
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">But keep talking and I'll...</font>

95
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him to the cells. Lock him up...</font>

96
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">My prince.</font>

97
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot let that stand. He must pay.</font>

98
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.</font>

99
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he has to pay the iron price.</font>

100
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll never respect you while he lives.</font>

101
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Rodrik,</font>

102
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sentence you to death!</font>

103
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.</font>

104
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.</font>

105
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I urge you not to make a hasty decision.</font>

106
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">He disrespected me
in front of my men.</font>

107
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was his decision, not mine.</font>

108
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is worth more to you alive than dead.</font>

109
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks will pay.</font>

110
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Theon, think what you do.</font>

111
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll address me as Prince Theon
or you'll be next.</font>

112
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

113
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

114
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
Theon!</font>

115
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rodrik!</font>

116
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.</font>

117
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm begging you.
Coward.</font>

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

119
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Stop right now!</font>

120
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't give commands anymore, little lord.</font>

121
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
Hush now, child.</font>

122
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm off to see your father.</font>

123
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said no harm would come!</font>

124
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said no harm would come. Theon, please.</font>

125
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any last words, old man?</font>

126
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.</font>

127
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you are truly lost.</font>

128
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon, please don't. Do something!</font>

129
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do anything, please!</font>

130
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please stop it!</font>

131
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost, stay with us.</font>

132
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost!</font>

133
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">There goes your pet.</font>

134
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a pet.</font>

135
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're right, he's not.</font>

136
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tame a wild thing.</font>

137
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't trust a wild thing.</font>

138
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ghost is different.
- So you think.</font>

139
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wild creatures have their own rules,</font>

140
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">their own reasons.</font>

141
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll never know them.</font>

142
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the wildlings we're looking for</font>

143
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">sleep during the day and hunt at night.</font>

144
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.</font>

145
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said you can't.</font>

146
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">They find a nice cave to hide in
while the sun's up</font>

147
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">and do their killing when it's dark.</font>

148
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could do the same.</font>

149
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we couldn't.</font>

150
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is their country.</font>

151
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know where to walk, where not to walk.</font>

152
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
they didn't see till they were in it.</font>

153
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father always said I'm of the North.</font>

154
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.</font>

155
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">This look like home to you?</font>

156
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.</font>

157
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand me?</font>

158
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.</font>

159
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at war.</font>

160
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've always been at war.</font>

161
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.</font>

162
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.</font>

163
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Watch has given you a great gift.</font>

164
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only have one thing to give in return,</font>

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">your life.</font>

166
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.</font>

167
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.</font>

168
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">And know this, boy.</font>

169
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.</font>

170
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll never know what you've done.</font>

171
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.</font>

172
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard</font>

173
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.</font>

174
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, do you understand me?</font>

175
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

176
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're even dumber than you look.</font>

177
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just words, boy,</font>

178
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep us a little warmer in the night.</font>

179
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make us feel like we've got a purpose.</font>

180
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

181
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.</font>

182
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you read?
- My lord?</font>

183
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you read?</font>

184
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">This letter detailing our infantry movements</font>

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.</font>

186
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.</font>

187
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">My apologies, my lord. I must have...</font>

188
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl, fetch me the History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses.</font>

189
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the one on this...</font>

190
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cupbearer can read better than you.</font>

191
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?</font>

192
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, I...</font>

193
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the Starks of Winterfell!</font>

194
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who have 20,000 men and my son!</font>

195
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I judged you might be good for something
more than brutalizing peasants.</font>

196
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see I overestimated you.</font>

197
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...</font>

198
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us.</font>

199
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the book away, girl.</font>

200
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should devise our next battle plan
while you're about it.</font>

201
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Petyr Baelish.</font>

202
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

203
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us the room.</font>

204
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear all this.</font>

205
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.</font>

206
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wine?
- Thank you.</font>

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What news from the capital?</font>

208
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I traveled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.</font>

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the late King Renly.</font>

210
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rather a short reign.</font>

211
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murdered by a woman, I hear.</font>

212
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they say.</font>

213
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has been talk of other forces at work.</font>

214
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark forces.</font>

215
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

216
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.</font>

217
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.</font>

218
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.</font>

219
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.</font>

220
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?</font>

221
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.</font>

222
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,</font>

223
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.</font>

224
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.</font>

225
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.</font>

226
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Margaery...</font>

227
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wants to be queen.</font>

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she does.</font>

229
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.</font>

230
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Against my grandson.
- They did.</font>

231
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And perhaps that treason should be punished</font>

232
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">one day,</font>

233
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.</font>

234
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">More wine for Lord Baelish.</font>

235
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you will allow me to
represent your family's interests,</font>

236
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that an advantageous agreement...</font>

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?</font>

238
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have.</font>

239
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon, my lord.</font>

240
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only wine.</font>

241
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would ride there yourself?</font>

242
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, with your leave.</font>

243
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have an answer by nightfall.</font>

244
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll be all, girl.</font>

245
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what else?</font>

246
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your son Tyrion's directive,</font>

247
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met with Catelyn Stark.</font>

248
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

249
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.</font>

250
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

251
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A girl.
- A wildling.</font>

252
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could question her.</font>

253
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could.</font>

254
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't answer.</font>

255
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue
instead of talking.</font>

256
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Ygritte.</font>

257
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was reaching for this ax
when you got to her.</font>

258
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.</font>

259
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you my name.</font>

260
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jon Snow.</font>

261
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ought to burn them you killed.</font>

262
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd need a big fire for that.</font>

263
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Ygritte.</font>

264
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you want us to build a big fire?</font>

265
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are there some more friends in the area?</font>

266
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn them or maybe
you'll need those swords again.</font>

267
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our boy here's already killed one dead man.</font>

268
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can do it again if he has to.</font>

269
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">What waits beyond the pass?</font>

270
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The free folk.
- How many?</font>

271
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hundreds and thousands.</font>

272
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than you've ever seen, crow.</font>

273
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why come to the mountains?</font>

274
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?</font>

275
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mean to march on the Wall?</font>

276
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who I am, girl?</font>

277
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Qhorin Halfhand.</font>

278
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me true.</font>

279
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your people captured me,</font>

280
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">would they take me prisoner?</font>

281
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.</font>

282
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, they'd kill you slow.</font>

283
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no food for her.</font>

284
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't spare a man to watch her.</font>

285
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't let her go.
She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.</font>

286
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
No.</font>

287
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'll do it.</font>

288
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, brothers.</font>

289
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll leave him to it.</font>

290
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll meet you at the top.</font>

291
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take too long.</font>

292
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're deep in their country now.</font>

293
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never killed a woman before, did you?</font>

294
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to do it.</font>

295
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance would take you. I know he would.</font>

296
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's secret ways.</font>

297
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crows would never catch us.</font>

298
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm as much a crow as they are.</font>

299
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you burn me?</font>

300
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">After?</font>

301
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't.</font>

302
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone might see the smoke.</font>

303
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike hard and true,</font>

304
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon Snow,</font>

305
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll come back and haunt you.</font>

306
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cold.</font>

307
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

308
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be quick about it.</font>

309
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

310
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard, do it!</font>

311
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do it. We both know it.</font>

312
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sun's going down, Jon Snow.</font>

313
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your friends are nowhere close.</font>

314
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find them.</font>

315
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call for them. Go on.</font>

316
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call loudly.</font>

317
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Seven guide the princess
on herjourney.</font>

318
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Mother give her health.</font>

319
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the crone give her wisdom.</font>

320
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the warrior give her courage.</font>

321
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day I pray you love someone.</font>

322
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray you love her so much,</font>

323
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you close your eyes, you see her face.</font>

324
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want that for you.</font>

325
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,</font>

326
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">to truly love someone.</font>

327
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I take her from you.</font>

328
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like a little cat
mewling for his mother.</font>

329
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princes don't cry.</font>

330
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, my lady?</font>

331
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.</font>

332
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

333
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems a normal thing.</font>

334
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your little brother a prince?</font>

335
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

336
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really relevant then, is it?</font>

337
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, dog.</font>

338
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail Joffrey!</font>

339
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail to the King.</font>

340
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.</font>

341
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murderer! Bastard!</font>

342
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">All hail the King.</font>

343
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's no king. He's a bastard!</font>

344
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.</font>

345
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freak.</font>

346
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the Prince back to the Keep now.</font>

347
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.</font>

348
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Your Grace,
give us some food!</font>

349
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bread, Your Grace, please!</font>

350
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who threw that?</font>

351
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the man who threw that.</font>

352
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find who did that and bring him to me!</font>

353
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!
Hold them back!</font>

354
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kill them! Kill them all!</font>

355
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Move. Move!
Pull back!</font>

356
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tear him to pieces!</font>

357
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
I want these people executed!</font>

358
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they want the same for you.</font>

359
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Sansa?</font>

360
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Through the door.
Come on.</font>

361
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Push hard.</font>

362
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protect the king!</font>

363
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get back!
- Fall back!</font>

364
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep him safe!</font>

365
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brotherfucker!</font>

366
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Watch out.
- Hold them back.</font>

367
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

368
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitors!</font>

369
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll have all their heads.
- You blind, bloody fool.</font>

370
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't insult me.</font>

371
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,</font>

372
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't know if we've ever been
cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.</font>

373
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't...
- I can, I am.</font>

374
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">They attacked me!</font>

375
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?</font>

376
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're starving, you fool.</font>

377
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">All because of a war you started.</font>

378
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking to a king!</font>

379
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I've struck a king.</font>

380
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did my hand fall from my wrist?</font>

381
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the Stark girl?</font>

382
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them have her.</font>

383
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.</font>

384
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You owe him quite a bit, you know.</font>

385
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

386
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever been fucked, little girl?</font>

387
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

388
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.</font>

389
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take my orders from the king.</font>

390
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?
This way.</font>

391
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

392
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

393
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

394
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.</font>

395
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get you. We'll get you.</font>

396
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

397
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you hurt, my lady?</font>

398
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little bird's bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.</font>

399
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See to that cut.
- Well done, Clegane.</font>

400
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do it for you.</font>

401
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shouldn't make me wait.</font>

402
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Spice King is
the second wealthiest man in Qarth.</font>

403
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">He makes everyone wait.</font>

404
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment</font>

405
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.</font>

406
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already have a husband.</font>

407
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.</font>

408
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are far too young to be a widow forever</font>

409
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">and far too beautiful.</font>

410
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:14,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are far too smart
to think that I will succumb to flattery.</font>

411
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have traveled very far in my life</font>

412
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">and met many women,</font>

413
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">but none that are immune to flattery.</font>

414
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mother of Dragons!</font>

415
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he comes.</font>

416
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.</font>

417
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible dreams.</font>

418
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could not sleep until the sun was shining</font>

419
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the birds were singing.</font>

420
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what a beauty you are</font>

421
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">now the Red Waste has been washed off you.</font>

422
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.</font>

423
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">The silver hair of a true Targaryen.</font>

424
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xaro Xhoan Daxos,</font>

425
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">she is far too lovely for
a glorified dockworker like yourself.</font>

426
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,</font>

427
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,</font>

428
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.</font>

429
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every lady alive was lovelier</font>

430
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">and higher born than my grandfather.</font>

431
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?</font>

432
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have them flogged in the square.</font>

433
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,</font>

434
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.</font>

435
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.</font>

436
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, my little princess, what is it you want?</font>

437
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">My birthright.</font>

438
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.</font>

439
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear I'm no better
than a servant in this regard.</font>

440
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot give you what I do not have.</font>

441
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.</font>

442
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking you for ships.</font>

443
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to cross the Narrow Sea.</font>

444
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need my ships as well.</font>

445
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.</font>

446
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you grant me now will be repaid</font>

447
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">three times over
when I retake the Iron Throne.</font>

448
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Retake?</font>

449
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?</font>

450
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father sat there, before he was murdered.</font>

451
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you did not sit on it yourself,</font>

452
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">would it not be correct
to say "take the Iron Throne"?</font>

453
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't come here to argue grammar.</font>

454
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not. You came to take my ships.</font>

455
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let me explain my position, little princess.</font>

456
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.</font>

457
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make my living by trade.</font>

458
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I judge every trade on its merits.</font>

459
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask for ships.</font>

460
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say I shall be repaid triple.</font>

461
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.</font>

462
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">But before you repay your debts,</font>

463
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

464
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.</font>

465
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not have an army.</font>

466
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?</font>

467
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are many there that support my claim.</font>

468
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">When were you there last?</font>

469
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left when I was a baby.</font>

470
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, in truth, you have no allies.</font>

471
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when I return.</font>

472
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

473
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, little princess,</font>

474
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.</font>

475
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you'll pardon me.</font>

476
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know lllyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?</font>

477
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.</font>

478
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.</font>

479
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:19,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.</font>

480
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?</font>

481
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs</font>

482
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a great fire, they would hatch.</font>

483
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.</font>

484
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when the fire burned out,</font>

485
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was unhurt,</font>

486
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Mother of Dragons.</font>

487
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

488
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no ordinary woman.</font>

489
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dreams come true.</font>

490
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire your passion.</font>

491
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.</font>

492
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, little princess.</font>

493
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not your little princess.</font>

494
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,</font>

495
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will take what is mine.</font>

496
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">With fire and blood, I will take it.</font>

497
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.</font>

498
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who taught you to read?</font>

499
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father, my lord.</font>

500
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

501
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I taught my son Jaime to read.</font>

502
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.</font>

503
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">He couldn't make sense of the letters.</font>

504
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">He reversed them in his head.</font>

505
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction</font>

506
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that we simply must accept it.</font>

507
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

508
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:14,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.</font>

509
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hated me for it, for a time.</font>

510
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a long time.</font>

511
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he learned.</font>

512
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

513
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your father? Is he alive?</font>

514
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was he?</font>

515
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stonemason.</font>

516
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stonemason who could read?</font>

517
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

518
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He taught himself.</font>

519
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a man.</font>

520
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">What killed him?</font>

521
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loyalty.</font>

522
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?</font>

523
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did...</font>

524
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.</font>

525
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

526
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've already begun.</font>

527
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know your father, my lord?</font>

528
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

529
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grew up with him.</font>

530
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched him grow old.</font>

531
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved us.</font>

532
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good man,</font>

533
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a weak man.</font>

534
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">A weak man who nearly destroyed
our house and name.</font>

535
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cold.</font>

536
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.</font>

537
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

538
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going, girl?</font>

539
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">The armory, my lord.</font>

540
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Lord Tywin sent me.</font>

541
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">What might this be?</font>

542
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Tywin gave it to me.</font>

543
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">What for?</font>

544
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">To take to the armory.</font>

545
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he do that?</font>

546
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go and ask him.</font>

547
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

548
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the way!</font>

549
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amory Lorch.</font>

550
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl has named a second name.</font>

551
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man will do what must be done.</font>

552
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

553
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl cannot tell a man
when exactly he must do a thing.</font>

554
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.</font>

555
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.</font>

556
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has to be now.</font>

557
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guard!</font>

558
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.</font>

559
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">My honor, Your Grace.</font>

560
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

561
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- Quent.</font>

562
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Talisa.</font>

563
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

564
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure I'm a lady.</font>

565
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.</font>

566
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to keep all the rules straight.</font>

567
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I remember my lessons,</font>

568
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.</font>

569
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless she's a queen or a princess.</font>

570
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could find someone who knows.</font>

571
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?</font>

572
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's obvious.</font>

573
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I told you my father
sold lace on the Long Bridge,</font>

574
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my mother, my brother and I
lived with him above our shop?</font>

575
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd call you a liar.</font>

576
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.</font>

577
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always thought I was a brilliant liar.</font>

578
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better at amputations, I'm afraid.</font>

579
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a pretty spot.</font>

580
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will we be here long?</font>

581
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.</font>

582
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a spy.</font>

583
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.</font>

584
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. You've found me out.</font>

585
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
"The young wolf is on the move. "</font>

586
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'd join me.</font>

587
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you've got time, of course, for, well...</font>

588
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb.</font>

589
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother.</font>

590
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother, this is Lady Talisa.</font>

591
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been helping with the wounded.</font>

592
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been very helpful.</font>

593
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lady Talisa.
- Lady Stark.</font>

594
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Talisa...</font>

595
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?</font>

596
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, I do not know this name.</font>

597
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.</font>

598
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.</font>

599
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've missed you.</font>

600
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you look positively forlorn.</font>

601
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You surprised me, that's all.</font>

602
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think I'd see you today.</font>

603
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish that you were free to follow your heart.</font>

604
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

605
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.</font>

606
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid they come at a cost.</font>

607
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are promised to another.
- I know.</font>

608
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">A debt that must be paid.</font>

609
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace. My lady.</font>

610
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">News from Winterfell.</font>

611
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brothers desert you?</font>

612
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you which way to go.</font>

613
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll stop here.</font>

614
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too dark to go any farther today.</font>

615
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here? There's no shelter here.</font>

616
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no shelter anywhere.</font>

617
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is...
if you know where to look.</font>

618
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cold could kill us both.</font>

619
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you light a fire...
- No fire.</font>

620
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But a fire is...
- No fire.</font>

621
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have it your way.</font>

622
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll stay warmer if we stay close.</font>

623
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet you freeze to death before I do.</font>

624
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet your life.</font>

625
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think they're out looking for you?</font>

626
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?</font>

627
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

628
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're brave.</font>

629
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid,</font>

630
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">but brave.</font>

631
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">We start again at first light. Get some sleep.</font>

632
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop moving.</font>

633
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to get comfortable.</font>

634
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

635
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're still moving.
- Was I?</font>

636
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't notice that time.</font>

637
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cannot be true.</font>

638
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had ravens from White Harbor,</font>

639
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barrowton and the Dreadfort.</font>

640
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid it is true.</font>

641
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Why would Theon...</font>

642
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.</font>

643
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.</font>

644
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Rodrik Cassel is dead.</font>

645
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!</font>

646
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must go north at once.</font>

647
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's still a war to win, Your Grace.</font>

648
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?</font>

649
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
- You are a king.</font>

650
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.</font>

651
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go and talk to Theon.</font>

652
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be no talk. He will die for this.</font>

653
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.</font>

654
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.</font>

655
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can raise a few hundred men and retake
Winterfell before the new moon.</font>

656
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have the Lannisters on the run.</font>

657
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.</font>

658
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boy would be honored
to bring you Prince Theon's head.</font>

659
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your son Bran and
Rickon's safety is paramount.</font>

660
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.</font>

661
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.</font>

662
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I'll take his head myself.</font>

663
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:33,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?</font>

664
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no liar.</font>

665
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.</font>

666
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I done what I had to do to stay alive.</font>

667
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate the Starks as well as you do.</font>

668
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me serve you, my lord.</font>

669
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.</font>

670
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are other ways to serve, my lord.</font>

671
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
- There are other ways to serve, my prince.</font>

672
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

673
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know things, the free people.</font>

674
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know things?</font>

675
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

676
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to eat dirt?</font>

677
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Other things.</font>

678
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Savage things.</font>

679
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait outside.</font>

680
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wondered what you had under there.</font>

681
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">It comes at a price.</font>

682
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not killing you. That's your price.</font>

683
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already had that.</font>

684
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want then,</font>

685
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">other than your miserable life?</font>

686
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">What all free people want.</font>

687
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">My freedom.</font>

688
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you shall have it, then.</font>

689
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">But only if you serve me well.</font>

690
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ow!
- Shh.</font>

691
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.</font>

692
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">They thought so, too.</font>

693
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hated me, the man who hit me.</font>

694
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.</font>

695
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.</font>

696
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...</font>

697
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are everything he will never have.</font>

698
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your horse eats better than his children.</font>

699
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter now. He's dead.</font>

700
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have given them bread if I had it.</font>

701
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate the king more than any of them.</font>

702
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say these things.</font>

703
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the wrong people hear you...</font>

704
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not the wrong people.</font>

705
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't trust anybody.</font>

706
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is safer that way.</font>

707
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where are you going?</font>

708
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something for you from Prince Theon.</font>

709
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Me.</font>

710
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says I'm to make the rounds.</font>

711
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">And keep you warm.</font>

712
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.</font>

713
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Silk King won't support me
because of his business with the Lannisters.</font>

714
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why offend his best customer?</font>

715
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Copper King offers me a single ship</font>

716
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the condition that I lie with him for a night.</font>

717
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?</font>

718
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I came to this city, I had nothing.</font>

719
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truly nothing.</font>

720
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I slept by the docks.</font>

721
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.</font>

722
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, I dreamed of food.</font>

723
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.</font>

724
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
is always pure and honorable?</font>

725
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:28,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have done many things, Khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.</font>

726
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here I am, with no regrets.</font>

727
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bar the gates. Ring the bells.</font>

728
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly, Khaleesi.</font>

729
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

730
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are my dragons?
