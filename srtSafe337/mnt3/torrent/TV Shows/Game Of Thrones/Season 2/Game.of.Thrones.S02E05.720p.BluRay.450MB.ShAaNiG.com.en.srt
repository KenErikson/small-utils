1
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You swear it?
- By the mother.</font>

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.</font>

3
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I see no reason for hostility between us.</font>

4
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.</font>

5
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,</font>

6
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">provided he swears me an oath of fealty.</font>

7
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the wording of this oath?</font>

8
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.</font>

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.</font>

10
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in return for my son's loyalty?</font>

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.</font>

12
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">When that's done,</font>

13
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,</font>

14
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">as they have done many times before.</font>

15
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our two houses have always been close,</font>

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.</font>

17
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negotiate a peace with your brother.</font>

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negotiate with Stannis?</font>

19
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard him out there.</font>

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have better luck debating the wind.</font>

21
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please bring my terms to your son.</font>

22
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we are natural allies.</font>

23
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope he feels the same.</font>

24
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together we could end this war in a fortnight.</font>

25
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

26
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

27
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me!</font>

28
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!</font>

29
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to leave.</font>

30
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll hang you for this.</font>

31
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

32
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't leave him.</font>

33
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't avenge him if you're dead.</font>

34
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over there, go!</font>

35
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that way.</font>

36
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to go home.</font>

37
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Loras.
My lord, my lady.</font>

38
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

39
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis will be here in an hour.</font>

40
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.</font>

41
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your former companions
will fight for the privilege</font>

42
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">of selling you to their new king.</font>

43
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you want that privilege for yourself.</font>

44
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,</font>

45
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">not Stannis.</font>

46
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time for this.</font>

47
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ride back to Highgarden, sister.</font>

48
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not running from Stannis.</font>

49
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.</font>

50
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe that.</font>

51
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe that.</font>

52
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gained the most from our king's death?</font>

53
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis.</font>

54
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will put a sword through his righteous face.</font>

55
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't stay here.</font>

56
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would have been a true king,</font>

57
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">a good king.</font>

58
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Ser Loras,</font>

59
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do you desire most in this world?</font>

60
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Revenge.</font>

61
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,</font>

62
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,</font>

63
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">not today.</font>

64
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.</font>

65
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.</font>

66
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't avenge him from the grave.</font>

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the horses.</font>

68
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

69
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was very handsome.</font>

70
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was, Your Grace.</font>

71
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Your Grace. "</font>

72
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.</font>

73
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.</font>

74
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to be a queen?</font>

75
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

76
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be the queen.</font>

77
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killed? By whom?</font>

78
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accounts differ.</font>

79
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.</font>

80
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Who'd have thought?</font>

81
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,</font>

82
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it</font>

83
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">after negotiations went sour.</font>

84
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whomever did it, I say well done.</font>

85
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not what Varys says.</font>

86
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,</font>

87
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.</font>

88
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.</font>

89
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.</font>

90
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.</font>

91
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't there other things
you should be doing,</font>

92
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?</font>

93
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be safer in Dorne.</font>

94
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.</font>

95
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It so happens that I am.</font>

96
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.</font>

97
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">So clever.</font>

98
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?</font>

99
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schemes and plots are the same thing.</font>

100
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are going to attack us.</font>

101
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to be ready.</font>

102
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need to concern yourself over it.</font>

103
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.</font>

104
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?</font>

105
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.</font>

106
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer will be the same.</font>

107
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's important that we talk about this.</font>

108
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the king's royal prerogative</font>

109
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.</font>

110
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's wildfire.</font>

111
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildfire?</font>

112
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?</font>

113
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- That's a lie right there.</font>

114
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not a lie. Why would I lie?</font>

115
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me,</font>

116
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,</font>

117
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?</font>

118
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.</font>

119
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you the truth.</font>

120
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">The smart money would be on more likely.</font>

121
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's making wildfire.</font>

122
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
will give him sympathy for yours.</font>

123
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Alchemists' Guild
is being commissioned.</font>

124
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose there's only one way to find out.</font>

125
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.</font>

126
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are planning to launch it
from the city walls</font>

127
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">into Stannis' ships and armies.</font>

128
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

129
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did she tell you this?</font>

130
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard her talking with the pyromancer.</font>

131
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.</font>

132
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you.</font>

133
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear to me on what?</font>

134
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">On my life.</font>

135
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't care about your life.</font>

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,</font>

137
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...</font>

138
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right. Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.</font>

139
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get out.</font>

140
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn</font>

141
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.</font>

142
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.</font>

143
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be my pleasure.</font>

144
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

145
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

146
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.</font>

147
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.</font>

148
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fools love a fool.</font>

149
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.</font>

150
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to speak to you</font>

151
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- about what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you</font>

152
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.</font>

153
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, I...</font>

154
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.</font>

155
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.</font>

156
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've come to lecture me on truth?</font>

157
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to tell you that what I saw...</font>

158
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.</font>

159
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.</font>

160
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't be able to resist us now.</font>

161
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.</font>

162
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron...</font>

163
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll hear no more about it.</font>

164
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.</font>

165
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">When do we sail for King's Landing?</font>

166
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as I've consolidated my troops.</font>

167
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.</font>

168
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,</font>

169
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.</font>

170
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?</font>

171
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not your concern.</font>

172
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.</font>

173
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?</font>

174
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loyal service means telling hard truths.</font>

175
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, truth again.</font>

176
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what's the truth?</font>

177
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hard truth?</font>

178
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.</font>

179
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.</font>

180
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you believe?</font>

181
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won those bannermen from Renly.</font>

182
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't lose them to her.</font>

183
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.</font>

184
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.</font>

185
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea</font>

186
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">was spent evading ships, not attacking them.</font>

187
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other lords won't be happy.</font>

188
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky</font>

189
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hang them for treason.</font>

190
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.</font>

191
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got it! I've got it!</font>

192
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.</font>

193
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.</font>

194
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.</font>

195
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we have?</font>

196
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.</font>

197
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.</font>

198
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good thing. I'd be out of a job.</font>

199
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about your father?</font>

200
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.</font>

201
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's very busy.</font>

202
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.</font>

203
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,</font>

204
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.</font>

205
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corruption.
Yes!</font>

206
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are swollen, bloated, foul.</font>

207
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings</font>

208
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?</font>

209
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, a rotten king.</font>

210
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to argue with his assessment.</font>

211
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after what he did to your birthday present.</font>

212
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king is a lost cause.</font>

213
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.</font>

214
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls</font>

215
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.</font>

216
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to admire his imagination.</font>

217
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's talking about you.</font>

218
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Demon monkey?</font>

219
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">People think you're pulling the king's strings.</font>

220
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">They blame you for the city's ills.</font>

221
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blame me? I'm trying to save them.</font>

222
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to convince me.</font>

223
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Demon monkey.</font>

224
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, come on.</font>

225
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?</font>

226
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your commander. Welcome.</font>

227
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

228
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

229
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your captain commands you to stop!</font>

230
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we headed, Captain?</font>

231
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.</font>

232
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do yourjobs well.</font>

233
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who decides if we've done our jobs well?</font>

234
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

235
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your captain.</font>

236
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:57,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.</font>

237
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.</font>

238
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.</font>

239
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.</font>

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I need is a ship.</font>

241
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?</font>

242
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.</font>

243
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.</font>

244
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. We yield.</font>

245
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations on your first command.</font>

246
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.</font>

247
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm not here for you.</font>

248
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just on my way to Red Harbor.</font>

249
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.</font>

250
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too narrow.</font>

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.</font>

252
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would never happen.</font>

253
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.</font>

254
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">This lot, though...</font>

255
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy the Stony Shore.</font>

256
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'll take you out.</font>

257
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

258
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dagmer, your first mate.</font>

259
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you with the rest of them?</font>

260
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?</font>

261
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be good for a laugh.</font>

262
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.</font>

263
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?</font>

264
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not.</font>

265
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.</font>

266
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all Iron Islanders.</font>

267
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?</font>

268
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.</font>

269
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">The seat of the House of Tallhart,</font>

270
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.</font>

271
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could never hold it
for more than a few days.</font>

272
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,</font>

273
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Starks would send their men
to take it back.</font>

274
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then...</font>

275
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me to my ship.</font>

276
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks have overextended their lines.</font>

277
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time</font>

278
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">keeping their men and horses fed.</font>

279
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.</font>

280
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cold won't beat them.</font>

281
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.</font>

282
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.</font>

283
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,</font>

284
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.</font>

285
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is war, no one's content.</font>

286
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.</font>

287
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.</font>

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.</font>

289
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been waiting for him to fail.</font>

290
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not going to fail, not without our help.</font>

291
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how do we stop him?</font>

292
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've worked
through the night, my lord.</font>

293
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.</font>

294
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I think you would, Reginald.</font>

295
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.</font>

296
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.</font>

297
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife's in Lannisport.</font>

298
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then you'd better start riding.</font>

299
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.</font>

300
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your name wasn't Lannister,</font>

301
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!</font>

302
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not wine, water.</font>

303
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be here for some time.</font>

304
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl.</font>

305
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you from?</font>

306
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maidenpool, my lord.</font>

307
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.</font>

308
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">House Mooton, my lord.</font>

309
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is their sigil?</font>

310
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">A red salmon.</font>

311
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.</font>

312
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Northerner, aren't you?</font>

313
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. One more time, where are you from?</font>

314
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barrowton, my lord.</font>

315
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">House Dustin.</font>

316
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.</font>

317
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?</font>

318
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call him the Young Wolf.</font>

319
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

320
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.</font>

321
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.</font>

322
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he can't be killed.</font>

323
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you believe them?</font>

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord.</font>

325
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can be killed.</font>

326
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fetch that water.</font>

327
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl says nothing.</font>

328
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl keeps her mouth closed.</font>

329
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:22,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?</font>

330
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">A boy becomes a girl.</font>

331
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was always a girl.</font>

332
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was always aware.</font>

333
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the girl keeps secrets.</font>

334
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not for a man to spoil them.</font>

335
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one of them now.</font>

336
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have let you burn.</font>

337
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you fetch water for one of them now.</font>

338
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is this right for you and wrong for me?</font>

339
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.</font>

340
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

341
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here we are.</font>

342
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man pays his debts.</font>

343
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man owes three.</font>

344
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three what?</font>

345
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.</font>

346
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">And only death may pay for life.</font>

347
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved me and the two I was with.</font>

348
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole three deaths from the Red God.</font>

349
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to give them back.</font>

350
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak three names</font>

351
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the man will do the rest.</font>

352
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three lives I will give you,</font>

353
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">no more, no less,</font>

354
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're done.</font>

355
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can name anyone</font>

356
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll kill him?</font>

357
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man has said.</font>

358
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one who tortures everyone.</font>

359
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man needs a name.</font>

360
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know his name.</font>

361
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call him the Tickler.</font>

362
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is enough.</font>

363
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.</font>

364
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not here yet.</font>

365
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd have seen us, blown the horn.</font>

366
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will he come?</font>

367
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Halfhand does things in his own time.</font>

368
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle told me stories about him.</font>

369
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of them are true.</font>

370
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.</font>

371
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole winter.</font>

372
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.</font>

373
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had to wait for the thaw.</font>

374
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.</font>

375
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, possible for the Halfhand.</font>

376
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beautiful, isn't it?</font>

377
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilly would love it here.</font>

378
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.</font>

379
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">About time you did something.</font>

380
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least you'll keep warm.</font>

381
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fist of the First Men.</font>

382
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of how old this place is.</font>

383
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,</font>

384
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.</font>

385
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I die, please, stop talking.</font>

386
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:55,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands and thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here where we're standing</font>

387
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">all through the long night.</font>

388
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think they were like,
the First Men?</font>

389
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid.</font>

390
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.</font>

391
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they were afraid.</font>

392
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they came here
to get away from something.</font>

393
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't think it worked.</font>

394
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildlings?</font>

395
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">One blast is for rangers returning.</font>

396
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildlings is two blasts.</font>

397
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you got to stand there waiting,</font>

398
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">wondering.</font>

399
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">One blast for friends,</font>

400
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">two for foes.</font>

401
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">And three for White Walkers.</font>

402
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a thousand years,</font>

403
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.</font>

404
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?</font>

405
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well...
I read it in a book.</font>

406
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

407
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Qhorin Halfhand.</font>

408
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, we'll live another day.</font>

409
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurrah.</font>

410
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take care, my lord.</font>

411
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,</font>

412
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "</font>

413
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.</font>

414
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could well be true.</font>

415
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:39,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,</font>

416
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, of course, flesh.</font>

417
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.</font>

418
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
to the Targaryen power.</font>

419
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">My companion takes issue.</font>

420
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:03,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could tell you how many crazy old men
I've seen pushing carts around army camps</font>

421
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.</font>

422
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.</font>

423
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">The substance is fire given form.</font>

424
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.</font>

425
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">To do what?</font>

426
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.</font>

427
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do you have?</font>

428
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,</font>

429
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,</font>

430
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">but all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.</font>

431
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, this man is insulting.</font>

432
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man,</font>

433
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">but things can get a bit messy.</font>

434
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
he's flinging them right back at us.</font>

435
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men die, men shit themselves, men run,</font>

436
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means pots falling,</font>

437
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means fire inside the walls,</font>

438
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.</font>

439
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend remains unconvinced.</font>

440
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.</font>

441
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's not living anymore.</font>

442
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?</font>

443
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men win wars, not magic tricks.</font>

444
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,</font>

445
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.</font>

446
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:44,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our present count stands at 7,811.</font>

447
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:50,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
and armies both.</font>

448
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a shit idea.</font>

449
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.</font>

450
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.</font>

451
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.</font>

452
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be making it for me.</font>

453
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be able to feed himself from now on.</font>

454
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him sleep, Doreah.</font>

455
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Khaleesi.</font>

456
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loves you.</font>

457
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rewove this part of the top.</font>

458
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I fixed the heel on this one.</font>

459
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, my friend.</font>

460
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?</font>

461
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.</font>

462
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is known.</font>

463
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...</font>

464
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.</font>

465
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">May he ride forever through the night lands.</font>

466
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:37,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.</font>

467
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men like to talk about other men
when they're happy.</font>

468
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would look like a real princess
in Xaro's...</font>

469
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.</font>

470
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should wear it, Khaleesi.</font>

471
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are their guest. It would be rude not to.</font>

472
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you must visit the night market.</font>

473
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Qartheen night market
is like no night market you've ever seen.</font>

474
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds wonderful.</font>

475
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Meereenis think they have a night market.</font>

476
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take you there myself.</font>

477
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please excuse me for a moment.</font>

478
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing?</font>

479
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.</font>

480
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.</font>

481
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.</font>

482
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.</font>

483
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or melt it. Very simple.</font>

484
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are his guests!</font>

485
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.</font>

486
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not, Khaleesi!</font>

487
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will wait until we leave.</font>

488
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even when we leave.</font>

489
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

490
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our host saved us from the
Red Waste and you want to steal from him?</font>

491
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will hear no more.</font>

492
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother used to say
the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do</font>

493
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">was steal things better men have built.</font>

494
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the only thing.</font>

495
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're quite good at killing the better men.</font>

496
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.</font>

497
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother of Dragons.</font>

498
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.</font>

499
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">A demonstration?</font>

500
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this gem.</font>

501
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at it.</font>

502
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Into its depths.</font>

503
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many facets.</font>

504
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.</font>

505
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Often more than once.</font>

506
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should you grow tired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,</font>

507
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would be an honor
to host you at the House of the Undying.</font>

508
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.</font>

509
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">My apologies.</font>

510
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.</font>

511
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.</font>

512
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.</font>

513
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the House of the Undying?</font>

514
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books</font>

515
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">and drink shade of the evening.</font>

516
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:55,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.</font>

517
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">So soft, they actually believe
their parlor tricks are magic.</font>

518
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You watch over her.</font>

519
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I know you?</font>

520
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you.</font>

521
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.</font>

522
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

523
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no one.</font>

524
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she is the Mother of Dragons.</font>

525
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.</font>

526
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">They shall come day and night
to see the wonder born into the world again.</font>

527
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they see, they shall lust,</font>

528
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">for dragons are fire made flesh.</font>

529
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And fire is power.</font>

530
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looked like Stannis.</font>

531
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me it just looked like...</font>

532
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">A shadow in the shape of a man.</font>

533
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the shape of Stannis.</font>

534
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.</font>

535
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stay there long, my lady?</font>

536
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.</font>

537
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, I will leave for Winterfell.</font>

538
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">My two youngest need me.</font>

539
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been away from them for far too long.</font>

540
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew my mother.</font>

541
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

542
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">My own mother died on the birthing bed</font>

543
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was very young.</font>

544
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bloody business.</font>

545
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What comes after is even harder.</font>

546
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,</font>

547
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you give me leave to go, my lady?</font>

548
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean to kill Stannis.</font>

549
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swore a vow.</font>

550
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Stannis has a great army around him.</font>

551
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.</font>

552
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm as good as any of them.</font>

553
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should never have fled.</font>

554
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly's death was no fault of yours.</font>

555
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">You served him bravely.</font>

556
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only held him that once</font>

557
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">as he was dying.</font>

558
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gone, Brienne.</font>

559
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.</font>

560
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.</font>

561
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not know your son, my lady.</font>

562
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I could serve you, if you would have me.</font>

563
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have courage.</font>

564
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,</font>

565
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">a woman's kind of courage.</font>

566
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.</font>

567
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.</font>

568
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.</font>

569
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I am yours, my lady.</font>

570
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will shield your back
and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.</font>

571
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.</font>

572
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home</font>

573
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">and at my table</font>

574
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonor.</font>

575
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.</font>

576
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's not just thieves, my lord.</font>

577
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's wolves in them hills now,</font>

578
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than I ever seen.</font>

579
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.</font>

580
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.</font>

581
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.</font>

582
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.</font>

583
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't keep watch all day and all night.</font>

584
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you</font>

585
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help watch over your flock</font>

586
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can give them room and board.</font>

587
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife always prayed for more children.</font>

588
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.</font>

589
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And may the gods bless you and yours.</font>

590
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

591
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.</font>

592

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good.
- Hodor.</font>

593
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,159

is barely 40 leagues from here.</font>

596
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can the Lannisters strike so far north?</font>

597
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.</font>

598
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.</font>

599
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to help them.</font>

600
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.</font>

601
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you need so many?</font>

602
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?</font>

603
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.</font>

604
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.</font>

605
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what does it mean?</font>

606
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.</font>

607
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.</font>

608
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must not mean anything, then.</font>

609
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying.</font>

610
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.</font>

611
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.</font>

612
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't give me an honest answer.</font>

613
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the same as being a liar.</font>

614
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not far off.</font>

615
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?</font>

616
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.</font>

617
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now who's a liar?</font>

618
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see in your dream?</font>

619
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something bad?</font>

620
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, boy.</font>

621
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.</font>

622
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw waves crashing against the gates</font>

623
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the water came flowing over the walls...</font>

624
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">It flooded the castle.</font>

625
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drowned men were floating here,</font>

626
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the yard.</font>

627
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Rodrik was one of them.</font>

628
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sea is hundreds of miles away.</font>

629
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

630
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.</font>

631
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.</font>

632
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Osha.</font>

633
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">The three-eyed raven,</font>

634
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do they say about it north of the Wall?</font>

635
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.</font>

636
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.
Where?</font>

637
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">On that mountain.</font>

638
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see very well.</font>

639
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fire.</font>

640
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a fire.</font>

641
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.</font>

642
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.</font>

643
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.</font>

644
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many wildlings have joined him?</font>

645
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:59,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">From what we can tell, all of them.</font>

646
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.</font>

647
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're almost ready to make their move.</font>

648
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- Somewhere safe.</font>

649
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhere south.</font>

650
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't just march into their midst.</font>

651
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.</font>

652
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saying we should fall back to the Wall?</font>

653
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance was one of us once.</font>

654
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's one of them.</font>

655
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.</font>

656
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.</font>

657
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,</font>

658
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">more like us.</font>

659
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.</font>

660
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sneak in, kill Mance,</font>

661
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.</font>

662
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.</font>

663
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a job for 400 men.</font>

664
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to move fast and silent.</font>

665
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.</font>

666
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.</font>

667
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.</font>

668
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.</font>

669
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've fought and killed a wight.</font>

670
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many rangers can say that?</font>

671
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the one?</font>

672
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. You killed a wight.</font>

673
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.</font>

674
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craster?</font>

675
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.</font>

676
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.</font>

677
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be no trouble.</font>

678
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.</font>

679
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

680
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, tell me,</font>

681
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">how long has your manservant
been in love with you?</font>

682
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.</font>

683
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's my advisor,</font>

684
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">my friend.</font>

685
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlikely.</font>

686
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can almost always tell what a man wants.</font>

687
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about what a woman wants?</font>

688
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much more complicated.</font>

689
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, for example, what do you want?</font>

690
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.</font>

691
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

692
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them</font>

693
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">and find them a safe home.</font>

694
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?</font>

695
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want them because they're mine by right.</font>

696
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:56,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.</font>

697
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, a conqueror.</font>

698
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?</font>

699
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:05,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,</font>

700
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.</font>

701
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.</font>

702
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.</font>

703
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?</font>

704
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the gates of the city, you bled for me.</font>

705
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

706
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will show you why.</font>

707
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.</font>

708
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hardest steel does not make a mark.</font>

709
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:46,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
their weight in gold if they could break into it.</font>

710
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.</font>

711
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all went home empty-handed.</font>

712
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that can open this door</font>

713
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">is this key.</font>

714
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">And behind the door?</font>

715
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it can all be mine?</font>

716
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">All? Let us say half.</font>

717
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...</font>

718
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to go home.</font>

719
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I have to do?</font>

720
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is marry me.</font>

721
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a romantic proposal.</font>

722
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:28,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.</font>

723
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come from nothing.</font>

724
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.</font>

725
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms</font>

726
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:43,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our children
will be princes and princesses.</font>

727
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

728
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have more ambition than you thought.</font>

729
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.</font>

730
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Baratheon is dead.</font>

731
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...</font>

732
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.</font>

733
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four false kings destroying the country.</font>

734
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.</font>

735
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">The usurper is dead.</font>

736
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.</font>

737
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?</font>

738
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army</font>

739
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.</font>

740
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.</font>

741
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.</font>

742
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.</font>

743
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,</font>

744
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd all be dead by now.</font>

745
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,</font>

746
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.</font>

747
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I only want...
- What do you want?</font>

748
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

749
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To see you on the Iron Throne.
- Why?</font>

750
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a good claim.</font>

751
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">A title. A birthright.</font>

752
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you have something more than that.</font>

753
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.</font>

754
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.</font>

755
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who can rule and should rule.</font>

756
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.</font>

757
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.</font>

758
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?</font>

759
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make your own way.</font>

760
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find your own ship. You only need one.</font>

761
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.</font>

762
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do I get the ship?</font>

763
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find it for you.</font>

764
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sound ship with a good captain.</font>

765
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look forward to meeting him.</font>

766
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi.</font>

767
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should stand sideface.</font>

768
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sideface?</font>

769
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sideways.</font>

770
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

771
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smaller target.</font>

772
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I fighting someone?</font>

773
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're practicing for a fight.</font>

774
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should practice right.</font>

775
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guards!</font>

776
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see anything?</font>

777
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.</font>

778
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go up the battlement.</font>

779
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move away.</font>

780
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand back. He's dead.
