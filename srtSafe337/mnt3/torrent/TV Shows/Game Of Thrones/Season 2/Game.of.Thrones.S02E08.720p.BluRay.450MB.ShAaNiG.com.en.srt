- What envy?</font>

4

<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.</font>

5
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,333

with 20 men.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a great warrior.</font>

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the bodies above your gates.</font>

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?</font>

9
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I treated the Stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.</font>

10
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?</font>

11
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I had to kill them,</font>

12

<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

15
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.</font>

16
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that treachery?</font>

17
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd call it bravery.</font>

18
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,869

21
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't call me...
- A cunt.</font>

22
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,920

the only two Starks in Winterfell.</font>

23

the Northerners would think me weak.</font>

25

26

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warning you.</font>

27
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,684

defend Winterfell with just this lot?</font>

54
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,746

I looked down at you.</font>

83

84

<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, on your feet, now.</font>

87
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it.</font>

88

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you'll be very happy.</font>

93
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're marrying her for a bridge?</font>

94
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An important bridge.
- Ah.</font>

95
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was before they killed my father.</font>

96
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,373

99

100
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,511

about their fathers, believe me.</font>

103
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,</font>

104
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.</font>

yours to protect.</font>

107

<font color="#FFFFFF">The soldiers you order into battle.</font>

108
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.</font>

109
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't believe him.</font>

110
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"</font>

111
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.</font>

112
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could have met him.</font>

113

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?</font>

120
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,757

until the Lannisters are defeated.</font>

121

00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me this isn't true.</font>

127
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

128
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the girls.</font>

129
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,508

strangled with a chain.</font>

137

<font color="#FFFFFF">You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?</font>

138
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,</font>

139
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,295

00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?</font>

151
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forty, Your Grace.</font>

152
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send another 40 with our fastest horses.</font>

153
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb.</font>

154
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

155
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're much uglier in daylight.</font>

156
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

157
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.</font>

158
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.</font>

159
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brienne of Tarth.</font>

160
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.</font>

161
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crescent moons and starbursts.</font>

162
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord...</font>

163
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selwyn Tarth. Your father.</font>

164
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?</font>

165
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.</font>

166
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you known many men?</font>

167
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose not.</font>

168
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women?</font>

169
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horses? Ah.</font>

170
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.</font>

171
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.</font>

172
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?</font>

173
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,</font>

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">the weak, the innocent.</font>

175
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?</font>

176
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not provoke me to anger.</font>

177
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already have. Look at you.</font>

178
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're ready to chop my head off.</font>

179
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you could?</font>

180
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?</font>

181
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen you fight.</font>

182
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer is no.</font>

183
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.</font>

184
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not one of them.</font>

185
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my life men like you have sneered at me.</font>

186
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.</font>

187
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.</font>

188
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you take me for an idiot? In!</font>

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took you for a fighter, a man...</font>

190
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon. Woman of honor.</font>

191
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I wrong?</font>

192
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid.</font>

193
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.</font>

194
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.</font>

195
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.</font>

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surrender the Iron Throne?</font>

197
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.</font>

198
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis will execute them all.</font>

199
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, a king who runs will not be king for long.</font>

200
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.</font>

201
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.</font>

202
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.</font>

203
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,</font>

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">he lured us into a trap.</font>

205
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why my son is his prisoner.</font>

206
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too close to Casterly Rock.</font>

207
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.</font>

208
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.</font>

209
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.</font>

210
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.</font>

211
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll risk anything at any time</font>

212
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.</font>

213
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll ride at nightfall.</font>

214
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.</font>

215
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.</font>

216
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.</font>

217
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl has proven herself a good servant.</font>

218
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll stay on with you.</font>

219
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.</font>

220
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.</font>

221
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got some
questions to answer.</font>

222
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who killed Ser Amory?</font>

223
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know! Please!
- Give me the name.</font>

224
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take this one out for the crows.
- I told you, I don't know.</font>

225
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

226
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.</font>

227
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.</font>

228
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Jaqen?</font>

229
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't care.</font>

230
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your stick now, bitch?</font>

231
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised to fuck you with it.</font>

232
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, time to kill some wolves.</font>

233
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need sour cherries to make it right.</font>

234
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.</font>

235
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.</font>

236
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.</font>

237
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Jaqen?</font>

238
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How would I know?
- I need him now.</font>

239
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?</font>

240
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's helping me.</font>

241
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw him.
- Where?</font>

242
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where? Where?
- Ow!</font>

243
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.</font>

244
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">On patrol.</font>

245
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go of my ears.</font>

246
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want with him anyway?</font>

247
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mance is gonna march on the Wall.</font>

248
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.</font>

249
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They'll never trust me.
- They might.</font>

250
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?</font>

251
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it feel
knowing those men all died</font>

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?</font>

253
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't.
- I should have known better,</font>

254
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">trusting a traitor's bastard.</font>

255
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not yours to kill, crow.</font>

256
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have to do that here?</font>

257
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to keep me hands clean.</font>

258
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but do you have to do it here?</font>

259
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should start wearing the gold cloak.</font>

260
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to wear a gold cloak.</font>

261
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're commander of the City Watch.</font>

262
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.</font>

263
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes it hard to move quietly.</font>

264
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.</font>

265
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.</font>

266
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to stand out.</font>

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.</font>

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, fine.</font>

269
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">No gold cloak.</font>

270
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

271
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What? What?</font>

272
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you staring at me?</font>

273
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.</font>

274
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I here?</font>

275
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.</font>

276
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis will be here any day.</font>

277

284
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance</font>

285
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">these last few weeks.</font>

286
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?</font>

287
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not know.</font>

288
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?</font>

289
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.</font>

290
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">For questioning?</font>

291
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

292
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.</font>

293
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.</font>

294
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever been in a city under siege?</font>

295
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,499

<font color="#FFFFFF">See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.</font>

297
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Food's worth more than gold.</font>

298
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.</font>

299
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.</font>

300
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thieves, they love a siege.</font>

301
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.</font>

302
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.</font>

303
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.</font>

304
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

305
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Great Sieges of Westeros."</font>

306
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thrilling subject.</font>

307
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.</font>

308
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis knows King's Landing.</font>

309
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows where the walls are strongest,</font>

310
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he knows which gates are weakest.</font>

311
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mud Gate.</font>

312
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good ram will batter it down in minutes,</font>

313
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's only 50 yards from the water.</font>

314
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where he'll land.</font>

315
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,</font>

316
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is our plan?</font>

317
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could throw books at his men.</font>

318
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have that many books.</font>

319
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have that many men, either.</font>

320
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we have?</font>

321
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pig shit.</font>

322
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not cut out for this sort of work.</font>

323
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.</font>

324
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.</font>

325
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't imagine anything much worse.</font>

326
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lack imagination.</font>

327
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think Jon is right now?</font>

328
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went off with the Half hand.
He didn't come back.</font>

329
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">A betting man would go with dead.</font>

330
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not dead.</font>

331
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Jon's a great fighter.</font>

332
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.</font>

333
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a Valyrian steel sword.</font>

334
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did his father.</font>

335
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Qhorin Half hand
is the greatest ranger alive.</font>

336
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great rangers never get old is the problem.</font>

337
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit ones neither.</font>

338
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's them in the middle that last a long time.</font>

339
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in seven hells is that?</font>

340
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">The First Men made these marks.</font>

341
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me with it.</font>

342
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

343
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you find something you're not supposed to,</font>

344
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.</font>

345
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a Night's Watch cloak.</font>

346
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been here a long time.</font>

347
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

348
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be dragonglass.</font>

349
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragonglass?</font>

350
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">The maesters call it obsidian.</font>

351
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would a brother hide it here?</font>

352
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.</font>

353
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind where you're going.</font>

354
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I'll...</font>

355
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you?</font>

356
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man has patrol duty.</font>

357
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.</font>

358
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl owes one more name.</font>

359
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.</font>

360
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?</font>

361
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">A minute, an hour, a month.</font>

362
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death is certain,</font>

363
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">the time is not.</font>

364
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's taking his army to attack my brother.</font>

365
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need him dead right now.</font>

366
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">This a man cannot do.</font>

367
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised you'd help me.</font>

368
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.</font>

369
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be others. Give a name, any name.</font>

370
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll kill them?</font>

371
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody?</font>

372
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,</font>

373
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it.</font>

374
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

375
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaqen H'ghar.</font>

376
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl gives a man his own name?</font>

377
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.</font>

378
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.</font>

379
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man can go kill himself.</font>

380
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Un-name me.</font>

381
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Please?</font>

382
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll un-name you.</font>

383
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.</font>

384
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would require more than one life.</font>

385
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.</font>

386
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl lacks honor.</font>

387
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I do this thing, a girl must obey.</font>

388
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl will obey.</font>

389
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.</font>

390
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Podrick.</font>

391
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odd little boy.</font>

392
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.</font>

393
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Varys both.</font>

394
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent lamprey pie.</font>

395
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?</font>

396
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.</font>

397
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">An inspiration for the troops.</font>

398
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young king in his shining armor</font>

399
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.</font>

400
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's only a boy.</font>

401
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Younger boys are off fighting his war.</font>

402
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?</font>

403
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.</font>

404
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,</font>

405
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">some don't.</font>

406
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">His place is not on the battlefield.</font>

407
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not on the throne, either,</font>

408
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">sadly for all of us.</font>

409
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm an idiot?</font>

410
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.</font>

411
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shipped off my only daughter.</font>

412
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.</font>

413
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.</font>

414
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has the finest armor gold can buy.</font>

415
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to be out there.</font>

416
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them</font>

417
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.</font>

418
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any dessert?</font>

419
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?</font>

420
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.</font>

421
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.</font>

422
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he doesn't have a cock.</font>

423
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither do you.</font>

424
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.</font>

425
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.</font>

426
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.</font>

427
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that little.</font>

428
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you smiling?</font>

429
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm happy.</font>

430
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why are you happy?</font>

431
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I have your little whore.</font>

432
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you preferred blondes.</font>

433
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a droll little fellow.</font>

434
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, have you married this one yet?</font>

435
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

436
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Father will be so pleased.</font>

437
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you care who I fuck?</font>

438
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because a Lannister always pays her debts.</font>

439
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole my only daughter,</font>

440
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">you plot to have Joffrey killed.</font>

441
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.</font>

442
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You need me.
- For what?</font>

443
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your skill in battle?</font>

444
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty thing, your whore.</font>

445
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely body.</font>

446
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bruises will heal in time.</font>

447
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find her?</font>

448
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.</font>

449
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, a Lannister lion necklace?</font>

450
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.</font>

451
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.</font>

452
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh?</font>

453
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're the expert. Tell me.</font>

454
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't buy them,</font>

455
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">you only rent them.</font>

456
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're usually a better liar, baby brother.</font>

457
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one you like.</font>

458
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like her very much.</font>

459
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could it be love?</font>

460
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.</font>

461
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless Joffrey is hurt.</font>

462
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.</font>

463
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he dies,</font>

464
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.</font>

465
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?</font>

466
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to see her?</font>

467
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might.</font>

468
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.</font>

469
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry they hurt you.</font>

470
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be brave.</font>

471
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise I will free you.</font>

472
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget me.</font>

473
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.</font>

474
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will hurt you for this.</font>

475
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,</font>

476
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.</font>

477
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will know the debt is paid.</font>

478
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

479
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae!</font>

480
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been waiting all night.</font>

481
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong?</font>

482
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're beautiful.</font>

483
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why do you look sad?</font>

484
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to be more careful.</font>

485
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.</font>

486
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people who want to hurt me.</font>

487
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I won't let them.</font>

488
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll cut off their faces. I will.</font>

489
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would kill for you. Do you know that?</font>

490
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect I'll have to before this is over.</font>

491
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mine.</font>

492
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm yours.</font>

493
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me.</font>

494
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm yours, and you are mine.</font>

495
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still no word?</font>

496
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.</font>

497
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.</font>

498
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.</font>

499
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.</font>

500
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.</font>

501
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send word to your son.</font>

502
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.</font>

503
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...</font>

504
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.</font>

505
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">He betrayed our cause.</font>

506
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">He betrayed me.</font>

507
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.</font>

508
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.</font>

509
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.</font>

510
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

511
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

512
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I?</font>

513
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had to arrest my mother.</font>

514
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters have my sisters.</font>

515
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man I considered my closest friend</font>

516
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">has seized my home and my brothers.</font>

517
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.</font>

518
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.</font>

519
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

520
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

521
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being kind.</font>

522
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have no right.
- You have every right.</font>

523
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a king.</font>

524
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the kind of king I want to be.</font>

525
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind do you want to be?</font>

526
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

527
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">The good kind.</font>

528
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most kings grew up as princes.</font>

529
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.</font>

530
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.</font>

531
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was raised to be a proper little lady,</font>

532
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.</font>

533
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to hear you play the harp.</font>

534
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, you would not.</font>

535
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry</font>

536
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sawing off men's feet?</font>

537
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 12,</font>

538
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">my mother and father went to a wedding.</font>

539
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.</font>

540
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they left me with my little brother.</font>

541
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.</font>

542
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.</font>

543
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.</font>

544
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rich, the poor, we were all there.</font>

545
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.</font>

546
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.</font>

547
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was treading water,</font>

548
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking to a friend,</font>

549
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.</font>

550
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I called his name.</font>

551
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I started screaming his name.</font>

552
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I saw him...</font>

553
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">floating face down.</font>

554
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">My heart just... stopped.</font>

555
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was...</font>

556
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dragged him from the water.</font>

557
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend helped me, I think.</font>

558
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even remember.</font>

559
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was so little.</font>

560
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.</font>

561
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I screamed at him and I shook him.</font>

562
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was dead.</font>

563
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just dead.</font>

564
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man ran over.</font>

565
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a fish tattoo on his face.</font>

566
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.</font>

567
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:17,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.</font>

568
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this man worked on a fishing boat.</font>

569
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he pushed me out of the way.</font>

570
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,</font>

571
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's death for the man, a terrible death.</font>

572
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he pushed me out of the way,</font>

573
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he started pressing on my brother's chest</font>

574
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">again and again and again,</font>

575
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">until my brother spat out</font>

576
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">half of the Rhoyne and cried out.</font>

577
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.</font>

578
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I decided two things that day.</font>

579
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:10,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.</font>

580
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I came of age,</font>

581
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never live in a slave city again.</font>

582
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Your Grace.</font>

583
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.</font>

584
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to marry the Frey girl.</font>

585
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you to marry her.</font>

586
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you needed that bridge.</font>

587
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.</font>

588
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.</font>

589
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

590
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.</font>

591
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nice, warm oven.</font>

592
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. What did you bring?</font>

593
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cheese could be better.</font>

594
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did get some nice sausages.</font>

595
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he want us
to do about those guards?</font>

596
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say.</font>

597
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just said, "Walk through the gates."</font>

598
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the guards?</font>

599
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say anything about the guards.</font>

600
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, he left that bit out?</font>

601
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pretty important part, don't you think?</font>

602
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to trust him.</font>

603
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust him?</font>

604
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.</font>

605
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.</font>

606
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here if you're afraid.</font>

607
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arry, don't.</font>

608
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Away!</font>

609
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reset!</font>

610
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.</font>

611
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will it hold?</font>

612
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.</font>

613
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, pull!</font>

614
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire you, Ser Davos.</font>

615
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.</font>

616
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.</font>

617
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you take the onion for your sigil,</font>

618
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.</font>

619
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son wishes me to change it.</font>

620
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.</font>

621
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand why
the older families look down at me.</font>

622
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you? Why?</font>

623
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father was a crabber.
- And?</font>

624
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.</font>

625
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our hands stink.</font>

626
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?</font>

627
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many fought bravely for your brother.</font>

628
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many fought for the Mad King.</font>

629
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.</font>

630
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some are happy to do it to my face.</font>

631
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were forgotten.</font>

632
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.</font>

633
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,</font>

634
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,</font>

635
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I held Storm's End with 500 men.</font>

636
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.</font>

637
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.</font>

638
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?</font>

639
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, we ate the horses.</font>

640
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.</font>

641
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.</font>

642
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.</font>

643
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do like dogs.</font>

644
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.</font>

645
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.</font>

646
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.</font>

647
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you made it through the lines.</font>

648
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.</font>

649
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.</font>

650
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.</font>

651
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was relieved they did not.</font>

652
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.</font>

653
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.</font>

654
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Insult or no, I gave it up.</font>

655
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king</font>

656
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've always done my duty.</font>

657
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.</font>

658
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.</font>

659
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

660
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray I serve you well.</font>

661
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.</font>

662
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.</font>

663
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:12,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">No man can be in all rooms at all times.</font>

664
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have many little birds in the North, my lord,</font>

665
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.</font>

666
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.</font>

667
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">To strike?</font>

668
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?</font>

669
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?</font>

670
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,</font>

671
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ride out to greet him.</font>

672
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">A brave choice, Your Grace.</font>

673
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure your men will line up behind you.</font>

674
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say Stannis never smiles.</font>

675
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give him a red smile</font>

676
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">from ear to ear.</font>

677
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine Stannis' terror.</font>

678
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am trying.</font>

679
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an intelligent man.</font>

680
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.</font>

681
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.</font>

682
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.</font>

683
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish we could, too.</font>

684
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

685
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

686
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're going to play, you'll have to start.</font>

687
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother was
the youngest Kingsguard in history.</font>

688
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister became queen at the age of 19.</font>

689
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I reached manhood,</font>

690
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.</font>

691
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A most highborn plumber.</font>

692
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water never flowed better.</font>

693
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all the shit found its way to the sea.</font>

694
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never expected to have any real power.</font>

695
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when my father named me acting Hand...</font>

696
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're quite good at being Hand, you know?</font>

697
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.</font>

698
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honorable men.</font>

699
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they disdained the game
and those who played.</font>

700
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You enjoy the game.
- I do.</font>

701
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last thing I expected.</font>

702
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you play it well.</font>

703
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to keep playing it.</font>

704
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.</font>

705
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:23,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.</font>

706
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,</font>

707
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Drowned God wants them drowned.</font>

708
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?</font>

709
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the god of tits and wine?</font>

710
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Summer lsles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.</font>

711
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should sail there immediately.</font>

712
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">This morning, I heard a song</font>

713
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.</font>

714
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys Targaryen lives.</font>

715
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.</font>

716
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has three dragons.</font>

717
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">But even if what they say is true,</font>

718
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">it'll be years before they are fully grown.</font>

719
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then there will be nowhere to hide.</font>

720
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">One game at a time, my friend.</font>

721
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, Khaleesi.</font>

722
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:29,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.</font>

723
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found one.</font>

724
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ship with a good captain.</font>

725
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.</font>

726
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Astapor?</font>

727
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot stay here.</font>

728
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.</font>

729
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not your children.</font>

730
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,</font>

731
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you didn't grow them in your womb.</font>

732
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.</font>

733
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.</font>

734
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.</font>

735
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I would die for you.</font>

736
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will never abandon you.</font>

737
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.</font>

738
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then serve me.</font>

739
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying, then take me there.</font>

740
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what the warlock wants.</font>

741
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told you so himself.</font>

742
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.</font>

743
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?</font>

744
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.</font>

745
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?</font>

746
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until my last breath, I will remember.</font>

747
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">After I have forgotten my mother's face.</font>

748
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are my children.</font>

749
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they are the only children I will ever have.</font>

750
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me to them.</font>

751
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should bury them.</font>

752
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.</font>

753
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.</font>

754
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you say.</font>

755
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.</font>

756
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.</font>

757
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">For his trouble.</font>

758
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">His troubles are done.</font>

759
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's feeding the crops now.</font>

760
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">His wife, too.</font>

761
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.</font>

762
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.</font>

763
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.</font>

764
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:19,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.</font>

765
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right</font>

766
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">so far.</font>

767
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?</font>

768
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have been the farmer's boys.</font>

769
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed them and burned them</font>

770
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">and passed them off as the little lords?</font>

771
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">They mustn't know.</font>

772
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bran would blame himself.</font>

773
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll never hear it from me.</font>

774
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little lads have suffered enough.</font>
