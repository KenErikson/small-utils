1
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

2
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tide's against us.</font>

3
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, but we have the wind.</font>

4
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll blow us straight to the gates.</font>

5
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're coming home.</font>

6
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.</font>

7
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.</font>

8
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm sailing right at them.</font>

9
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the royal fleet.</font>

10
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.</font>

11
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, there are...
several royal fleets at the moment.</font>

12
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after tonight.</font>

13
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne</font>

14
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will be his Hand.</font>

15
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gods be good.
- God.</font>

16
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.</font>

17
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But not over them?
- Over all of us.</font>

18
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people of King's Landing did not
choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.</font>

19
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be glad to see his head on a spike.</font>

20
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, first, we have to put it there.</font>

21
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.</font>

22
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.</font>

23
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those walls have never been breached,</font>

24
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the men guarding the walls,</font>

25
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they see you, they don't see a liberator,</font>

26
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">they see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.</font>

27
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have faith in the Lord of Light.</font>

28
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have faith in our cause.</font>

29
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have faith in my captain.</font>

30
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you afraid, my lion?</font>

31
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.</font>

32
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I'm afraid.</font>

33
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't let them hurt you.</font>

34
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Lannister.</font>

35
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a choice in all this.</font>

36
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not your war.</font>

37
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is now.</font>

38
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fuck your way out of everything.</font>

39
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have so far.</font>

40
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?</font>

41
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.</font>

42
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know, Your Grace,</font>

43
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is not only the sworn duty of a maester</font>

44
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,</font>

45
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">but also to offer guidance</font>

46
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">and counsel in times of war.</font>

47
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your words are always wise and measured.</font>

48
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you could...
- If anything,</font>

49
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">a maester's duties become more urgent</font>

50
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">in times of war and turmoil.</font>

51
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember back in the days of King...</font>

52
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought me something?</font>

53
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

54
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Essence of nightshade</font>

55
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">is as dangerous as it is efficacious.</font>

56
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">A single drop in a cup of wine</font>

57
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">suffices to soothe ragged nerves.</font>

58
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three drops will bring on
a deep and dreamless sleep.</font>

59
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten drops, however...</font>

60
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what ten drops will bring.</font>

61
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace, if I may ask...</font>

62
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may not.</font>

63
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have a lot of work to do.</font>

64
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.</font>

65
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. A siege is very...</font>

66
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.</font>

67
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

68
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so he spoke</font>

69
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Lord of Castamere</font>

70
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:13,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now the rains weep o'er his halls</font>

71
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">With no one there to hear</font>

72
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls</font>

73
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:28,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not a soul to hear</font>

74
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good boys!
- Lannisters!</font>

75
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you learn the Lannister song?</font>

76
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drunk Lannisters.</font>

77
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a pretty voice.</font>

78
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you very much.</font>

79
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I like your nose.</font>

80
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times you break it?</font>

81
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now let's see.</font>

82
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time, I was five.</font>

83
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
- Oh.</font>

84
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't me she was aiming at.</font>

85
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was trying for my little brother.</font>

86
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he was a real pest.</font>

87
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second time, I was nine.</font>

88
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got in a scrap with a few older boys.</font>

89
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won.</font>

90
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Third time...</font>

91
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.</font>

92
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor nose.</font>

93
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't feel sorry for him.</font>

94
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be halfway up your arse
before the night's through.</font>

95
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, friends.</font>

96
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">This round's on me.</font>

97
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think he likes me.</font>

98
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're a hard man?</font>

99
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it.</font>

100
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's warm in here.</font>

101
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got beautiful women</font>

102
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">and good brown ale.</font>

103
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plenty for everyone.</font>

104
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all you want</font>

105
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to put one of us in the cold ground</font>

106
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no women to keep us company.</font>

107
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's women in the ground.</font>

108
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put some there myself.</font>

109
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">So have you.</font>

110
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like fucking and drinking</font>

111
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">and singing.</font>

112
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">But killing,</font>

113
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">killing's the thing you love.</font>

114
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just like me.</font>

115
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only smaller.</font>

116
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And quicker.</font>

117
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh?</font>

118
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Lord lmp's going to miss you.</font>

119
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye...</font>

120
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect he will someday.</font>

121
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are.</font>

122
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more drink before the war?</font>

123
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we?</font>

124
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always hated the bells.</font>

125
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">They ring for horror.</font>

126
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dead king, a city under siege.</font>

127
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A wedding.
- Exactly.</font>

128
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Podrick, is that it?</font>

129
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Is that it?" Nice touch.</font>

130
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.</font>

131
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.</font>

132
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
what I'm suggesting.</font>

133
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you trust him?</font>

134
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oddly enough, I do.</font>

135
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

136
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">The map you asked for.</font>

137
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath the city.</font>

138
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Closer to 50.</font>

139
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege</font>

140
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to provide escape if necessary.</font>

141
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not escaping.</font>

142
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship,</font>

143
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if the ship goes down, I go with her.</font>

144
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is good to hear.</font>

145
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.</font>

146
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look well suited for battle, my lord.</font>

147
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm not.</font>

148
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.</font>

149
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little birds tell me</font>

150
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
with a red priestess from Asshai.</font>

151
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of it?</font>

152
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?</font>

153
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
What do you think?</font>

154
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you believe in what you see</font>

155
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in what those you trust have seen.</font>

156
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably don't entirely trust me.</font>

157
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, don't take it personally.</font>

158
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't entirely trust myself.</font>

159
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet I have seen things</font>

160
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">and heard things,</font>

161
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">things you have not, things I wish I had not.</font>

162
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.</font>

163
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't believe you have.</font>

164
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, I will.</font>

165
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dark arts have
provided Lord Stannis with his armies</font>

166
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">and paved his path to our door.</font>

167
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a man in service to such powers
to sit on the Iron Throne,</font>

168
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can think of nothing worse.</font>

169
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tonight,</font>

170
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.</font>

171
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're welcoming the new king.</font>

172
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never known bells to mean surrender.</font>

173
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to play music with us? Let's play.</font>

174
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drums.
- Drums!</font>

175
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, wait till the ships...</font>

176
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ships are in the bay.</font>

177
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They must be far enough in...
- I know what "in" means.</font>

178
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.</font>

179
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I watched my brother chopping wood.</font>

180
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you kill a man with a shield.</font>

181
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be unstoppable with an ax.</font>

182
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.</font>

183
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.</font>

184
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.</font>

185
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enhances it, really.</font>

186
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.</font>

187
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been spending time with fancy folks.</font>

188
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Sansa and Sheila.</font>

189
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shae.
- Shae, yes.</font>

190
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely my sister has asked you to join the
other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.</font>

191
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has, my lord,
but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.</font>

192
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa.</font>

193
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always been a great romantic, my nephew.</font>

194
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa, come here.</font>

195
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will pray for your safe return, my lord.</font>

196
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will you?
- Just as I pray for the king's.</font>

197
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay safe, my lady.</font>

198
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, my lion.</font>

199
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your king rides forth to battle.</font>

200
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see him off with a kiss.</font>

201
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">My new blade.</font>

202
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hearteater, I've named it.</font>

203
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kiss it.</font>

204
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll kiss it again when I return</font>

205
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">and taste my uncle's blood.</font>

206
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you slay him yourself?</font>

207
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.</font>

208
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the vanguard?</font>

209
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">A king doesn't discuss battle plans
with stupid girls.</font>

210
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.</font>

211
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you'll be in the vanguard.</font>

212
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say my brother Robb always goes
where the fighting is thickest.</font>

213
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he is only a pretender.</font>

214
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother's turn will come.</font>

215
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.</font>

216
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of those boys will never come back.</font>

217
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey will.</font>

218
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The worst ones always live.
- Shh.</font>

219
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, my lady.</font>

220
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's our fleet?</font>

221
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the way.</font>

222
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why isn't it here now? They're coming.</font>

223
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hound, tell the Hand
that his king has asked him a question.</font>

224
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king has asked you a question.</font>

225
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king
that the Hand is extremely busy.</font>

226
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hand of the King would like me
to tell you to tell the king...</font>

227
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.</font>

228
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would make me the quarterman.</font>

229
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just doesn't have the same ring to it.</font>

230
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut me in half and I won't be
able to give the signal.</font>

231
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No signal, no plan.</font>

232
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">No plan and Stannis Baratheon
sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne,</font>

233
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">puts your pinched little head
atop a gate somewhere.</font>

234
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might be quite amusing,</font>

235
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">except that my head would be up there, too.</font>

236
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never much liked my head,</font>

237
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't want to see it removed just yet.</font>

238
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are their ships?</font>

239
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.</font>

240
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.</font>

241
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no surprises here.</font>

242
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,</font>

243
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe their sailors have mutinied.</font>

244
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

245
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why she wants me here.</font>

246
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.</font>

247
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.</font>

248
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt it.</font>

249
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe she's jealous of you.</font>

250
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would she be jealous?</font>

251
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa.</font>

252
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.</font>

253
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look pale, child.</font>

254
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your red flower still blooming?</font>

255
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

256
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fitting, isn't it?</font>

257
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.</font>

258
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pour Lady Sansa some wine.</font>

259
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.</font>

260
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">So? I didn't offer you water.</font>

261
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he doing here?</font>

262
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser llyn?</font>

263
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here to defend us.</font>

264
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.</font>

265
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have guards to defend us.</font>

266
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guards we have paid.</font>

267
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones out of the doors.</font>

268
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lads caught a groom and two maids
trying to sneak away</font>

269
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a stolen horse and some gold cups.</font>

270
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle's first traitors.</font>

271
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have Ser llyn see to them.</font>

272
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put their heads on spikes
outside the stables as a warning.</font>

273
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way to keep the small folk loyal</font>

274
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.</font>

275
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.</font>

276
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said he was here to protect us.</font>

277
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is.</font>

278
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitors are a danger to us all.</font>

279
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">More wine.</font>

280
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">There they are.</font>

281
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!</font>

282
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archers!</font>

283
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nock your arrows!</font>

284
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nock arrows!</font>

285
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold fast.
- Hold fast!</font>

286
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? We need to attack them.</font>

287
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold fast.
- Boulders ready!</font>

288
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold fast!</font>

289
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?</font>

290
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the rest of them?</font>

291
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one ship.</font>

292
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archers, stand to!</font>

293
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man the below!</font>

294
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nock.
- Nock and set!</font>

295
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draw!</font>

296
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold.</font>

297
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold.</font>

298
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one on board.</font>

299
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">More rocks coming up!</font>

300
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold.</font>

301
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wildfire.</font>

302
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steer clear! Steer clear!</font>

303
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matthos! Get down!</font>

00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace.</font>

305
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dwarf has played his little trick.</font>

306
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The wildfire.
- He can only play it once.</font>

307
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're too far from the gates.</font>

308
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fire, their archers...</font>

309
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hundreds will die.</font>

310
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands.</font>

311
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me and take this city!</font>

312
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa, come here, little dove.</font>

313
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">My queen.</font>

314
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

315
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praying.</font>

316
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're perfect, aren't you?</font>

317
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praying.</font>

318
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you praying for?</font>

319
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the gods to have mercy on us all.</font>

320
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

321
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">On all of us?</font>

322
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?</font>

323
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Your Grace.</font>

324
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Joffrey?</font>

325
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.</font>

326
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.</font>

327
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.</font>

328
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father told me that
when he caught me praying.</font>

329
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother had just died, you see.</font>

330
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.</font>

331
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,</font>

332
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.</font>

333
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father doesn't believe in the gods?</font>

334
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.</font>

335
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for her.</font>

336
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

337
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

338
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

339
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like that. Drink, girl.</font>

340
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have been born a man.</font>

341
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather face a thousand swords</font>

342
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.</font>

343
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.</font>

344
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was expected of me,</font>

345
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.</font>

346
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,</font>

347
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">these hens will return to their cocks</font>

348
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">and crow of how my courage inspired them,</font>

349
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">lifted their spirits.</font>

350
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the city should fall?</font>

351
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like that, wouldn't you?</font>

352
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Red Keep should hold for a time,</font>

353
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.</font>

354
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it were anyone else outside those gates,</font>

355
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might have hoped for a private audience,</font>

356
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is Stannis Baratheon.</font>

357
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.</font>

358
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I shocked you, little dove?</font>

359
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.</font>

360
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best one's between your legs.</font>

361
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Learn how to use it. Drink.</font>

362
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?</font>

363
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you wouldn't, would you?</font>

364
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the city falls, these fine women</font>

365
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">should be in for a bit of a rape.</font>

366
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.</font>

367
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be glad of your red flower then.</font>

368
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.</font>

369
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.</font>

370
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">A slice of cake</font>

371
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">just waiting to be eaten.</font>

372
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">More pressure!</font>

373
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!</font>

374
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull! Pull!</font>

375
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.</font>

376
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming. They're coming ashore.</font>

377
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rain fire on them.</font>

378
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archers!</font>

379
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are too many.</font>

380
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop</font>

381
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">that manages to touch solid ground.</font>

382
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod, run to the King's Gate.</font>

383
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring any men guarding it here, now.</font>

384
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

385
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.</font>

386
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too.</font>

387
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of these flaming fucking arrows
come near me,</font>

388
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll strangle you with your own guts.</font>

389
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull, pull! Go!</font>

390
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,557

00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">First and second squads, to the gate!
To the Mud Gate!</font>

399
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man dies with a clean sword,</font>

400
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll rape his fucking corpse.</font>

401
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we were young, Jaime and I,</font>

402
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.</font>

403
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never understand why
they treated us differently.</font>

404
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,</font>

405
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was taught to smile</font>

406
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sing and please.</font>

407
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was heir to Casterly Rock,</font>

408
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was sold to some stranger like a horse</font>

409
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be ridden whenever he desired.</font>

410
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were Robert's queen.</font>

411
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.</font>

412
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I know this one.</font>

413
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty.</font>

414
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.</font>

415
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.</font>

416
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Straighten your back and bend.</font>

417
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better. You learn fast.</font>

418
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?</font>

419
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few weeks, Your Grace.</font>

420
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you leave Lorath?</font>

421
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.</font>

422
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she was a nobleman's daughter.</font>

423
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not.</font>

424
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you come to Westeros?</font>

425
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten years ago, Your Grace.</font>

426
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
in 10 years,</font>

427
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">all without learning how to curtsy.</font>

428
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine that's a very interesting story.</font>

429
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:09,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

430
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae, Your Grace.</font>

431
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us a story, Shae.</font>

432
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 13, I...</font>

433
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace!</font>

434
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">What news?</font>

435
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lmp has set the river afire.</font>

439
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his troops
have landed outside the city walls.</font>

440
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Joffrey?</font>

441
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.</font>

442
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back inside at once.</font>

443
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace...
- What?</font>

444
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king's presence is good for morale.</font>

445
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back to his chambers now.</font>

446
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not here?
- With the women and children?</font>

447
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
for the rest of his life?</font>

448
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, but I...
- Now!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied.</font>

450

<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to hear the truth?</font>

451
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know why he's really here?</font>

452
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here for us.</font>

453

he may take the throne,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fall back!
- Fall back!</font>

457
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the ladders up!</font>

458
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faster, you bastards! Faster!</font>

459
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, kill the scum!</font>

460
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone bring me a drink.</font>

461
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck the water. Bring me wine.</font>

462
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get you some iced milk</font>

463
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?</font>

464
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat shit, dwarf.</font>

465
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on the wrong side of the wall.</font>

466
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost half my men.</font>

467
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Blackwater's on fire.</font>

468
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dog, I command you to
go back out there and fight.</font>

469
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Kingsguard, Clegane.</font>

470
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city.</font>

471
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your king's city.</font>

472
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck the Kingsguard.</font>

473
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck the city.</font>

474
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck the king.</font>

475
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loose!</font>

476
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your backs into it!</font>

477
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, get up!</font>

478
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loose!</font>

479
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear!</font>

480
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forward!</font>

00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave!</font>

485
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace,</font>

486
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">the queen has sent me to
bring you back to the Red Keep.</font>

487
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you won't defend your own city,
why should they?</font>

488
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you have me do?</font>

489
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lead.</font>

490
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders who want to kill them.</font>

491
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?</font>

492
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did not say, Your Grace.</font>

493
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">All men to the battlements!</font>

494

00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archers, hold your line</font>

497
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll kill you myself.</font>

498
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand fast!</font>

499
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

500
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, you fool.</font>

501
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need more arrows!</font>

502
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the king?</font>

503
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:34,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why isn't he with us?
- Who are we fighting for?</font>

504
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who leads us?</font>

505
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll lead the attack.</font>

506
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll lead the attack!</font>

507
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- What are you talking about?</font>

508
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pod, my helmet.</font>

509
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner.</font>

510
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men, form up.</font>

511
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men...</font>

512
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:58,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men!</font>

513
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say I'm half a man.</font>

514
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what does that make the lot of you?</font>

515
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way out is through the gates.</font>

516
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're at the gates.</font>

517
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.</font>

518
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their arses.</font>

519
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave!</font>

520
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave!</font>

521
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fight for your king</font>

522
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">and don't fight for his kingdoms.</font>

523
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory.</font>

524
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.</font>

525
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your city Stannis means to sack.</font>

526
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your gate he's ramming.</font>

527
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,</font>

528
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">your gold he steals,</font>

529
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">your women he will rape.</font>

530
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave! Heave!</font>

531
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave!</font>

532
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are brave men knocking at our door.</font>

533
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go kill them.</font>

534
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle is lost, Your Grace.</font>

535
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis' troops are at the gates.</font>

536
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,</font>

537
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">they lost all heart.</font>

538
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is my son?</font>

539
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to escort him back to the battle.</font>

540
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I care what you want?</font>

541
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bring me...
- Now listen to me...</font>

542
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.</font>

543
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the safest place we can be.</font>

544
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.</font>

545
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">His knights have rallied behind him.</font>

546
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will save the city.</font>

547
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we sing a hymn?</font>

548
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:08,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentle mother, font of mercy</font>

549
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save our sons from war, we pray</font>

550
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must go.</font>

551
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run to your chamber and bar your door.</font>

552
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.</font>

553
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come with me.
- I need to say goodbye to someone.</font>

554
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">The queen said they'd rape everyone.</font>

555
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one is raping me.</font>

556
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Run.</font>

557
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lady is starting to panic.</font>

558
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

559
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not here for long.</font>

560
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm going.
- Where?</font>

561
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someplace that isn't burning.</font>

562
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:30,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">North, might be.</font>

563
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be.</font>

564
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the king?</font>

565
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can die just fine on his own.</font>

566
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can take you with me.</font>

567
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take you to Winterfell.</font>

568
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll keep you safe.</font>

569
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to go home?</font>

570
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be safe here.</font>

571
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis won't hurt me.</font>

572
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

573
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis is a killer.</font>

574
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lannisters are killers.</font>

575
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father was a killer.</font>

576
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother is a killer.</font>

577
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sons will be killers someday.</font>

578
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is built by killers.</font>

579
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'd better get used to looking at them.</font>

580
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't hurt me.</font>

581
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, little bird, I won't hurt you.</font>

582
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heave!</font>

583
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!</font>

584
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attack!</font>

585
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll it over!</font>

586
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half man! Half man! Half man!</font>

587
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck me.</font>

588
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

589
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be calm, my sweet.</font>

590
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're still fighting.</font>

591
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's going to hurt you.</font>

592
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you a story.</font>

593
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the one about
the mother lion and her little cub?</font>

594
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood?</font>

595
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my love.</font>

596
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Kingswood,
there lived a mother and her cub.</font>

597
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">She loved him very much.</font>

598
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there were other things
that lived in the woods. Evil things.</font>

599
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

600
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like stags.</font>

601
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stags aren't evil.</font>

602
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">They only eat grass.</font>

603
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wolves.</font>

604
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

605
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could hear them
howling in the night.</font>

606
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little cub was frightened.</font>

607
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.</font>

608
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.</font>

609
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You will be king.</font>

610
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.</font>

611
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,</font>

612
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">"all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea,</font>

613
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">"they will all come to you, little lion,</font>

614
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">"to rest a crown upon your head."</font>

615
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the cub said,</font>

616
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"</font>

617
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Yes," said his mother.</font>

618
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."</font>

619
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will keep you safe, my love.</font>

620
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise you.</font>

621
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the boats!</font>

622
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand and fight!</font>

623
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand and fight, damn you!</font>

624
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

625
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

626
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle is over. We have won.</font>

627
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:11,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And who are you,"
the proud lord said</font>

628
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That I must bow so low?"</font>

629
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:21,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Only a cat of a different coat</font>

630
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That's all the truth I know</font>

631
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">"In a coat of gold or a coat of red</font>

632
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:37,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A lion still has claws</font>

633
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:42,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And mine are long and sharp, my lord</font>

634
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">"As long and sharp as yours"</font>

635
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:54,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so he spoke, and so he spoke</font>

636
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:59,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Lord of Castamere</font>

637
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:04,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now the rains weep o'er his hall</font>

638
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:09,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">With no one there to hear</font>

639
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:15,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall</font>

640
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not a soul to hear</font>
