- It's okay, Allie.</font>

149
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
sometimes that's what people do.</font>

150
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.</font>

151
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what? In the end,</font>

152
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're the ones who change the world.</font>

153
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take good care of that, Allie.</font>

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.</font>

155
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Say hi.
- Hi.</font>

156
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, kids.</font>

157
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to interrupt,</font>

158
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's time to get changed
for your interview.</font>

159
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Kids, sorry to leave you.</font>

160
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.</font>

161
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's question,
and any others.</font>

162
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!</font>

163
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,571
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What do you say, Mr. Drake,</i></font>

164
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">we just start at the beginning?</font>

165
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Born to British parents.</font>

166
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then at 19,
you discovered a gene therapy</font>

167
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">that literally doubles
the life expectancy</font>

168
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,</font>

169
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">it tripled their life expectancy.</font>

170
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's okay.</font>

171
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, 24. That's still extremely young.</font>

172
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you create</font>

173
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.</font>

174
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then... Rockets.</font>

175
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You then decide,
like any normal human being,</font>

176
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're gonna go and explore space.</font>

177
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what it is?
I have always believed</font>

178
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">that space exploration
is crucial in our quest to cure</font>

179
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything that ails us here on Earth.</font>

180
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you think about
everything we've found</font>

181
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the oceans and on land,</font>

182
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't it time to look up there?</font>

183
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">To this plethora of untapped resources?</font>

184
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,</font>

185
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">from your pharmaceutical companies</font>

186
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize</font>

187
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.</font>

188
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Full circle.</font>

189
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I have to ask, how does that work,</font>

190
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?</font>

191
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it... How does it...</font>

192
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, how does it go about,</font>

193
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking</font>

194
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.</font>

195
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking about the allegations.</font>

196
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that</font>

197
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">your entire empire has been built</font>

198
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.</font>

199
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true, right?
It says that you recruit</font>

200
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests</font>

201
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">that more often than not
end up killing people.</font>

202
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm aware of these rumors online.</font>

203
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.</font>

204
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. What about the legal cases?</font>

205
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry?</font>

206
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">The actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,</font>

207
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.</font>

208
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.</font>

209
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're just some
of the people who walked</font>

210
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.</font>

211
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.</font>

212
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...</font>

213
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:36,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...</font>

214
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.</font>

215
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.</font>

216
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.</font>

217
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a threat?</font>

218
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice life.</font>

219
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you're going to say, but...</font>

220
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy, he is all the way bad, Jack.</font>

221
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you just give...
- Who's your source?</font>

222
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?</font>

223
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.</font>

224
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't the Wild Wild West.</font>

225
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.</font>

226
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do the work.</font>

227
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We substantiate our accusations.</font>

228
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">We provide evidence.</font>

229
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumb-ass.</font>

230
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fired, Eddie.</font>

231
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't trust you.</font>

232
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice life.</font>

233
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will just take a second.
- Okay.</font>

234
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

235
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are pathologically self-absorbed.</font>

236
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie. Annie, can you talk to me first?
- Your ego requires constant attention,</font>

237
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're stubborn as hell.</font>

238
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was willing to roll with it,
Eddie, because I loved you.</font>

239
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?</font>

240
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you did got me fired.</font>

241
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used me.</font>

242
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie? Annie.</font>

243
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

244
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're beautiful.</font>

245
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Test 36.</font>

246
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:47,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biological interactions between
two different organisms.</font>

247
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host</font>

248
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to survive
for any amount of time</font>

249
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">in an oxygen-rich environment.</font>

250
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why are all these hosts</font>

251
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">showing this hyper-acute rejection?</font>

252
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we're trying to find out.</font>

253
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bonding process is starting.</font>

254
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's equalizing.</font>

255
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why? Why this rabbit?</font>

256
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:21,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's similar to an organ transplant.</font>

257
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?</font>

258
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.</font>

259
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we do achieve symbiosis,
they should be able to survive here,</font>

260
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">but also we would
be able to survive there.</font>

261
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We"?</font>

262
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Begin human trials.
- It's way too soon</font>

263
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">to even begin to think
about something like...</font>

264
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.</font>

265
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?</font>

266
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand,
but it's an ethical question.</font>

267
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.</font>

268
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how are your kids?</font>

269
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin human trials.</font>

270
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good work.</font>

271
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jack.</font>

272
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ever feel like your life
is like one monumental screwup?</font>

273
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nope.
<i>- Here at the Life Foundation,</i></font>

274
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?</font>

278
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,373

like, switch him off?</font>

279
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people are trying to watch that.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You are, are you?</font>

281
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?</font>

282
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,517

287
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not want you
to spend it all at once.</font>

288
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go home
and chase myself around the room,</font>

- Righteous, Eddie.</font>

292

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,</font>

296
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">got the papers out
and brought 'em back over here,</font>

297
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.</font>

298
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You did that for me?
- Yes, I did.</font>

299
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.</font>

300
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what,
you give me a dollar for a song,</font>

301
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll throw in the paper.</font>

302
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,</font>

303
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not to sing, all right?</font>

304
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal.</font>

305
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

306
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You're welcome.</font>

307
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mrs. Chen.</font>

308
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How you doing, Eddie?
- Aches and pains,</font>

309
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, aches and pains.</font>

310
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like shit.</font>

311
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

312
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like shit.</font>

313
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you look as beautiful as ever.</font>

314
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.</font>

315
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been meditating
like I showed you?</font>

316
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,</font>

317
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,</font>

318
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I bought a DVD off your cousin,
and it was in Mandarin.</font>

319
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't understand that, either.</font>

320
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, that right there,
I don't understand what you just said.</font>

321
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the problem.</font>

322
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.</font>

323
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

324
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

325
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the price goes up
for my protection.</font>

326
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">The full payment is due.</font>

327
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

328
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure you have my money ready, Chen.</font>

329
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like to wait.</font>

330
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life hurts, Eddie.</font>

331
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just does.</font>

332
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go.</font>

333
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not even asking to staff there.</font>

344
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.</font>

345
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can use a pseudonym.</font>

346
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any name. Think... You pick a name.</font>

347
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i></font>

349
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need.</font>

368
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isaac. You know that's a biblical name?</font>

369
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,532
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, sir.</i></font>

382
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,224

his end of the bargain, Isaac,</font>

383

What are you doing here?</font>

636
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,668

I'm gonna call the police.</font>

I'm a doctor. This man is my...</font>

- Yes, he is. He is!</font>

648
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have proof!</font>

649
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,929

660
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's gonna be completely painless.</i></font>

661
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:38,528
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So, you know, just try to stay still.</i></font>

662
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,675

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, here we go.</i></font>

664
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie, what's happening in there?</font>

665
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:51,594

00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:02,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're okay. Yeah.</font>

669
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming out. You all right?</font>

670
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:05,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.</font>

671
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

672
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Just take a deep breath.
Okay? You're okay.</font>

673
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:10,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

677
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy. Hey, Mrs. Manfredi.
How are you?</font>

678
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just saw Morris.</font>

679
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.</font>

680
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good.
- Thank you so much.</font>

681
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, my pleasure.</font>

682
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.</font>

683
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.</font>

684
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Gemini.</font>

685
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.</font>

686
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for now, go home, get some rest.
I'll call you when your tests are in.</font>

687
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:38,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.</font>

688
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.</font>

689
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.</font>

690
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have the same reactions
regardless of the temperature...</font>

691
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good afternoon, Dr. Skirth.</font>

692
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The creature and the host are one.</font>

693
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything was fine.</font>

694
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, why does the human
continue to waste away?</font>

695
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.</font>

696
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:07,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the organism is unaffected?</font>

697
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.</font>

698
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">But once again, it's killing the host.</font>

699
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's consuming his organs.</font>

700
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch this.</font>

701
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!</font>

702
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.</font>

703
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.</font>

704
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was stabilizing. What happened?</font>

705
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:33,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's approaching acute liver failure.</font>

706
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need another host.</font>

707
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such poor design.</font>

708
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:40,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- Human beings.</font>

709
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to interrupt.</font>

710
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you'd like some good news.</font>

711
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

712
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,766
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hungry!</i></font>

713
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn.</font>

714
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay. Don't worry about me.</font>

715
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get through, please? Excuse me.</font>

716
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

717
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna stay here, all right?</font>

718
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the cable car stops.</font>

719
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're good. All right. Thank you.</font>

720
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:21,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

721
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Anne.</font>

722
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie, hi. How you feeling?</font>

723
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feeling... I'm sick.</font>

724
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Eddie, you have a parasite.</font>

725
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not exactly sure how you got it,</font>

726
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it would explain the fever.</font>

727
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,773
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That would make sense.</i></font>

728
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I'm hearing a voice.</font>

729

731
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,967
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I didn't realize

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dan, would this parasite...</font>

734
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it, like, be able to make me,
I don't know...</font>

735
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:59,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,</font>

736
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,208

737
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,911
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes. We just did.</i></font>

738
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,065

I'm not actually talking to you, Annie.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all been troubled.</font>

762
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,032

763
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.</font>

764

807
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,835

I'm just seeing things.</font>

817

behind the Schueller Building.</font>

822

824
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? What is that?</font>

825
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

826
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,253

<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Don't do that!</font>

1047
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.</font>

1048

1049
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were killing me?</font>

1050
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?</font>

1051
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.</font>

1052
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:45,186

a little problem on our hands?</font>

1055
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.</font>

1056
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,140

what the hell's going on?</font>

1057
01:12:58,164 --> 01:13:01,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,</font>

1058
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,252

But, Dan, I promise,</font>

That wouldn't be any fun.</font>

Go. Go!</font>

- I don't know.</font>

1072

I wouldn't tell you anyway.</font>

- Sorry.</font>

1075

<font color="#FFFFFF">Long journal entry about that tonight.</font>

1076
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.</font>

1077

<font color="#FFFFFF">What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.</font>

1078
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:12,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.</font>

1079

<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't go on.</font>

1080

<font color="#FFFFFF">We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.</font>

1081

1082

<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it. All you do is take.</font>

1083
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:24,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took my Symbiote.
You take potshots at a great man</font>

- Who?</font>

1085

you loved the most,</font>

1086
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">who trusted you the most? That's insane.</font>

1087
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:36,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I've initiated
is a whole new world, a new species.</font>

1088

1089
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.</font>

1090
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:45,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I have spent
a significant amount of time, all right,</font>

1091
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:48,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">with one of these creatures up my ass.</font>

1092
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a lot of fun.</font>

1093
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:54,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I find out, all along,
that they're killing you.</font>

1094
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:55,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the last time I'm asking you.</font>

1095
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.</font>

1096

- Oh, my God!</font>

1097
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:02,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Venom?</font>

1098
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:06,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the ugliest-looking thing
I have ever seen.</font>

1099
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Brock, I have no use for you.</font>

1100
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Treece! Come and clean up your mess.</font>

1101
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has one up his ass, too.</font>

1102
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:35,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.</font>

1103
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:39,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are more of us. Millions more.</font>

1104
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will follow wherever I lead.</font>

1105
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we lead.</font>

1106
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, "we."</font>

1107
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, we must retrieve them.</font>

1108
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can take care of that.</font>

1109
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?</font>

1110
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

1111
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so tough without your friend.</font>

1112
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your mama not love you?</font>

1113
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

1114
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it pays to be a specialist, huh?</font>

1115
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,</font>

1116
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">because there's something
way bigger afoot</font>

1117

<font color="#FFFFFF">in this world than you and me.</font>

1118
01:17:30,311 --> 01:17:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much bigger than me.</font>

1119
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:36,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's much, much bigger than you.</font>

1120
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:40,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karma's a bitch.</font>

1121
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe in karma.</font>

1122

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Eddie.</font>

1123
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:17,481

1124
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,900

I've been there, too. It's not fun.</font>

a team leader.</i></font>

1131
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,667

01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,726

1180
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,197
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Holy shit!</i>

1181

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>T-minus three minutes.</i></font>

1182
01:22:07,588 --> 01:22:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a strong host.</font>

1183
01:22:11,342 --> 01:22:12,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not strong enough.</font>

1184

1187
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:11,961

1188
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:21,630
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>T-minus one minute.</i></font>

1189
01:24:39,615 --> 01:24:40,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too late.</font>

1190
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the next stage...</font>

1191
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:46,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk too much.</font>

1192
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,998
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i></font>

1193
01:24:58,092 --> 01:24:59,880

1209
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:21,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.</font>

1210
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how you feeling after all that?</font>

1211
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel great. Awesome.</font>

1212
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?</font>

1213
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in luck.
I've decided to work pro bono.</font>

1214
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:35,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm joining
the public defenders' office.</font>

1215
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good person, Annie.</font>

1216
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:38,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you? What are you gonna do?</font>

1217
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">The network asked me
to bring the show back,</font>

1218
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.</font>

1219
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:44,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? So, what did you say?</font>

1220
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:49,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.</font>

1221
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:51,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I scored the interview of a lifetime.</font>

1222
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.</font>

1223
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like everyone else.</font>

1224
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1225
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:02,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.</font>

1226
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey...</font>

1227
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to talk about that kiss?</font>

1228
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:12,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">That? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...</font>

1229
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:17,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was your buddy's idea.</font>

1230
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:20,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Well, that is good to know.</font>

1231
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?</font>

1232
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:27,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the...</font>

1233
01:28:27,301 --> 01:28:30,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...</font>

1234
01:28:31,096 --> 01:28:32,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.</font>

1235
01:28:32,556 --> 01:28:33,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1236
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Eddie?</font>

1237
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?</font>

1238
01:28:38,854 --> 01:28:42,019
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Look at her. She has no idea
we are going to get her back.</i></font>

1239
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:45,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think so.</font>

1240
01:28:45,444 --> 01:28:47,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.</font>

1241
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?</font>

1242
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i></font>

1243
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie, are you sure?</font>

1244
01:28:54,787 --> 01:28:57,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord, look at that.
Look at the time. I have to go.</font>

1245
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.</font>

1246
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take care, all right?</font>

1247
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:06,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.</font>

1248
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Don't give up on her.</font>

1249
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either of you.</font>

1250
01:29:15,432 --> 01:29:16,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't.</font>

1251
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,932
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.</font>

1252
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,136
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wait. This thing looks delicious.</i></font>

1253
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:23,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,</font>

1254
01:29:23,774 --> 01:29:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?</font>

1255
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:30,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot just go around
eating anybody that you want to.</font>

1256
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,314
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.</font>

1257
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.</font>

1258
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.</font>

1259
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then there are bad people.</font>

1260
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to tell the difference.</font>

1261
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:45,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">The deal is, you will only ever
be allowed to touch,</font>

1262
01:29:45,796 --> 01:29:49,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">harm, hurt, possibly, very possibly,</font>

1263
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">eat very, very bad people,</font>

1264
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">but never, ever, ever good people.
All right?</font>

1265
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,467
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.</font>

1266
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But how does one tell the difference?</i></font>

1267
01:29:58,601 --> 01:29:59,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's super simple.</font>

1268
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you just have to...
You can intuit it, you can sense it.</font>

1269
01:30:03,606 --> 01:30:05,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes you can even feel it.</font>

1270
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,024
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Whatever you say.</i></font>

1271
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:08,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But can we get something to eat now?</i></font>

1272
01:30:08,944 --> 01:30:14,064
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i></font>

1273
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.</font>

1274
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mrs. C.</font>

1275
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, Eddie?</font>

1276
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:25,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.</font>

1277
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1278
01:30:28,213 --> 01:30:31,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what culinary delights
will tickle the pickle tonight?</font>

1279
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,167
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tater tots and chocolate.</i></font>

1280
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Okay, no problem.</font>

1281
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">The payment's due, Chen.</font>

1282
01:30:39,266 --> 01:30:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please. I can't keep doing this.
- Now.</font>

1283
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,435
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.</font>

1284
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">You come in here again...</font>

1285
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:58,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, you go anywhere in this city,
preying on innocent people,</font>

1286
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:02,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we will find you
and eat both your arms</font>

1287
01:31:02,164 --> 01:31:03,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.</font>

1288
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we will eat your face
right off your head. Do you understand?</font>

1289
01:31:07,252 --> 01:31:08,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please...
- Yes.</font>

1290
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:12,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you will be this armless, legless,
faceless thing, won't you,</font>

1291
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:17,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?</font>

1292
01:31:17,721 --> 01:31:20,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?</font>

1293
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are Venom.</font>

1294
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On second thought...
- Please.</font>

1295
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:37,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eddie? What was that?</font>

1296
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:42,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.</font>

1297
01:31:44,289 --> 01:31:45,622
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.</font>

1298
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a term of endearment, that's all.</font>

1299
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,622
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.</font>

1300
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:52,546
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.</font>

1301
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:55,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
So, what do you want to do now?</font>

1302
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:59,261
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i></font>

1303
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to stay quiet.</font>

1304
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:31,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.</font>

1305
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i></font>

1306
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:40,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open on five.</font>

1307
01:34:42,926 --> 01:34:43,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Opening up.</font>

1308
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:48,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.</font>

1309
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second he asked
for you to interview him,</font>

1310
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have shut that shit down.</font>

1311
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage</font>

1312
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:57,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.</font>

1313
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.</font>

1314
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:04,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">FBI don't work
up close and personal with him.</font>

1315
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:08,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.</font>

1316
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Red! I got a visitor for you.</font>

1317
01:35:34,436 --> 01:35:36,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.</font>

1318
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?</font>

1319
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:42,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, it's good with me.</font>

1320
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can turn it on if you want.</font>

1321
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:51,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can talk about the Dadaist patterns
of arterial spray.</font>

1322
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you can.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But... I'm sorry.</font>

1333
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:41,216

1343
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, kid. Drop the body.</font>

1344
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:35,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody stop that train!</font>

1345
01:49:58,509 --> 01:49:59,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i></font>

1348
01:50:13,981 --> 01:50:15,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you?

1349
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:18,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you trying to kill me?

<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Thanks, New York.</font>
