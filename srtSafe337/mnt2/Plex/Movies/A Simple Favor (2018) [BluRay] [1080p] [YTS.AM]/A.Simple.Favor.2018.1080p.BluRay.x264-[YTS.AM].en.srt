15
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">which was five days ago</font>

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she hasn't
come back yet, so...</font>

17
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
We're all really worried.</font>

18
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm doing everything I can</font>

19
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help the police
track her down.</font>

20
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm realizing I don't know
her as well as I thought I did.</font>

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like my mom used to say,</font>

22
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">God rest her soul, um,</font>

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Secrets are like margarine,</font>

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">"easy to spread,
bad for the heart."</font>

25
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as different as we are,</font>

26
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do consider Emily
my best friend.</font>

27
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is this wonderful,
elegant person.</font>

28
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">And our sons
brought us together, actually.</font>

for our new friends,</i></font>

30

from the beginning.</i></font>

31
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,971
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I met Emily
a few weeks ago at school.</i></font>

00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,597
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was
International Cuisine Day</i></font>

33

00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,183
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And once again, I drew Sweden,</i></font>

35
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,937

meatless meatballs.</i></font>

36
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all dead!
I killed everyone!</font>

37
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me. I came back to life.</font>

38
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:15,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to thank everyone who
participated in today's feast.</font>

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!</font>

40
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Class, haven't we
learned so much</font>

41
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">about food
from all around the world?</font>

42
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give your parents
a big round of applause.</font>

44
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks great!</font>

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Big smile!
- Oh, my gosh.</font>

46
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where does she get
all that energy from?</font>

47
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at?</font>

48
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's crystal meth
in those meatballs.</font>

49
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, parents, there's
a sign-up sheet on the board</font>

50
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">for our Fun Fair next week.</font>

51
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:40,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, please, Stephanie, don't
sign up for more than one job.</font>

52
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure everyone else
has had a chance to volunteer.</font>

53
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miles, sweetie, sweetie,
maybe just be careful</font>

54
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your fingers
with Nicky's truck, okay?</font>

55
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Has Nicky's mom volunteered?
- Emily? Please.</font>

56
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wouldn't know a sign-up
sheet if it bit her on the ass.</font>

57
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it'd be my dream
to run PR for Dennis Nylon.</font>

58
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you imagine all
the free shit she must get?</font>

59
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- Okay.</font>

60
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm crossing myself
off decorations.</font>

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can leave that open for Emily,
then if she can't make it,</font>

62
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can still bring
my balloons and helium tank.</font>

63
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please tell me you don't
actually own a helium tank.</font>

64
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think lots of people
own helium tanks, Stacy,</font>

65
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause kids love balloons.</font>

66
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you not have one?
You a bad parent?</font>

67
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kidding.</font>

68
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're terrible parents.</font>

69
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's a perfect
plan, Stephanie.</font>

70
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good thinking, Stephanie.</font>

71
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Smooch!</font>

72
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great work
today, Smooch.</font>

73
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smooch?</font>

74
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks a lot, Mom.
- Oh.</font>

75
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can me and Miles
have a play date today?</font>

76
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I don't know, sweetie.</font>

77
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need
to ask your mommy</font>

78
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's still in the city.</font>

79
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:42,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right there.</font>

80
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here, little dude.</font>

81
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my baby!</font>

82
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at your shirt. Did any
food make it into your mouth?</font>

83
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask her, Nicky! Ask her!</font>

84
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ask me what?
- We want a play date.</font>

85
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we can't, Mommy
already has a play date</font>

86
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a symphony
of anti-depressants.</font>

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- Play date! Play date!</font>

88
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Play date!
- Baby, please don't do this.</font>

89
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go. Come on.
I got a ton of work to do.</font>

90
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't let me have any fun.
- That's not true.</font>

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let you tear my labia</font>

92
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">as you exited my body,
so you're welcome.</font>

93
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you drink? I need a martini.</font>

94
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Uh... Yeah. I like martinis.</font>

95
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had one in a long
time. They're good, though.</font>

96
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had one that was, like,
mostly chocolate</font>

97
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was like,
"Alcohol and chocolate?</font>

98
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:51,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, mom life!"</font>

99
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. No play date.
Come on, kid, let's go.</font>

100
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:59,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then I'm staying here.
- Christ, he's fucking stubborn.</font>

101
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't have to have
the chocolate in it, like...</font>

102
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I don't think
I'm gonna win this, so, um...</font>

103
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, do you wanna come over
for a beverage of any kind?</font>

104
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I could use some backup.</font>

105
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's me? I'm backup?</font>

106
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does your kid drink, maybe?</font>

107
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's never too early
to start teaching them.</font>

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're joking,
but great.</font>

109
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sweetie...
- Hey, you, let's go.</font>

110
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get your
umbrella out, okay?</font>

111
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we're gonna
go out in the rain.</font>

112
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">What on Earth are
those two gonna talk about?</font>

113
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily's gonna eat
poor Stephanie alive.</font>

114
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least she'd
be eating something.</font>

115
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your problem?</font>

116
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go show him
your room. Go.</font>

117
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please don't run!</font>

118
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be safe please!</font>

119
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:50,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cute socks.</font>

120
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks!</font>

121
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're from Target.
It's 10 bucks a pack.</font>

122
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's so great, Target.
- Yeah.</font>

123
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have other animals.</font>

124
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have these
squirrel ones that are cute,</font>

125
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:02,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">they have chipmunks, beavers...</font>

126
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so... lifelike.</font>

127
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Do you like it?</font>

128
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you not?
It's, um...</font>

129
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

130
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I used to dye my hair.
I get bored easily.</font>

131
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:16,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Um...</font>

132
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you paint that?
- No. No, no.</font>

133
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's made by an
almost-famous painter.</font>

134
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the East Village.</font>

135
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life is littered
with almost-somebodies.</font>

136
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did some art modeling
in school</font>

137
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pay my way through.</font>

138
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the pervert
got obsessed with me.</font>

139
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well,
that happens, yeah.</font>

140
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I stole the painting,
you know,</font>

141
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinking it'd be worth
something someday.</font>

142
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no.
No such luck.</font>

143
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">This house is incredible.</font>

144
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
It's a fucking money pit.</font>

145
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oopsy.
- Hmm?</font>

146
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry, it's, um,</font>

147
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we say at my house
when someone swears.</font>

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a force of habit.</font>

149
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:54,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an... an 'oopsy' jar
in the pantry.</font>

150
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like, you know, put
a quarter in for every bad word.</font>

151
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should smash
the 'oopsy' jar.</font>

152
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It might change your life.
- Yeah. Ugh! Sorry.</font>

153
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say sorry.
You don't need to do that.</font>

154
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to apologize.
It's a fucked-up female habit.</font>

155
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to be sorry
for anything, ever.</font>

156
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's... that's true.
That's great advice.</font>

157
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

158
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love this music,
by the way.</font>

159
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Yeah.</font>

160
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes me forget
I'm stuck in this shithole.</font>

161
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna go get booze.
- Great!</font>

162
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was really caught up
in the ambiance.</font>

163
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
give me a little more.</font>

164
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

165
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I liked it.
I may join you later.</font>

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! You must love cooking
in this kitchen.</font>

167
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not really. Sean does.</font>

168
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's probably just
an excuse to avoid writing.</font>

169
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your husband's a writer?
- No.</font>

170
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wrote a book 10 years ago.</font>

171
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made him
the toast of the town.</font>

172
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually had to stalk him to
make him fall in love with me.</font>

173
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then nothing. He never
wrote anything ever again.</font>

174
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the old bait-and-switch.
- What was the book?</font>

175
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called
'Darkness at Dawn'.</font>

176
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh! I read that
in my book club.</font>

177
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- This was... Yeah.</font>

178
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was back when
I first became a single mom.</font>

179
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I joined this book club and
that was the first book we read.</font>

180
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... Oh, it's so impressive.</font>

181
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're divorced, then?</font>

182
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Widowed.</font>

183
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind if I ask
how he died?</font>

184
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Car accident.</font>

185
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. How awful.
- Yeah.</font>

186
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother Chris was in
the passenger seat, so...</font>

187
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kidding.</font>

188
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">One fell swoop, and the two</font>

189
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">most important men
in my life were gone.</font>

190
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Normally, sad stories
don't get to me.</font>

191
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that one... that one did.
That was brutal.</font>

192
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't talk about it a lot,</font>

193
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially with people
I just met.</font>

194
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really sorry.
Oh! Mmm...</font>

195
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, if you
apologize again,</font>

196
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to slap
the sorry out of you.</font>

197
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. That's...
I'm not sorry.</font>

198
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a hard habit
to break, though.</font>

199
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

200
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, are you dating anyone?</font>

201
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Slim pickings in Warfield.</font>

202
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are an hour
and a half outside the city.</font>

203
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna date someone
from the city.</font>

204
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried eHarmony for a while,</font>

205
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then that
mother of three wound up</font>

206
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">with her head
in the trash can.</font>

207
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember that?
And I... Ugh.</font>

208
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "No thank you. Delete."</font>

209
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

210
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, baby.
You're too sexy to give up.</font>

211
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.
I don't know. Um...</font>

212
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your head's gonna
end up in a trash can,</font>

213
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">your head's gonna end up
in a trash can.</font>

214
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't think I would
end up a single mom,</font>

215
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">struggling to make ends meet.</font>

216
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, my husband
had life insurance,</font>

217
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">thank goodness, but not a lot.</font>

218
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put half of that away
for Miles' college,</font>

219
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so, with that coming in,</font>

220
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">the money still
runs out in 2020.</font>

221
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank God for life insurance.
- Yeah.</font>

222
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband doesn't have anything
if it makes you feel better,</font>

223
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he does spend like
he's the man of the hour.</font>

224
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking have to pay
for everything.</font>

225
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:19,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't even sell this house.</font>

226
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We bought it during
the bubble and...</font>

227
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love your house.</font>

228
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't dream of selling it.</font>

229
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you, I'd just...</font>

230
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd just bask in this kitchen
all day long.</font>

231
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you should move in.</font>

232
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Cheers
to being house poor.</font>

233
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, cheers!</font>

234
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm... What?</font>

235
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, uh...</font>

236
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just another one
of my bad decisions.</font>

237
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
It's great.</font>

238
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a charity symbol?</font>

239
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:52,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are,
like, the same person, so...</font>

240
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a nice contrast
with your ring.</font>

241
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Yeah, this is
a family heirloom.</font>

242
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">It belonged to Sean's
great-grandmom and then his mom</font>

243
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she insisted that
I have it, so, you know...</font>

244
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose Subaru
is blocking the garage?</font>

245
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Speak of the devil.
- Oh, that's mine.</font>

246
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry...
- You're what?</font>

247
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm!</font>

248
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wife is trying to get me
to stop apologizing.</font>

249
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you can
get her to start.</font>

250
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

251
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

252
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

253
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, martini time?</font>

254
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sure it's 5:00 somewhere.
- Oh, my God.</font>

255
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just come up
with that cliche by yourself?</font>

256
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's such a brilliant writer.
- I have to say, you inspire me.</font>

257
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not enough, apparently.</font>

258
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why, thank you very much
for going to the grocery store,"</font>

259
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">he said, dripping with sarcasm.</font>

260
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I figured you'd want a break
from not writing ever.</font>

261
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah!</font>

262
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">With that fatal blow,
she won the joust.</font>

263
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well played.
- Thank you.</font>

264
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is Stephanie.
- Hi, Stephanie.</font>

265
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her kid goes to Warfield
with our kid.</font>

266
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">She read your book.</font>

267
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did. I loved it!</font>

268
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">It reminded me
of William Thackeray.</font>

269
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She really read it.
- Wow.</font>

270
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not many people trot out
Thackeray as a reference.</font>

271
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I was an English
major at Barnard.</font>

272
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was pre-mommy brain.</font>

273
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did my thesis
on 'The Canterbury Tales'.</font>

274
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And with that word
Arcite gan espye,</font>

275
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">"whereas this lady
roamed to and fro."</font>

276
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And with that sight,
her beauty hurt him so."</font>

277
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, do you guys
wanna get a room?</font>

278
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I breaking this up?</font>

279
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that.</font>

280
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, do you want me
to make you a drink?</font>

281
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm good.
You guys enjoy.</font>

282
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna head upstairs
for a shower.</font>

283
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

284
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you, Sharon.</font>

285
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:26,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y... yeah. It's lovely
to meet you.</font>

286
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's terrible with names.</font>

287
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. I mean,
Stephanie's crazy.</font>

288
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, P-H? What?</font>

289
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are
such a cute couple.</font>

290
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're on the verge
of bankruptcy,</font>

291
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can't find
a decent nanny</font>

292
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">in all of Connecticut, so...</font>

293
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drowning.</font>

to pick up Nicky</font>

I'm happy to help.</font>

You're the best.</i></font>

316
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:42,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Um, just does Nicky
have any dietary restrictions?</font>

317
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,552
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, just don't feed him
shit he doesn't like. Thanks.</i></font>

00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, Dennis,
this is what's gonna happen.</font>

322

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna do my job,
you're gonna take some pills,</font>

call you later, okay?</font>

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Oh, oh, I can't hear you!
I'm in an elevator.</font>

It's really silly.</font>

328
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, his dad
was much better</font>

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the roughhousing stuff.</font>

330

- Do what?</font>

331
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't denigrate
your good parenting</font>

no, Emily, that's...</font>

334
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not
what I was doing at all.</font>

335

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think you're a super mom.
- Oh, no, you don't.</font>

336
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, your kid had</font>

337
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">lobster bisque for lunch
the other day.</font>

338
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lucky if I remember
my kid's lunch box.</font>

339
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, it's fine.</font>

340
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nicest thing I could do for
Nicky is blow my brains out.</font>

341
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kidding.</font>

342
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Yeah. Well...</font>

343
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do work in the city, so...</font>

344
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!</font>

345
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just
take my picture?</font>

346
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm yearbook mom.</font>

347
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I ask you
to take my picture?</font>

348
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Erase it.
- Oh, you look really chic.</font>

349
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just for
"Faces and Places."</font>

350
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just for the other parents.</font>

351
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erase it or I'll slap a fucking
injunction on your yearbook.</font>

352
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you understand?
- Yeah. Okay.</font>

353
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's gone.</font>

354
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Bye-bye.</font>

355
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do that again.</font>

356
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.</font>

357
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I didn't mean
to offend you.</font>

358
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I'm sure that stuff's really
sensitive in your industry.</font>

359
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. It's all good.</font>

360
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm probably not
the kind of person</font>

361
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're normally friends with.</font>

362
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you do not wanna be
friends with me. Trust me.</font>

363
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis, sweetie,
let's try this again. Um...</font>

364
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I want you to go home
and chill the fuck out</font>

365
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">and don't ever call me
again. Bye.</font>

366
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how
you talk to your boss?</font>

367
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You know,
you gotta go right at 'em.</font>

368
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially the powerful ones</font>

369
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">or they will fuck you
in the face.</font>

370
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I get that.</font>

371
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna get out of here?
Mommy needs a drink.</font>

372
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Totally.</font>

373
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky!</font>

374
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, guys,</font>

375
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we're going.</font>

376
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Nicky, come! Now!</font>

377
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I have a gift for you.</font>

378
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please close your eyes.
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

379
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Hold out your
tattooed hand, please.</font>

380
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is happening.
I'll wait all day.</font>

381
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you propositioning me?
- Yes.</font>

382
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. I made that for you.</font>

383
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made this for me?</font>

384
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought it would go with that
pinstriped suit you have.</font>

385
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? That... that's nice.</font>

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one does stuff
like this for me.</font>

387
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to watch those
'Bewitched' reruns on TV Land,</font>

388
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I always thought
it was so classy</font>

389
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Darrin
would come from work</font>

390
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:30,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Samantha
would fix him a martini.</font>

391
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">So every time we do this,
I feel so high-tone.</font>

392
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, you're such a nerd.</font>

393
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Fuck this.
I need a real martini.</font>

394
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This one's not real?
- Nope.</font>

395
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sean and I had the real thing
at Dukes in London.</font>

396
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key - frozen gin.</font>

397
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a frozen glass. Here.</font>

398
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, bad martini!</font>

399
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

400
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little bit of vermouth.</font>

401
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swirl it around, dump.</font>

402
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you dare
touch that wash cloth.</font>

403
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then add in the gin.</font>

404
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

405
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut your twist.</font>

406
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squeeze it, out side out.
Get a nice little mist.</font>

407
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lick the edges. Voila.</font>

408
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't add
fucking ice. Ever.</font>

409
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't like ice anymore?</font>

410
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">That shit ruins everything.</font>

411
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tough day at work?</font>

412
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to hit
the reset button sometimes.</font>

413
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, cheers.</font>

414
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers.</font>

415
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you make me
one of those?</font>

416
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I look reset?</font>

417
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I feel reset.</font>

418
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smell good.</font>

419
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that perfume?
You smell so good.</font>

420
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wish I smelled like you.
- Thank you.</font>

421
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one of Dennis'.
I could get you one.</font>

422
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could get you a bathtub full,
if you'd like.</font>

423
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:56,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would
love... love it, girlfriend.</font>

424
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

425
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really unhappy with myself
for taking that picture...</font>

426
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, are you
still talking about that?</font>

427
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was so rude.
- Honestly, please.</font>

428
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, stop. Forget about it.
- Just like, "Ooh, paparazzo."</font>

429
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so nice. I have no idea
how you've survived this long.</font>

430
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not as nice
as you think, so...</font>

431
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you baiting me?</font>

432
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I'm just saying.</font>

433
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everybody has a dark side.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

434
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us are better
at hiding it than others.</font>

435
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna trade confessions?</font>

436
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no. No.
- Come on.</font>

437
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the wildest thing
you've ever done?</font>

438
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I... No, I don't know.
I shouldn't.</font>

439
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go first.</font>

440
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, um...</font>

441
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few months ago,
Sean and I had his TA over</font>

00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">for dinner and drinks,
and a threesome.</font>

443
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was Sean jealous of him?</font>

444
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I say it was a him?</font>

445
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very cool, sis.
Very cool.</font>

446
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- Yeah!</font>

447
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't mean to freak you out.
- Hello!</font>

448
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not freaked out.
Maybe you're freaked out.</font>

449
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Because I'm not freaked out.</font>

450
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cool. I'm laissez-faire.</font>

451
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, laissez-faire.</font>

452
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you're not exactly
a sexual maverick.</font>

453
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's fine. You know,
prudes are people too.</font>

454
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know
your secret. Tell me.</font>

455
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad died when I was
a senior in high school.</font>

456
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,549
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And...</i></font>

457
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>this boy showed up
to the funeral.</i></font>

458

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>His name was Chris</i></font>

459
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,766
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and I guess he was
the spitting image</i></font>

460
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,977
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>of my father
30 years younger.</i></font>

461

she saw a ghost. It...</i></font>

462
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,740
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And it turned out
he was my half-brother.</i></font>

463
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your whole secret?
That your dad had an affair?</font>

464
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

465
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, can you
just tell me your secret?</font>

466
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
spill it, dark side.</font>

467
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Chris...</font>

468
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was too late for him to drive
home, so he stayed over.</i></font>

469
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We stayed up all night,
talking and...</i></font>

470
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,137
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My dad was...</i></font>

471
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad was really the person
who understood me.</font>

472
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was gone, so...</font>

473
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was alone-alone
for the first time.</font>

474
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,276
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But he sees me, you know?</i></font>

475
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like, he really sees me.</i></font>

476
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we just stared at each
other for the longest time.</font>

477
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be too drunk in my
house not to finish the story.</font>

478
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Uh, yeah. Uh...</font>

479
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, I don't know,</font>

480
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe it's not so racy
where you're from, but...</font>

481
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop avoiding.
Tell me what happened.</font>

482
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,438
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We stood there
for the longest time.</i></font>

483
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,587
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Uh-huh.</i></font>

484
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,548
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I went in to hug him and...</i></font>

485
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,342
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and we kissed.</i></font>

486
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,802
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know. It's so gross.</i></font>

487
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The end?
- Yeah.</font>

488
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You just kissed?
- Yeah, we kissed.</font>

489
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just kissed your brother?</font>

490
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,393
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Yeah. It's so...
- What?</i></font>

491
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,310
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ugh. It's so lurid.</i></font>

492
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,397
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's my half-brother.
It's not my brother, but...</i></font>

493
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,999
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's your half-brother,
though? Oh, okay.</i></font>

494
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- It's my...
- Yeah, there's more.</i></font>

495
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,336
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- No. No, there's not more.
- Mmm-hmm.</i></font>

496
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Yeah, there is.</font>

497
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So...
- You fucked him.</font>

498
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

499
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,782
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Was he good?</i></font>

500
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,035
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That is so disgusting.</i></font>

501
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,577
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't know...</i></font>

502
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,347

- I don't...</i></font>

503
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,349
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Tell me you didn't fuck him.

504
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,814
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Swear.
- I swear.</i></font>

505
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear on your dad's grave.</font>

506
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

507
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,817

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your number
from the school directory.</font>

586
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has something
happened to Nicky?</font>

587
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,213
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No! Uh, Nicky's fine.</i></font>

588
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's... Yeah, sorry, he's fine.
He's here with me.</font>

589
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Emily, though,
asked me to watch him and...</font>

590
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was two days ago,
and I haven't heard from her.</font>

591
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,684
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Have you guys been in touch?</i>
- Christ, two days?</font>

592
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,229
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What'd she tell you?</i></font>

593
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said she had
to put out a big fire.</font>

594
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I called her office
and they said she was in Miami?</font>

595
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,192
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, that sounds
about right.</i></font>

596
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I've played through</font>

597
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">some of these
emergencies before.</font>

598
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,614
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And once she knows
that Nicky's</i></font>

599
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,574
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>being taken care of,
she disappears</i></font>

600
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">for quite some time.</font>

601
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, fun! Um...
- I'm flying back tomorrow.</font>

602
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pick up Nicky as soon
as I'm on the ground.</font>

603
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,166
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- All righty?</i>
- Yea... All righty.</font>

604
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

605
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Canterbury Tales.</font>

606
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, her assistant,
Valerie, said that</font>

607
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">she couldn't get in touch
with her either,</font>

608
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is weird 'cause it's
a work thing, an emergency.</font>

609
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the moms think
we should go to the police.</font>

610
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.
Has it really come to this?</font>

611
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want tea?</font>

612
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? Let's do it.</font>

613
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the tea. The police.</font>

614
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sean?
- Yeah.</font>

615
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are here.</font>

616
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

617
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when was the last time</font>

618
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">either of you heard from her?</font>

619
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days ago.</font>

620
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in London.
My mother broke her hip.</font>

621
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.</font>

622
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she said
it was a work crisis?</font>

623
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she has
a very high-profile job</font>

624
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a full staff
that she oversees.</font>

625
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most times when a woman
vanishes, she has a reason.</font>

626
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you implying,
exactly?</font>

627
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two didn't have a fight?</font>

628
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something to make you
run off to London?</font>

629
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that
I broke my mother's hip?</font>

630
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">You leave town,
your wife takes off.</font>

631
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe there's, um,</font>

632
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">a close 'friend' she might
be spending some time with.</font>

633
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, that's very rude.</font>

634
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a dedicated
husband and father.</font>

635
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen him with his wife.</font>

636
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you,
they've got more chemistry</font>

637
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">than a science fair.</font>

638
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just exploring
all avenues, ma'am.</font>

639
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that avenue is
a dead end, so you can drop it.</font>

640
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where's Emily's family?</font>

641
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't have any.</font>

642
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was an only child,</font>

643
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager.</font>

644
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:58,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.</font>

645
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll file
a missing person's report</font>

646
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">and contact you
in the next couple of days.</font>

647
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she doesn't turn up,</font>

648
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll contact the local
authorities in Miami.</font>

649
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not planning any more trips,
are you, Mr. Townsend?</font>

650
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm gonna be right here.</font>

651
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be at my house
with my son.</font>

652
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can show ourselves out.</font>

653
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">God knows we've had
our troubles in the past,</font>

654
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't think she'd just
up and leave her child.</font>

655
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, God, she adores Nicky.
She wouldn't do that.</font>

656
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is an enigma, my wife.</font>

657
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what drew me to her.</font>

658
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can also make her impossible.</font>

659
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can be so fiercely private.</font>

660
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sure doesn't
like having</font>

661
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">her picture taken,
I'll tell you that.</font>

662
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember this one time,
she shut down my Facebook</font>

663
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I posted up
a family picture.</font>

664
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Social media
is so tricky.</font>

665
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get close to her,</font>

666
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can never
quite reach her.</font>

667
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's like a beautiful ghost.</font>

668
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never entirely there.</font>

669
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so poetic.</font>

670
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, that's why
you're such a good writer.</font>

671
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a writer
anymore, Stephanie.</font>

672
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave all that up just to chase</font>

673
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">this woman
for the rest of my life.</font>

674
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should order a taxi
and go home.</font>

675
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

676
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gosh, it's 1:25.</font>

677
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stop driving at 1:00 here.</font>

678
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">That couch pulls out, um,</font>

679
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you wanna stay over.</font>

680
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Nicky would love it</font>

681
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you were here
in the morning.</font>

682
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be lovely.</font>

683
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants
more B vitamins?</font>

684
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- I do!</font>

685
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
Are they nice?</font>

686
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah? Delicious?</font>

687
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Hey.</font>

688
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what on Earth
are you making?</font>

689
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are
hangover smoothies.</font>

690
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get it
right out of you.</font>

691
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the kids love them.</font>

692
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little tip -
they have a full portion</font>

693
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">of vegetables in them
and they don't even know it.</font>

694
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables.</font>

695
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

696
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

697
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:04,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna try some?</font>

698
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

699
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good?</font>

700
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we should
get ready for school.</font>

701
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, school, school!</font>

702
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,573
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hi, moms, Stephanie here.</i></font>

703
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,781
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Today I'm making</i></font>

704
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:25,991
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>a new recipe I learned</i></font>

705
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,242
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>for a hangover smoothie.</i></font>

706
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,786
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Uh, it's really nice.</i></font>

707
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,163
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I especially want to thank</i></font>

708
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,705
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>everybody who's written in</i></font>

709
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,374
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>to ask about Emily.</i></font>

710
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,211
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's been four days now.</i></font>

711
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,921
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So...</i></font>

712
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,380
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The good news is that Sean</i></font>

713
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,798
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>is home from London,</i></font>

714
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,049
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and he's working</i></font>

715
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,634
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>very closely with the police.</i></font>

716
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,471
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Um, actually, moms,</i></font>

717
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,181
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know a lot of you</i></font>

718
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,473
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>are hung up on the idea</i></font>

719
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,682
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that the husband</i></font>

720
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,059
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>is always the primary suspect.</i></font>

721
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,061
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know. I've seen 'Law & Order'.</i></font>

722
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,605
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But, um...</i></font>

723
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,815
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>First, I'm here to tell you</i></font>

724
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,567
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sean was in London
when Emily disappeared.</i></font>

725
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,862
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And some of you
have suggested</i></font>

726
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,656
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that he did that
to set up an alibi,</i></font>

727
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,743
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but he's an amazing husband
and an amazing father, so...</i></font>

728
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,663
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The police
haven't been much help.</i></font>

729
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But every mom knows if
you want something done right,</i></font>

730
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,708
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>you have to do it yourself.</i></font>

731
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,835
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I will leave
no stone unturned.</i></font>

732
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,546
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I think that's

please hold.</font>

735
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?</font>

736
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, my name is Stephanie...</font>

737
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis Nylon, please hold.</font>

738
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend works here.
She's been missing...</font>

739
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?</font>

740
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:37,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I tried to call her assistant.
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.</font>

741
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valerie? She wasn't
super helpful.</font>

742
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?</font>

743
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell
if you're talking to me.</font>

744
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're looking right at me...
- Please hold.</font>

745
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay...</font>

746
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?</font>

747
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name's Emily Nelson.</font>

748
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the head
of the PR department.</font>

749
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Emily's not in today.
- I know she's not in.</font>

750
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.</font>

751
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna...</font>

752
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. No, I am not sorry.</font>

753
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to speak
to Dennis Nylon, please?</font>

754
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman's missing, so...</font>

755
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Nylon's not here right now.</font>

756
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Great, I'll wait.
- Knock yourself out.</font>

757
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

758
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dennis Nylon, please hold.</font>

759
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Mr. Nylon?</font>

760
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't accept
unsolicited resumes.</font>

761
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. That's not why I'm here.</font>

762
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um, we have a problem.
- We most certainly do.</font>

763
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">A friend of mine works in
your publicity department...</font>

764
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a vintage
Hermes scarf?</font>

765
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, my Aunt Frieda
gave it to me.</font>

766
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she want you
to hang yourself with it?</font>

767
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that knot.
Jesus fucking Christ!</font>

768
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here about
Emily Nelson.</font>

769
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Emily?
What happened?</font>

770
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asked me to pick up
her son four days ago</font>

771
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she went to Miami.</font>

772
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's still not back.
No texts, no calls.</font>

773
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one in your office
seems to give a crap.</font>

774
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse my language.</font>

775
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kiko.
- Hmm?</font>

776
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did Emily
go to Miami?</font>

777
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know she did.</font>

778
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">We in this office
have learned that</font>

779
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Emily elects
not to tell us something,</font>

780
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's best not to ask.</font>

781
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't she work for you?</font>

782
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily's job
is to stop the apocalypse</font>

783
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">without worrying
any of the designers.</font>

784
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she always
finds a way</font>

785
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">to look fabulous
when she does it.</font>

786
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great!</font>

787
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you suggest
that I do?</font>

788
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never wear a vintage Hermes
scarf with a Gap T-shirt.</font>

789
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were truly Emily's
friend, you would know that.</font>

790
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me,
I have a very busy day.</font>

791
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valerie, my office, now!</font>

792
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

793
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit, sit, sit!
Emily - I want answers. Speak.</font>

794
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steven,
you forgot the shirts.</font>

795
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't
help you with that.</font>

796
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course
he's freaking out.</font>

797
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs someone
to manage this now.</font>

798
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

799
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother fudger.</font>

800
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if it isn't Aunt Frieda's
least favorite niece.</font>

801
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you
doing up there?</font>

802
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corporate spying or just
a common garden shoplifter?</font>

803
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you gotta go
right at them.</font>

804
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially the powerful ones</font>

805
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">or they will fuck you
in the face.</font>

806
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, you bargain basement
Tom Ford,</font>

807
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't have this Ken doll
unhand me this second,</font>

808
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will tell the thousands of
moms that watch my vlog</font>

809
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Dennis Nylon is a bully
who victimizes women</font>

810
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that they should stop
buying your tacky blouses</font>

811
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">made by Indonesian children</font>

812
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if you lose moms,
you lose business.</font>

813
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, number one, they are
not Indonesian children.</font>

814
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are Vietnamese
teenagers.</font>

815
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Number two,
Tom Ford wishes he were me.</font>

816
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:41,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">And number three,
if I'm tacky,</font>

817
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:44,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">okay, you're...</font>

818
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has been fun.</font>

819
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better pray
I don't have a bruise.</font>

820
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder she doesn't like</font>

821
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">having her picture taken.</font>

822
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look
at our little Stephanie.</font>

823
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Comforting
the worried husband.</font>

824
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please. It's an arts
and crafts project.</font>

825
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen her pass up
a chance to use a stapler.</font>

826
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:21,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily's gonna hate those flyers
when she gets back.</font>

827
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not coming back.</font>

828
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you watch 'Dateline'?</font>

829
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:29,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the case isn't solved
in the first 72 hours,</font>

830
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're always dead.</font>

831
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

832
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, perfect timing!</font>

833
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dinner's ready.
The boys are upstairs.</font>

834
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna have them wash
their hands and come down.</font>

835
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um...
- Are you okay?</font>

836
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've just never
experienced anything like this,</font>

837
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">walking into
a fully set dinner table.</font>

838
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah...
This is weird.</font>

839
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm being...
- No, no, no! Not at all.</font>

840
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think anything
stable these days</font>

841
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">is like a gift
from heaven, right?</font>

842
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should tidy up
first, though.</font>

843
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, hey.
- Hello.</font>

844
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Townsend?
- Ah, yes.</font>

845
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Summerville.
We spoke on the phone.</font>

846
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Um...</font>

847
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:12,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stephanie, can you help
the boys with their homework?</font>

848
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

849
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come in. Sorry.
- Thank you.</font>

850
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a pre-dinner snack.</font>

851
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a cute nanny.
- No, no.</font>

852
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one
of my wife's friends.</font>

853
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been helping me out.</font>

854
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:29,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. Can she come
help out around my house too?</font>

855
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">The passenger manifest says</font>

856
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">she wasn't on
any flights to Miami.</font>

857
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she did rent
a white Kia from Budget.</font>

858
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">She paid in cash
for a two-day rental.</font>

859
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, when people
pay in cash,</font>

860
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">that usually means one thing.</font>

861
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you saying?
She's having an affair?</font>

862
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't say that
with any confidence.</font>

863
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you
not track the Kia?</font>

864
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have
toll booth reports coming in</font>

865
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">from across the country,</font>

866
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">assuming she's not
swapping out plates.</font>

867
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna get a description
of your wife</font>

868
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">to every precinct
in the tri-state area, okay?</font>

869
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she have
any distinguishing features?</font>

870
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any birthmarks, tattoos?</font>

871
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a tattoo
on her left wrist.</font>

872
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:05,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great.</font>

873
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's flames and a charity
symbol in the middle.</font>

874
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

875
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- More judgment from you?
- Nope. No, no, no.</font>

876
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she did
things like that.</font>

877
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impulsive, crazy things.</font>

878
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go call this in.</font>

879
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:19,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your wife's friend
I said goodbye.</font>

880
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:25,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a saint.
You don't have to do that.</font>

881
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a saint. I just like
to keep my hands busy.</font>

882
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... I should go.</font>

883
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Flags of the World Day
on Monday.</font>

884
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't even started
on South America.</font>

885
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

886
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't mean sorry.
I mean thank you.</font>

887
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for being
such a good friend.</font>

888
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

889
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a problem-solver.
I just wish I could do more.</font>

890
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing plenty.</font>

891
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, that's where
we are today.</font>

892
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are keeping
our heads up</font>

893
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not jumping
to any conclusions.</font>

894
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are soldiering on</font>

895
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">with cookies and origami.</font>

896
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for you moms
who want to help,</font>

897
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">we know that Emily
was driving a white Kia</font>

898
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">that she rented
from a Budget</font>

899
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">at La Guardia Airport
on the 24th.</font>

900
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I did a little digging,</font>

901
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, um,
the license plate is...</font>

902
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,780
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dear Stephanie, I'm
writing from Standish, Michigan,</i></font>

907
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,547

she was from around here.</i></font>

908
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,208
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hope this help...</i></font>

909
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, um,
Summerville sent the info</font>

910
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the local authorities
in Michigan.</font>

911
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she ever mention Michigan?
Did she have a friend there?</font>

912
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as I knew, she didn't
have any real friends.</font>

913
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not before you.
- Oh.</font>

914
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... How is that possible?</font>

915
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on.</font>

916
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Please
tell me you found her.</font>

917

918
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know.</font>

919
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm heading
there now.</font>

920
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,280

922
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,742

I'm going to go crazy.</font>

923

they are.</font>

961

<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
you watch my vlog.</font>

963
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, to be honest, when
we first started watching it,</font>

964
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">we were just
making fun of you.</font>

965
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, um...</font>

966
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you had some
really helpful hints in there,</font>

967
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially when Lulu
got that rash.</font>

968
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apple cider vinegar
was great.</font>

969
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, great! That's...</font>

970
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

971
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:36,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a real saint to help
her family out like this.</font>

972
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a saint.</font>

973
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily was my friend, and she'd
do the same for me, so...</font>

974
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:41,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you or Sean need me</font>

975
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,646

976
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so sweet, Sona.
Thank you.</font>

977
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the least she could do.
She didn't even bake anything.</font>

978
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna... Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

979
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky,
you don't need to worry.</font>

980
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom's in heaven now.</font>

981
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she's not! Shut up!</font>

982
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ow! Ow! Stop it!
- She's in the ground!</font>

983
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's never coming back!</font>

984
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! You're hurting me!</font>

985
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I hate you!
- Ow! Stop it!</font>

986
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky, get off him!</font>

987
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky, what are you doing?
Get off him!</font>

988
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing?</font>

989
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Calm down, stop that.
- She made this happen!</font>

990
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She made my mom die.
- That's crazy.</font>

991
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know that.
- She's trying to be my new mom!</font>

992
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, I'm not trying
to be your mom.</font>

993
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want my mom!
- I know you do, baby. I know.</font>

994
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But calm down.
- Mom was right. You are a loser!</font>

995
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what she told you,</font>

996
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">drunk at 2:00
in the afternoon?</font>

997
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am trying my best!
- Sean!</font>

998
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a little boy.
Jesus!</font>

999
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky, I'm sorry.</font>

1000
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do I do? What do I do?
- Okay.</font>

1001
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all gonna take a deep,
centering breath now.</font>

1002
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

1003
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna focus
on one thing at a time.</font>

1004
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stay
and talk to Nicky.</font>

1005
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:43,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I need you
to take Miles inside,</font>

1006
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:45,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">put some ice on his nose.</font>

1007
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:47,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you got
a good little shiner coming.</font>

1008
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay.
- Okay.</font>

1009
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

1010
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna talk to you.</font>

1011
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... you're not
my favorite dinner date</font>

1012
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">right now either, buster.</font>

1013
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you should know
that everything</font>

1014
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're feeling right now
is normal.</font>

1015
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can act out
all you want. That's fine.</font>

1016
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't change
what I know.</font>

1017
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:12,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you know?
- That you're a good kid.</font>

1018
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's just sit here
and not talk.</font>

1019
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just sit here and...</font>

1020
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and feel lousy
and watch the grass grow.</font>

1021

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1022
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come on.</font>

1023
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be hard on yourself, yeah?</font>

1024
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the kind of stuff
nobody gets right.</font>

1025
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do. You always do.</font>

1026
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, come on.</font>

1027
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:28,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

1028
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I don't know if we...</font>

1029
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1030
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're right. We shouldn't.
- Yeah.</font>

1031
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1032
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

1033
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ So don't forget me</font>

1034
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Come close</font>

1035
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Be under my skin</font>

1036
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:07,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I can not wait</font>

1037
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:11,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Go under my skin... ♪</font>

1038
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh! Come on.</font>

1039
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious?</font>

1040
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ms. Smothers!</font>

1041
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah. Um...</font>

1042
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come right down.</font>

1043
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1044
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi! Hi!
- Hey, hey.</font>

1045
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I just left something
here, so I was just...</font>

1046
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a key 'cause earlier
Sean gave me a key...</font>

1047
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:50,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not under arrest,
Miss Smothers.</font>

1048
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa!
- FYI.</font>

1049
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should hope not. Oh!</font>

1050
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right. No, no.
- No.</font>

1051
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're very funny.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</font>

1052
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

1053
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sean's not here right now.</font>

1054
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I was actually
hoping to speak to you.</font>

1055
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:07,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Yeah, I went by your house.</font>

1056
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I went by the school.</font>

1057
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:10,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then one of the moms
thought you might be here.</font>

1058
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they? Okay.
Well, that's...</font>

1059
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it Stacy?</font>

1060
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I come in?</font>

1061
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course. I would love that.
- Thank you.</font>

1062
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entrez-vous.</font>

1063
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said that Emily's
your best friend.</font>

1064
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes, we are.</font>

1065
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was she depressed?
- No.</font>

1066
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she had everything.</font>

1067
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had the house
and the job...</font>

1068
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the husband.</font>

1069
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was getting there, yeah.</font>

1070
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:36,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">The neighbors said
they fought a lot.</font>

1071
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they had issues. Um...</font>

1072
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they loved
each other intensely.</font>

1073
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:42,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what issues
did they have?</font>

1074
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">The normal issues. They were
stressed about money.</font>

1075
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:47,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think Emily wanted</font>

1076
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">to slow down
and smell the roses.</font>

1077
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">She slowed down all right.</font>

1078
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:54,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got the autopsy report
right here.</font>

1079
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see here.</font>

1080
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Severe liver damage
suggesting heavy alcohol use.</font>

1081
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:02,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Track marks along her arms
and between her toes."</font>

1082
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, were you aware
of the heroin use?</font>

1083
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's, uh...</font>

1084
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I really
have trouble believing that.</font>

1085
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean...</font>

1086
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">She liked a very
strong martini, but...</font>

1087
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:21,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how she could've
kept that a secret from me,</font>

1088
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:24,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">and especially
from her husband, Sean.</font>

1089
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:26,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you seem
to know Sean pretty well.</font>

1090
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... We've gotten
to know each other</font>

1091
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">over the last few weeks,
just as friends.</font>

1092
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:33,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

1093
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing</font>

1094
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've never dealt
with law enforcement before.</font>

1095
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not really, no.
- Mmm.</font>

1096
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a really nice dress.</font>

1097
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:51,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

1098
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't seem to be
your style, though.</font>

1099
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm very versatile,
Detective,</font>

1100
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you'll find.</font>

1101
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really just trying
to help Sean and Nicky</font>

1102
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:02,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">in their time of grief.</font>

1103
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how is Sean's grief?</font>

1104
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's... He is holding up
very well.</font>

1105
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:09,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">As well as can be expected.</font>

1106
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

1107
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that everything, or...</font>

1108
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you something.</font>

1109
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:20,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you aware
that he took out</font>

1110
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">an extra $4 million
life insurance policy</font>

1111
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:25,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">on Emily before
she disappeared?</font>

1112
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was not aware of that, no.</font>

1113
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... Why? How would I?</font>

1114
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right.</font>

1115
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't...</font>

1116
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. What did...</font>

1117
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you... Are you saying
he had her rubbed out?</font>

1118
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:50,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hired a hitman?</font>

1119
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:53,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say anything
about him hiring a hitman.</font>

1120
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just did.</font>

1121
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I can see</font>

1122
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're enjoying yourself,
Detective Summerville.</font>

1123
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you wanna
grill someone, you should</font>

1124
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">really speak to Emily's
boss, Dennis Nylon.</font>

1125
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could not be
more suspicious.</font>

1126
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's super interesting
because he contacted us</font>

1127
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on.</font>

1128
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he... he sucks.</font>

1129
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1130
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:17,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as you're honest
with me, Ms. Smothers,</font>

1131
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you, you have
nothing to worry about, okay?</font>

1132
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just following breadcrumbs
wherever they lead.</font>

1133
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what?
I'm done for now.</font>

1134
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for your time.</font>

1135
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:31,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your theory
doesn't hold water, you know,</font>

1136
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it doesn't explain</font>

1137
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fake plane ticket
or the rental car.</font>

1138
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would someone
shoot her full of heroin</font>

1139
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a summer camp in Michigan?</font>

1140
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's plenty of good heroin
right here in Connecticut!</font>

1141
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm told.</font>

1142
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, good. Okay,
so we have a lot to talk about.</font>

1143
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, then.
Enjoy the new house.</font>

1144
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:49,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">The worst breadcrumbs
I've ever heard of, you know.</font>

1145
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:51,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't fill a Caesar salad
with those breadcrumbs!</font>

1146
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh! Ugh!</font>

1147
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is this
Caesarean salad so crunchy?</font>

1148
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:51,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Caesar salad, baby,
and it's delicious.</font>

1149
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:52,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in it?</font>

1150
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Breadcrumbs.
- Oh.</font>

1151
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was your day at work?</font>

1152
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grim.</font>

1153
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spent most of the day
explaining the difference</font>

1154
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">between "your" possessive
and "you're" apostrophe R-E</font>

1155
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">to college juniors.</font>

1156
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see how that might
drive a man over the edge.</font>

1157
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, right?</font>

1158
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you boys?</font>

1159
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you guys get up to
today at school?</font>

1160
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw my mom.</font>

1161
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

1162
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:23,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand, Nicky,
that sometimes</font>

1163
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:25,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">we think we see people
that we miss</font>

1164
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:27,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if they're gone.</font>

1165
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:29,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I saw her.</font>

1166
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was right outside
the fence</font>

1167
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the kickball yard
at recess.</font>

1168
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:36,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, lots of people
look like someone else.</font>

1169
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody looks like Mom!</font>

1170
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me
to say hi to Stephanie.</font>

1171
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicky, this is unhealthy.</font>

1172
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miles saw her too.
Right, Miles?</font>

1173
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I did.</font>

1174
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't know.
I was playing tetherball.</font>

1175
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you two hatch this up?</font>

1176
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:55,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a game, like when you
smash everything with trucks?</font>

1177
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you know
what we say about lying.</font>

1178
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not lying!
I saw her! Fuck you!</font>

1179
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Nicky!
- Oopsy!</font>

1180
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1181
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't I get a kiss
good night?</font>

1182
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you do, sweetie.</font>

1183
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:20,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter</font>

1184
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">for earlier, but I...</font>

1185
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, sweetie.</font>

1186
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1187
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get naked.</font>

1188
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:47,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

1189
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:48,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?</font>

1190
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smell her, Sean.
I smell her perfume.</font>

1191
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all over Nicky
like a ghost.</font>

1192
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:56,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably got
to her perfume bottle</font>

1193
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:57,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the medicine cabinet.</font>

1194
00:55:58,023 --> 00:55:59,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">He misses her.</font>

1195
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? It's just you
being paranoid.</font>

1196
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it? Because
I found this too.</font>

1197
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:05,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

1198
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the friendship
bracelet I made her.</font>

1199
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid to say
she would not have kept this.</font>

1200
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:12,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">She hated stuff like this.</font>

1201
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">She probably gave it to him
right after you gave it to her.</font>

1202
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless he's telling the truth.</font>

1203
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw her
with your own eyes.</font>

1204
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">In her coffin.</font>

1205
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was something off.</font>

1206
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found her
at the bottom of a lake!</font>

1207
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw her tattoo,</font>

1208
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother.</font>

1209
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said your mother
wanted her to have that ring.</font>

1210
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:34,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said your
mother insisted.</font>

1211
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what she told you?</font>

1212
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:39,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father gave that ring
to my mother.</font>

1213
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:41,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like the only bit of
jewelry that she ever owned.</font>

1214
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took Emily to London to meet
my mother after we eloped.</font>

1215
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">It went missing that weekend.</font>

1216
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother was frantic.
We searched everywhere.</font>

1217
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. We didn't
find a single thing.</font>

1218
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:55,121
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My mother was devastated.</i></font>

1219
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:58,041
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So we took our flight
back to New York.</i></font>

1220
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what I found.</font>

1221
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you find?</font>

1222
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1223
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way!</font>

1224
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little Sherlock Holmes.</font>

1225
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mum is gonna
be so relieved.</font>

1226
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:12,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, baby.</font>

1227
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom will take it
to the grave. What a waste.</font>

1228
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so pretty.</font>

1229
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:17,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

1230
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not amusing, my darling,
not in the slightest.</font>

1231
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:23,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not joking
in the slightest...</font>

1232
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:25,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">my darling.</font>

1233
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it. I don't have any
intention of giving it back.</font>

1234
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course
we're gonna give it back.</font>

1235
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1236
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:34,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll tell her it just slipped
into your purse by accident,</font>

1237
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:36,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we've only
found it now.</font>

1238
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you tell her
that I found it,</font>

1239
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I have to tell her
that I stole it.</font>

1240
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do you think
will be worse for her?</font>

1241
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thinking that
she lost her ring,</font>

1242
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">or thinking that her son
married a thief?</font>

1243
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Baby...
- Hey.</font>

1244
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You choose, her or me?</font>

1245
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.</font>

1246
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock twice.</font>

1247
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:26,880
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nine months later,
Nicky was born.</i></font>

1248
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,047
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How could you stay with her?</i></font>

1249
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:31,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was spellbound.</font>

1250
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:33,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was the only woman
I could never figure out fully.</font>

1251
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as a young,
arrogant writer,</font>

1252
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:38,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never live up
to what she expected of me.</font>

1253
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was always
looking over my shoulder.</font>

1254
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:41,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could hardly sleep.</font>

1255
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with you, it's different.</font>

1256
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sleep like a log.</font>

1257
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what every woman
wants to hear.</font>

1258
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean.</font>

1259
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand me,
you see me.</font>

1260
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've rebuilt me,
Stephanie.</font>

1261
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've even started
writing again.</font>

1262
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">First couple of chapters,</font>

1263
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's a start.</font>

1264
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1265
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's wonderful.</font>

1266
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:06,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took a broken man</font>

1267
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you pieced him
back together again.</font>

1268
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're unlike any other
woman I've ever met.</font>

1269
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move in with me.</font>

1270
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:17,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sean.</font>

1271
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's too soon.
What will people think?</font>

1272
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're already thinking it.</font>

1273
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:23,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm tired of lying.
I'm tired of pretending.</font>

1274
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be this man.</font>

1275
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man I am with you.</font>

1276
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't do threesomes.</font>

1277
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:32,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to say that. I'll just
get that out in the open.</font>

1278
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

1279
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your TA?</font>

1280
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:39,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily told me
about your little moment.</font>

1281
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:40,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's what she told you?
- Yes.</font>

1282
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stephanie, listen.
Emily was a pathological liar.</font>

1283
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">That never happened, okay?</font>

1284
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you take out
a $4 million</font>

1285
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">insurance policy on her?</font>

1286
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gosh. Those cops really did
a number on you, didn't they?</font>

1287
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm being serious.
- It was because of you.</font>

1288
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Emily found out
that you had been</font>

1289
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">living off your husband's
insurance money,</font>

1290
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:03,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">she thought she and I
needed to get policies</font>

1291
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">out for Nicky's sake.</font>

1292
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably the most
responsible thing we ever did.</font>

1293
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to you.</font>

1294
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move in with me.</font>

1295
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can start a whole new,
wonderful life together.</font>

1296
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just you, me and the boys.</font>

1297
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, say yes.</font>

1298
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you,
Stephanie Smothers.</font>

1299
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:29,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you too.</font>

1300
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm...</font>

1301
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,248

1311
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,059

right now,</i></font>

All you need is a good friend.</font>

Don't you miss sex?</font>

1384
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,436

on top of a washing machine?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Barely remember
what it's like.</font>

1386

<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you
such a masochist?</font>

1387
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have a man
in your bed anytime you want.</font>

1388

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had a man. I ruined that.
- What does that mean?</font>

1389
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,780

- No...</font>

1390

you can't tell anyone.</font>

1394
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,121
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What are you talking about?</i></font>

1395
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">About Miles and Chris.</font>

1396
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris? My brother, Chris?</font>

1397
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't...
- Yeah, your brother.</font>

1398
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you certainly
don't act like it.</font>

1399
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it's more like
you guys are lovers, right?</font>

1400
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's disgusting. That's...</font>

1401
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Miles mine or not?</font>

1402
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1403
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you listening
to yourself?</font>

1404
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound ridiculous.</font>

1405
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1406
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Davis! Davis!</font>

1407
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

1408
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Da... Where are you going?
Davis?</font>

1409
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steph, it's all right.
Don't worry.</font>

1410
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna
go for a drive.</font>

1411
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a little talk.
Man to man. No problem.</font>

1412

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's my fault.</i></font>

1413
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:32,967

they're both dead.</font>

1414
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:34,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1415
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:36,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't do that.</font>

1416
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:38,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">People... people
do terrible things</font>

1417
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">for their own
fucked-up reasons.</font>

1418
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's on them, not on you.
- Yeah.</font>

1419
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss him.</font>

1420
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one?</font>

1421
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:51,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both.</font>

1422
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:56,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lonely.</font>

1423
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:59,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think loneliness
probably kills more people</font>

1426
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

1427
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're okay.
Want to order pizza?</font>

1428
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:35,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. God,
I'm so embarrassed.</font>

1429
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:40,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, because of that?
No, hey. It's all good, baby.</font>

1430
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all good.
Just another Tuesday.</font>

1433
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you paint this?</font>

1434
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where on Earth
did you find it?</font>

1435
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:48,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should start by giving you
some unfortunate news. Um...</font>

1436
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily's dead.</font>

1437
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">My condolences.</font>

1438
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:54,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the fuck is Emily?</font>

1439
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:56,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl in the painting.</font>

1440
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:02,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Her name's not Emily.</font>

1441
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name's Claudia.</font>

1442
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rest in peace, asshole.</font>

1443
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, not a pleasant memory
for you, then?</font>

1444
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, opposite.
She was amazing.</font>

1445
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, she was the best
that I ever had.</font>

1446
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was selling paintings.</font>

1447
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
it was the first time</font>

1448
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my career
that I had any buzz.</font>

1449
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">She walked
into my gallery.</font>

1450
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real fucking muse
just right out of thin air.</font>

1451
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- She was all I could paint.</font>

1452
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I memorized
every inch of her body.</font>

1453
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dealer fucking hated it.</font>

1454
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:34,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the art critics
fucking hated it.</font>

1455
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called me a knockoff,
a dyke Mapplethorpe.</font>

1456
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:41,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I blew my whole career
painting that con artist.</font>

1457
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now all I paint
are these goddamn knives,</font>

1458
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">which are pretty good, but
nobody wants to buy this shit.</font>

1459
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:49,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what? They're so good.
People are just jealous.</font>

1460
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had a drink
in 42 days.</font>

1461
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:57,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, don't...
- Might as well celebrate.</font>

1462
01:10:57,755 --> 01:11:00,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, well, cheers.</font>

1463
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave her my heart
and I gave her my soul.</font>

1464
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid for her
to go to college.</font>

1465
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid off her debts.</font>

1466
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever
see any heroin use?</font>

1467
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No way, her?</font>

1468
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she didn't touch it.</font>

1469
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

1470
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:21,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">She never let me paint
her face except for this one.</font>

1471
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:24,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen
such a beautiful girl</font>

1472
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">want to be so invisible</font>

1473
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">or just completely vanish.</font>

1474
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:32,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what,
it takes money to vanish.</font>

1475
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:36,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so she took everything
that she could from me.</font>

1476
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:39,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
how I would paint you?</font>

1477
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beatific.</font>

1478
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like... like a fucking saint.</font>

1479
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get that a lot.</font>

1480
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should embrace it.
People love saints.</font>

1481
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. After they're dead.</font>

1482
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. What do you know
about her? How did she die?</font>

1483
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a lake.</font>

1484
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">On heroin.</font>

1485
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:06,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you don't believe that
or you wouldn't be here.</font>

1486
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't ever mention
Michigan, did she?</font>

1487
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

1488
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:19,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the only thing
that she ever left here.</font>

1489
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said she had it
since she was a kid.</font>

1490
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:27,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warn you, you go
poking around in her past,</font>

1491
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna find
some shit that is terrifying.</font>

1492
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was not a normal person
like you or me.</font>

1493
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sean, it's Stephanie...</font>

1494
01:12:36,145 --> 01:12:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought about
what you said.</font>

1495
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're right.
These are just stages of grief.</font>

1496
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">This experience has been
so stressful for both of us,</font>

1497
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:44,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna take
a couple of days to myself.</font>

1498
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have Sona pick up the boys,</font>

1499
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they can stay
at her house tonight.</font>

1500
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should take
some time too.</font>

1501
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's ham stew
in the freezer.</font>

1502
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five minutes in the microwave.
Lots of love.</font>

1503
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
we've been saving young souls</font>

1504
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:58,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">going on 50 years now.</font>

1505
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not Bobby and me personally.</font>

1506
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it seems just perfect!</font>

1507
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my son's
practically a porpoise,</font>

1508
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I know he's gonna love
swimming in that pond.</font>

1509
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's Squaw Lake!</font>

1510
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kids all joke
that it's holy water.</font>

1511
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any fish
you pull out of there</font>

1512
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">is guaranteed
to feed a multitude.</font>

1513
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh. That's so funny.</font>

1514
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... have you guys
got any old photo albums</font>

1515
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a yearbook I could look at?</font>

1516
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always feel like
there's no better review</font>

1517
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:24,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a place than the faces
of the campers.</font>

1518
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:27,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, heck, yeah. We got a ton
of 'em down in the basement.</font>

1519
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:28,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see nothing but smiles.</font>

1520
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope and Faith.</font>

1521
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. I'm looking
for the McLanden Foundation.</font>

1522
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:02,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this Margaret McLanden?</font>

1523
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,899
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who's this?</i></font>

1524
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Hi, there. My name's
Maryanne Chelkowsky.</font>

1525
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the director
of the Squaw Lake Bible Camp.</font>

1526
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,530
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What do you want?</i></font>

1527
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:13,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we are putting together
the 50th anniversary</font>

1529
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:16,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to track down
some star alumni.</font>

1530
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,957
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Are you any relation to
Hope and Faith McLanden?</i></font>

1531
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,042
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Hello?
- Bruce, it's that camp.</i></font>

1532
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,211
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The girls must have done
something again and...</i></font>

1533
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,898
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The girls
are long gone, Mrs. M.</i></font>

1534
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,463
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You just go on back
to your chair.</i></font>

1535
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,951
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But it's filthy there,
Bruce. I've asked you a...</i></font>

1536
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotcha.</font>

1537
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your time, Bruce.</font>

1538
01:15:38,577 --> 01:15:40,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. McLanden?</font>

1539
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Gloria
from the cleaning service.</font>

1540
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:45,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- Didn't Bruce tell you?</font>

1541
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to clean the
entire place until you could eat</font>

1542
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">a four-course meal
off the floor.</font>

1543
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I get the date...</font>

1544
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:52,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot!</font>

1545
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start in my
upstairs bathroom.</font>

1546
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:06,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not lying
if I'm actually cleaning.</font>

1547
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce!
The fire's dying!</font>

1548
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce!</font>

1549
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't help noticing</font>

1550
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">that lovely picture
of your daughters.</font>

1551
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:50,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where... where's Bruce?</font>

1552
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:52,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bruce!
- Oh, um...</font>

1553
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:55,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce had to go out. Um...</font>

1554
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:58,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">So your daughter, Faith...</font>

1555
01:16:58,573 --> 01:16:59,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had some trouble,
I gather?</font>

1556
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troubles!</font>

1557
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troubles would've
been a vacation.</font>

1558
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:09,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">That child came
straight from hell.</font>

1559
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:12,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a very strong
statement for a mother.</font>

1560
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you a mother?
- Yes.</font>

1561
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love every minute of it.</font>

1562
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

1563
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you must have
brain damage.</font>

1564
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a thankless business.</font>

1565
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some children
are just born rotten.</font>

1566
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't need a parent.</font>

1567
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need an exorcist.</font>

1568
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:31,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">My husband understood that.</font>

1569
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now, just... Wait.</font>

1570
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't. Don't tell Bruce!</font>

1571
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Bingo!</font>

1572
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unseemly,
the way that man polices me.</font>

1573
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like
some sherry?</font>

1574
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, thank you.
You're very sweet.</font>

1575
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:46,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, that's...</font>

1576
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not sherry.
That's the gin.</font>

1577
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the sherry?</font>

1578
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be behind
the Sylvia Plath.</font>

1579
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">What ever happened
to Faith?</font>

1580
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, everything. Everything.</font>

1581
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">We spent so much money
on her rehab.</font>

1582
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope tried to help
take care of her</font>

1583
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:03,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get her...</font>

1584
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">off that stuff.</font>

1585
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:07,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Hope's a born
liar with terrible posture.</font>

1586
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Mrs. McLanden?</font>

1587
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you... do you know
the person in this photograph?</font>

1588
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Faith. That's Faith!</font>

1589
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:21,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, why are you...
Did she send you?</font>

1590
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I'm not even sure...
- Are you the police?</font>

1591
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm just ask...</font>

1592
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:26,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have told you people
a thousand times.</font>

1593
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:29,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">My memory is not good anymore.
It will not stand up in court.</font>

1594
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night of that fire,</font>

1595
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">my husband and I
were estranged.</font>

1596
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lived in separate wings
of the house.</font>

1597
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fire that burned down
the west wing?</font>

1598
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you an insurance agent?</font>

1599
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Oh!</font>

1600
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good! Oh, good, good.</font>

1601
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:48,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Bruce and I have been
waiting for the insurance money.</font>

1602
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:52,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you assholes
had that clause about arson.</font>

1603
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, arson. Yeah.
- Vultures.</font>

1604
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's to being house poor!</font>

1605
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ain't supposed
to be drinking, Mrs. M.</font>

1606
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you?
- Well, uh...</font>

1607
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much
for your time, Mrs. McLanden.</font>

1608
01:19:02,823 --> 01:19:05,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will get you that
faux Givenchy suit in ivory</font>

1609
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the scarf in taupe.</font>

1610
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:10,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will put a rush on it!

the lake could be this sister.</font>

1757
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:07,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could explain
the DNA match.</font>

1758
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if that's the case,
then where is Emily?</font>

1759
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my wife was still alive,
she'd come home.</font>

1760
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd wanna see her son.</font>

1761
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a cop, and I'm
definitely no therapist.</font>

1762
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just an insurance guy.</font>

1763
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is an incredibly
interesting case.</font>

1764
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:33,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is just bananas, isn't it?
- Yeah.</font>

1765
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will say,
it's unusual</font>

1766
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:37,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">to live with someone
as husband and wife</font>

1767
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not know
that they have a twin.</font>

1768
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she was a very
private person.</font>

1769
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hey,
we all have our secrets.</font>

1770
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:47,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, as I'm sure
you can understand,</font>

1771
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a payment of this size,</font>

1772
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll have to continue
this claims investigation.</font>

1773
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1774
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:55,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, by law, give all our
findings to the authorities.</font>

1775
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:57,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,
anything you need.</font>

1776
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:59,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope that my wife
is still alive.</font>

1777
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want her back.</font>

1778
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okey-dokey, then.</font>

1779
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, if you
do hear from her...</font>

1780
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:10,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You'll be the first to know.
- Thank you so much!</font>

1781
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thank you.
Thanks for the coffee.</font>

1782
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:16,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye. Thank you so much again.
- Thanks. Yeah.</font>

1783
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:18,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew that she had a twin.</font>

1784
01:27:18,902 --> 01:27:21,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I? Why didn't you?</font>

1785
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew
and you didn't tell me.</font>

1786
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sean.</font>

1787
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound crazy.</font>

1788
01:27:26,743 --> 01:27:27,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1789
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a Xanax.</font>

1790
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:31,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take two.</font>

1791
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,291
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i></font>

1792
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:34,626
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Today, we're talking about</i></font>

1793

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>tombstone tributes.</i></font>

1794
01:27:36,002 --> 01:27:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I want to thank Helen</i></font>

1795
01:27:37,462 --> 01:27:39,181
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>from Missoula, Montana,
for the suggestions,</i></font>

1796
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>for thinking outside the box.</i></font>

1797
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,634
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You know, it doesn't have</i></font>

1798

1799
01:27:44,636 --> 01:27:47,012
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I think any item that</i></font>

1800
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,681
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>sparks a fond memory is perfect.</i></font>

1801
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:52,185
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And Emily's favorite treat
was a dry gin martini</i></font>

1802
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:54,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>in the late afternoon.</i></font>

1803
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,439
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm gonna make a couple
just like Emily used to.</i></font>

1804
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:59,442
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Frozen gin, frozen glass,</i></font>

1805
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>generous twist.</i></font>

1806
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,404
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm gonna head out there
a little later today.</i></font>

1807
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,239
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Have a toast on her grave.</i></font>

1808
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:12,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice big twist.
I taught you well.</font>

1809
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Student's become
the master.</font>

1810
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, wisdom.</font>

1811
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:20,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, give me that.</font>

1812
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
what tricks you have</font>

1813
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">up those new
sleeves of yours.</font>

1814
01:28:24,634 --> 01:28:26,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think
I poisoned both drinks?</font>

1815
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not my style.</font>

1816
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even eat gluten.</font>

1817
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:34,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Want another?
- Please.</font>

1818
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:38,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, tell me why you killed
your father and sister.</font>

1819
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, why don't we first talk
about your son's real father?</font>

1820
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:43,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Emily,
I hold all the cards here.</font>

1821
01:28:44,112 --> 01:28:45,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know
about your twin, Faith.</font>

1822
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:48,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a twin.
- Great. I know that you are.</font>

1823
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:51,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were triplets.
Faith, Hope, and Charity.</font>

1824
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charity was stillborn.</font>

1825
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom thought
we offed her in the womb.</font>

1826
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Dad believed her.</font>

1827
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's quite a woman,
your mother.</font>

1828
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a nice afternoon
with Mags.</font>

1829
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You met my mother?</font>

1830
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">She likes her martinis
even stronger than yours.</font>

1831
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a little walk
down memory lane.</font>

1832
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:10,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a cold woman, Em.</font>

1833
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet you couldn't do
anything right in her eyes.</font>

1834
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:15,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was probably
Faith's idea to set the fire.</font>

1835
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then all the bad ideas
were Faith's, weren't they?</font>

1836
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't know anything.
- Sure I do.</font>

1837
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:20,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I get it.</font>

1838
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,358
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're 16.</i></font>

1839
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,360
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's that age
where you feel so trapped.</i></font>

1840
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:29,573
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And if your mother always
had the biting comment...</i></font>

1841
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Faith, it's over. Let's go!
- Dad! Dad!</font>

1842
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:40,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dad! Don't touch me!
- It's not my fault!</font>

1843
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,180
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm guessing your father
was more direct.</i></font>

1844
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">MR. Whore!</font>

1845
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never again!
- Stop!</font>

1846
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:47,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when you and Faith</font>

1847
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">learned to hit
the reset button, right?</font>

1848
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:51,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn, baby, burn.</font>

1849
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,751
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why'd you leave each other?</i></font>

1850
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we couldn't stay
together after the fire.</font>

1851
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:06,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cops were looking for
the big blonde arson twins.</font>

1852
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:09,488
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We were a walking sideshow.</i></font>

1853
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off!</font>

1854
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">We... we had to say goodbye,
so we did it with tattoos -</font>

1855
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:17,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">flames and a little
something for Charity.</font>

1856
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:24,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">We split up
in Corpus Christi.</font>

1857
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,381
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She was gonna head south to
Mexico, I was gonna go north.</i></font>

1858
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,175
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We set a time
and place to meet</i></font>

1859
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,219
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>after the smoke cleared.</i></font>

1860
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:33,304
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But then
she never showed up.</i></font>

1861
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,807
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was worried sick.
I waited for days.</i></font>

1862
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:38,434
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But nothing.</i></font>

1863
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I thought
maybe this was</font>

1864
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">my opportunity
to do it on my own.</font>

1865
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was always
getting me into trouble.</font>

1866
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I bought a one-way ticket to
New York and never looked back.</font>

1867
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you miss her?
- Of course I missed her.</font>

1868
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't whole without her.
But I couldn't go on like that.</font>

1869
01:30:50,363 --> 01:30:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had to survive.
- And it worked.</font>

1870
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, my life in New York
fell into place.</font>

1871
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:56,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a job,
worked my way up.</font>

1872
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met the perfect man.</font>

1873
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know
that part, though.</font>

1874
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:04,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And then your sister calls.
- Fucking Facebook.</font>

1875
01:31:04,377 --> 01:31:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You had to see her.
- Yeah, of course I did.</font>

1876
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you fabricate
this trip to Miami,</font>

1877
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:11,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">meet up at the old camp.</font>

1878
01:31:11,175 --> 01:31:13,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Camp bunk four.
It was our happy place.</font>

1879
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,224
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was the only place we could
escape our dad, really.</i></font>

1880
01:31:26,858 --> 01:31:28,317
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It must have been shocking</i></font>

1881
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:30,194
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>to see her
after all those years.</i></font>

1882
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:34,323
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, it was like
looking in the mirror...</i></font>

1883
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">except at the sick life
she chose over me.</font>

1884
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:39,787
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- What did she want?
- Everything.</i></font>

1885
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:44,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just gonna stand there?</font>

1886
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:46,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta have Faith.</font>

1887
01:31:46,252 --> 01:31:48,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hear from you
for 14 years,</font>

1888
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now here you are?</font>

1889
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm out of cash.
- Shocking.</font>

1890
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:56,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuck did you say?</font>

1891
01:31:58,389 --> 01:31:59,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. I just...</font>

1892
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:01,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away with it this time.</font>

1893
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:03,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, um... now what?</font>

1894
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I didn't know where to go.</font>

1895
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I call,
you act like a stranger.</font>

1896
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:09,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't even let me
come meet your family.</font>

1897
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I supposed
to say to them?</font>

1898
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth?</font>

1899
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you may as well now</font>

1900
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I'm about
to tell the cops.</font>

1901
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:20,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're what?
- I don't know what else to do.</font>

1902
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:22,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I don't have anything,</font>

1903
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I don't really have
anything to lose.</font>

1904
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go tell them
everything we did</font>

1905
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then, you know,
we'll go down together.</font>

1906
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:29,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can be together again.</font>

1907
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a little boy now.</font>

1908
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:34,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know. I saw that kid.
He's super cute.</font>

1909
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:37,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the shit, okay?
What do you want from me?</font>

1910
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a million bucks.</font>

1911
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed
to give you that?</font>

1912
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're rich and famous now.</font>

1913
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:45,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't give you
a million dollars.</font>

1914
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:47,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do seem
highly motivated.</font>

1915
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:50,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what it is, though.
I don't think it's your job.</font>

1916
01:32:50,942 --> 01:32:52,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably, um...
probably your kid.</font>

1917
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk about Nicky.</font>

1918
01:32:55,488 --> 01:32:57,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll, um...</font>

1919
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:00,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll sell the house.
I'll do whatever I need to do.</font>

1920
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:02,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I do this,
you can't tell anyone ever.</font>

1921
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.</font>

1922
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:07,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I don't really get
the big deal, though,</font>

1923
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:10,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause you and me could always
just make another kid.</font>

1924
01:33:10,377 --> 01:33:12,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that, right?</font>

1925
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't make
another sister, though.</font>

1926
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's fucking hot.</font>

1927
01:33:17,551 --> 01:33:19,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
let's go swimming.</font>

1928
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:21,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember?
Like we used to.</font>

1929
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You coming?
- Yeah.</font>

1930
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:26,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right behind you.</font>

1931
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,296
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How'd you
get her in the lake?</i></font>

1932
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,963
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fuck you.
I didn't kill my sister.</i></font>

1933
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:41,742
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That was her idea.</i></font>

1934
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, wimp.</font>

1935
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:54,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I thought
you were the alpha now.</font>

1936
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

1937
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the alpha,
God damn it.</font>

1938
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You abandoned me.</font>

1939
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:19,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were supposed
to be a team, you and me.</font>

1940
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:21,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remember?
- Yeah, I know we were.</font>

1941
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I just thought</font>

1942
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only chance
we had was alone, so...</font>

1943
01:34:26,996 --> 01:34:28,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

1944
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:30,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, kid.</font>

1945
01:34:34,837 --> 01:34:36,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

1946
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:33,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was so worried.</i></font>

1947
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:34,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I woke up the next morning</font>

1948
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I couldn't
find her anywhere.</font>

1949
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought...</font>

1950
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,738

she'd do that, you know?</font>

1951
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I found her body
in the lake, it was too late.</font>

1952
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lie. You drowned her.</font>

1953
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:53,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she killed herself.</font>

1954
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just all that's left of her.</font>

1955
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:57,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, you're a sister killer.
- You're a brotherfucker.</font>

1956
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

1957
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does Sean know?</font>

1958
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything.</font>

1959
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:03,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was his idea.</font>

1960
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:06,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what to do
once I found the body</font>

1961
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he said, "You know,
maybe this is our opportunity.</font>

1962
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:09,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We could finally
get out of debt,</font>

1963
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">"flee the country,</font>

1964
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">"spend more time with Nicky."</font>

1965
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">He convinced me
we could pull it off,</font>

1966
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, that her DNA
would do the rest.</font>

1967
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:19,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe you.
He grieved for you.</font>

1968
01:36:19,567 --> 01:36:22,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you believed that?
Aw, that was all an act.</font>

1969
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:23,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a pathological liar.</font>

1970
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:25,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Sean say that?</font>

1971
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

1972
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:31,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna play you
this tune real quick.</font>

1973
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:37,333
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Do you love her?
- No.</i></font>

1974
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:38,877
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was just sex.</i></font>

1975
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,212
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?</i></font>

1976
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,756
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes.</i></font>

1977
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,050
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do you love me
or not, baby?</i></font>

1978
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,801
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Of course I do.</i></font>

1979
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:48,679
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She doesn't mean
a thing to me.</i></font>

1980
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:51,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, baby. I know
you thought it was real.</font>

1981
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:55,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, hey, I mean,
look on the bright side.</font>

1982
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your website went viral
thanks to me.</font>

1983
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this for a little money?</font>

1984
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:02,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little $4 million?</font>

1985
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:05,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not exactly little, huh?</font>

1986
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:07,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hiding out
till that money came in.</font>

1987
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:09,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was just gonna
tie up some loose ends.</font>

1988
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I a loose end?</font>

1989
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:12,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he needed
help with Nicky.</font>

1990
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so good
with those kids.</font>

1991
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:16,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what happens now?</font>

1992
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:18,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want my kid.</font>

1993
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucked up
my insurance plan.</font>

1994
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">The authorities
won't back down on that.</font>

1995
01:37:22,296 --> 01:37:23,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can have Sean.
He's a piece of shit.</font>

1996
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't even want him.
- I don't want Sean.</font>

1997
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I don't know.
I guess there's...</font>

1998
01:37:29,595 --> 01:37:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another way, but...</font>

1999
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:34,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's sort of one
mother to another.</font>

2000
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sleeping like a log.</font>

2001
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- What's going on?</font>

2002
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:12,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have a warrant.
I tried to call you.</font>

2003
01:38:13,264 --> 01:38:14,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
I'm Sean Townsend.</font>

2004
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:16,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm happy to comply
with anything you need.</font>

2005
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it would be nice
to have a heads-up.</font>

2006
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:20,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an open investigation.</font>

2007
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:23,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get to pencil
us in when it's convenient.</font>

2008
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

2009
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I under arrest?</font>

2010
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:35,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, not yet.
The DA wants a slam dunk.</font>

2011
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:38,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gonna be pretty hard
since I haven't done anything.</font>

2012
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know
your wife was alive?</font>

2013
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:42,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not until recently.
- When?</font>

2014
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">She contacted me.</font>

2015
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:46,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you immediately notified
the authorities, right?</font>

2016
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't discuss this
without my attorney.</font>

2017
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? You really
are a professor, aren't you?</font>

2018
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll talk soon.</font>

2019
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, if we need
to contact you,</font>

2020
01:38:55,264 --> 01:38:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you be with your wife
or the best friend?</font>

2021
01:38:59,268 --> 01:39:00,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody else?</font>

2022
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:12,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a stiff drink.
Maybe some of your...</font>

2023
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:13,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. You can't come in.</font>

2024
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:16,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Where's Nicky?</font>

2025
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:17,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's upstairs playing.</font>

2026
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:20,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have to go.
- What are you talking about?</font>

2027
01:39:20,247 --> 01:39:21,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an ongoing
investigation, Sean.</font>

2028
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:22,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for fuck's sake.</font>

2029
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you in this house</font>

2030
01:39:24,376 --> 01:39:25,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">until this whole thing's
been solved.</font>

2031
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:27,063

2032
01:39:27,087 --> 01:39:28,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has nothing
to do with Emily.</font>

2033
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got everything
to do with her.</font>

2034
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gaslighting you!</font>

2035
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand
how powerful she is.</font>

2036
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't understand
anything right now.</font>

a good way to go about it.</font>

2189
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:19,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you messed up,
though, baby girl,</font>

2190
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:21,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">is thinking
that I would confess</font>

2191
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">to protect that
fucking yeast infection.</font>

2192
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:25,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- All right.</font>

2193
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you gotta know
better than that.</font>

2194
01:46:27,716 --> 01:46:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

2195
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:30,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you came in,
all emotional with the gun.</font>

2196
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that was...
that was convincing.</font>

2197
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It was very cinematic.</font>

2198
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
where you find this shit.</font>

2199
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:39,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're really amazing.</font>

2200
01:46:39,519 --> 01:46:42,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks. That means a lot.
- Mmm.</font>

2201
01:46:42,189 --> 01:46:43,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you did confess, Emily.</font>

2202
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:46,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah.</font>

2203
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:48,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

2204
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:52,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, but I cut
these first, though.</font>

2205
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:54,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">For our friendship bracelets.</font>

2206
01:46:54,618 --> 01:46:56,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for you!</font>

2207
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:59,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is... disappointing.</font>

2208
01:46:59,706 --> 01:47:02,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! My God!
Look what I found.</font>

2209
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:04,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh!</font>

2210
01:47:04,293 --> 01:47:06,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You can't shoot us.</font>

2211
01:47:06,755 --> 01:47:09,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The police are outside.
- No, they're not.</font>

2212
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:12,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, cops, Stephanie here.</font>

2213
01:47:12,219 --> 01:47:13,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Change of plans.</font>

2214
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:15,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm meeting Emily and Sean
at Darren's house now.</font>

2215
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'll see you there."</font>

2216
01:47:17,224 --> 01:47:18,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent them
to Darren's house?</font>

2217
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:21,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a virus?</font>

2218
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">String theory!
String theory, isn't it?</font>

2219
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands up! Weapons down!</font>

2220
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:27,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I have
a prescription for that!</font>

2221
01:47:28,068 --> 01:47:29,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have ocular pressure!</font>

2222
01:47:29,653 --> 01:47:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been on the run
for 10 years.</font>

2223
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:32,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I don't know how
to manipulate the system?</font>

2224
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:34,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're gonna kill us?</font>

2225
01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:36,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?</font>

2226
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:38,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two will clearly go</font>

2227
01:47:38,578 --> 01:47:40,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">to extraordinary lengths
to take me down.</font>

2228
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:41,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know too much.</font>

2229
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I feel like
a murder-suicide</font>

2230
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:46,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the only fitting end
for you two.</font>

2231
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:47,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you kill him,</font>

2232
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think our insurance
still covers that, right?</font>

2233
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:52,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's sort of perfect.</font>

2234
01:47:52,259 --> 01:47:54,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">One door closes and another
one opens. Thank you for that.</font>

2235
01:47:54,845 --> 01:47:57,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always have been
fucking crazy, haven't you?</font>

2236
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I?</font>

2237
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

2238
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. You're right.</font>

2239
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:05,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, you fucking...
You actually fucking shot me.</font>

2240
01:48:05,689 --> 01:48:07,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna miss him.</font>

2241
01:48:07,356 --> 01:48:08,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn.</font>

2242
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:11,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily, come on.</font>

2243
01:48:11,403 --> 01:48:12,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna kill me.</font>

2244
01:48:12,988 --> 01:48:15,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, I killed
my dad and my sister,</font>

2245
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:18,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I could never kill my
husband-fucking best friend.</font>

2246
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:21,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I really
your best friend?</font>

2247
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not just saying
that for, you know...</font>

2248
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:24,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I'm not
just saying that at all.</font>

2249
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get worried that it's just me.</font>

2250
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, sometimes
I was worried about that too.</font>

2251
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so hard to connect
with other moms...</font>

2252
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:33,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then when you have
a full-time job, it's...</font>

2253
01:48:34,134 --> 01:48:35,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay,
don't pull that crap.</font>

2254
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:38,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being a mom is a full-time job.
What I do is hard work.</font>

2255
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:40,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have my vlog
on top of that,</font>

2256
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:41,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's just getting
bigger and bigger.</font>

2257
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you came on the vlog,
that'd be so fun.</font>

2258
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you came on the vlog
and confessed</font>

2259
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:48,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">to killing your father and
sister and held me at gunpoint,</font>

2260
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:49,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could probably hit
a million subscribers.</font>

2261
01:48:49,858 --> 01:48:51,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww. That would've been great.</font>

2262
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:53,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't we do that right now?
- Hmm?</font>

2263
01:48:54,029 --> 01:48:56,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're live streaming.
Did you not know that?</font>

2264
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:57,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck
are you talking about?</font>

2265
01:48:58,115 --> 01:49:00,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, that's so rude,
I'm sorry.</font>

2266
01:49:00,202 --> 01:49:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wave hi to the moms!</font>

2267
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,914
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This little gadget. Boop!</i></font>

2268
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:07,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. They make nanny cams
so small these days.</font>

2269
01:49:09,252 --> 01:49:10,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brotherfucker!</font>

2270
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily!
Emily, stop!</font>

2271
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:18,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily, you can't outrun this!
Don't do this to Nicky.</font>

2272
01:49:19,011 --> 01:49:21,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you're still his mom!</font>

2273
01:49:24,059 --> 01:49:25,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I am.</font>

2274
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you sure
as shit won't be.</font>

2275
01:49:35,278 --> 01:49:36,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">America's hybrids.</font>

2276
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:38,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silent, but deadly.</font>

2277
01:49:42,953 --> 01:49:44,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you on the vlog.</font>

2278
01:49:44,871 --> 01:49:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fuck with one of the moms,
you fuck with us all.</font>

2279
01:49:47,707 --> 01:49:49,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

2280
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:50,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emily!</font>

2281
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, Emily.</font>

2282
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:55,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">This looks super painful.</font>

2283
01:49:56,131 --> 01:49:57,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, sweetie, stop.</font>

2284
01:49:58,092 --> 01:49:59,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've just been hit by a car.</font>

2285
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:01,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't... don't do this.</font>

2286
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:03,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting worried
about your knees right now.</font>

2287
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:06,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just relax!</font>

2288
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:13,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry!</font>

2289
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:15,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm NOT sorry. Oh!</font>

2290
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:16,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still working on that.</font>
