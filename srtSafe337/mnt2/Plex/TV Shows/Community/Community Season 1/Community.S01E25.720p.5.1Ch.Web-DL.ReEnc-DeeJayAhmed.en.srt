00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for a great year.
You got it.</font>

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger. I hope you will be
seizing the day this summer.</font>

3
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:18,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Professor Whitman.</font>

4
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:21,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I hope you'll be seizing
a more contemporary movie.</font>

5
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking good, Leonard.
Stroke or tai chi?</font>

6
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tai chi.
Keep it up.</font>

7
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And keep up
whatever it is you're doing, Garrett.</font>

8
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:32,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called chillaxing. Duh.</font>

9
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:34,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey-hey, what's up, Jeff? Hi.</font>

10
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, good morning, howdy.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

11
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Jeff. I'll walk with you.</font>

12
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you.
Okay.</font>

13
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:46,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I got class in,
like, five hours, so...</font>

14
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll see you, babe.</font>

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I made it
through my first year of college.</font>

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finally get to click send
on so many l-told-you-so e-mails.</font>

17
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's pretty great.
Not much could ruin today.</font>

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

19
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shoot.
I forgot saying that summons him.</font>

20
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you two be attending
tomorrow's, uh, transfer ceremony</font>

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">to send off all the students
leaving for so-called real schools?</font>

22
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:08,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a formal dance afterward.</font>

23
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:09,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many dances
this school have?</font>

24
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:14,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five. If you come to all of them,
you get one of these.</font>

25
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:16,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assumed your whole posse
would be coming to the dance,</font>

26
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:19,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">having heard the exciting news
about Britta.</font>

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banana rhino.
Yeah, ugh...</font>

28
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banana Sam Elliott.
Oh-ho-ho.</font>

29
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:26,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">LeVar Banana Burton.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banana King Tut.
Here, give me that.</font>

31
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more like this.</font>

32
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banana penis. Ha-ha-ha.</font>

33
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure you would've loved it
if he did it.</font>

34
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:41,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

35
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:43,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happened to you and me,
Troy?</font>

36
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember how hard we laughed when we
first heard the term teacher's aids?</font>

37
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And then we found out
a teacher did have AIDS:</font>

38
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:51,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's everybody doing
this summer?</font>

39
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:53,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking the boys on a trip.</font>

40
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money's tight, I hope I can
convince them for one more year</font>

41
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:58,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">that motels
are tiny little theme parks.</font>

42
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could live in a pyramid.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait.</font>

44
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Your dorm got a bunk bed, right?</font>

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

46
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:16,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... Everyone has to go
to the transfer dance tomorrow.</font>

47
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going.
My friend Gary's transferring.</font>

48
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good.
Finally.</font>

49
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.
Hope he transfers to hell.</font>

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">More importantly,
our very own Britta Perry,</font>

51
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:29,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">it turns out, has been nominated
for transfer queen.</font>

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.</font>

53
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:35,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is a transfer queen?
Like prom queen. You wear a sash.</font>

54
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a vote, and if you win
they put a crown on your head.</font>

55
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I am so jealous,
I want to murder you.</font>

56
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you excited?
No.</font>

57
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:44,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did I get nominated?
Don't let it upset you, Britta.</font>

58
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the last day of semester.
Nothing can ruin that.</font>

59
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Amazing. He's like an evil genie.</font>

60
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just spreading the news.</font>

61
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:54,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some folks say "transfer formal"
isn't really rolling off the tongue,</font>

62
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:59,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we're just gonna
call it the "tranny dance."</font>

63
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much more Greendale.</font>

64
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:08,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Web-dl sync by vNaru</font>

65
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of community college
has a prom?</font>

66
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:12,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proms weren't even cool
in high school.</font>

67
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that kind of crap that made me
drop out in the first place.</font>

68
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:18,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you don't actually have to lie
on a sofa like it's a Woody Allen movie.</font>

69
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for telling me that
in the last session, dumb-ass.</font>

70
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, look, there are bugs
on the windshield of your mind,</font>

71
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may never be able to squeegee
like a certain birthday party</font>

72
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:32,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">attended by a rather enterprising
transient in a dinosaur costume.</font>

73
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are other more
recent streaks</font>

74
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:37,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you might yet
be able to wipe clear,</font>

75
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:41,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">like your adolescent fear
of being a so-called blow-up doll.</font>

76
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really think this nomination
may actually help that.</font>

77
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:47,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you think I'd feel better about
myself if I sexed up, went over there,</font>

78
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:49,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">and really tried to be crowned
queen of the dingbats?</font>

79
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely.
Wow.</font>

80
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess you really get what you
pay for with free therapy.</font>

81
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouch. That stung a little bit. Thanks.</font>

82
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

83
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:00,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll save you time.</font>

84
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">He listens to you talk for a year,
then recommends a makeover.</font>

85
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't wear as much lipstick
as you did on Valentine's Day.</font>

86
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mouth looked
like a coin purse.</font>

87
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:13,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Se√±or Chang, Greendale's foremost,
if only, Spanish teacher.</font>

88
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you?
I am actually a student now.</font>

89
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:22,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was thinking, as a teacher,
and as my friend,</font>

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, if you could help me
cheat my way through school.</font>

91
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:29,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a counterproposal.</font>

92
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about I point out to you
we've never actually been friends,</font>

93
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">then laugh at your
very well-deserved misfortune?</font>

94
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:41,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just try that a second. Ahem.</font>

95
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Jorge, you killed it.
Are you going to Abed's kegger?</font>

96
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,485
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Heck, yeah. You know it, jefe.
Sweet.</i></font>

97
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably don't
wanna talk to me.</font>

98
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not junior high.</font>

99
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're mature adults, Michelle.
We can talk.</font>

100
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I handled our breakup poorly.</font>

101
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I respond to that I'll have to
take an extra-strength vitamin duh.</font>

102
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh.</font>

103
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:10,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">We started getting serious and I got
scared, it's possible I made a mistake.</font>

104
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we can talk about it
sometime.</font>

105
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:15,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss you.</font>

106
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm.</font>

107
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:21,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you take a picture.
It will last longer.</font>

108
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

109
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:38,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dope kegger.
Thanks.</font>

110
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny.</font>

111
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I spend so much time here, I
forget that we don't live together.</font>

112
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:49,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I think,
"What if we lived together?"</font>

113
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, I'm gonna check
on the other keg.</font>

114
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Troy, you ever seen
one of these? It's called a beer bong.</font>

115
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supposed to inhale
though. I almost died outside.</font>

116
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does Abed hate me?
What, are you kidding? Look at him.</font>

117
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably hates America.</font>

118
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, babe. Baby, guess what.</font>

119
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your boyfriend
just got offered a spot</font>

120
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the number one community college
Hacky Sack team in the nation.</font>

121
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:12,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, sweetie.
I'm assuming that's huge.</font>

122
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:14,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it's huge.
Are you kidding me?</font>

123
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:17,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you know. I'm not into fame and stuff,
but I could be the next Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr.</font>

124
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

125
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:24,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one thing, mountain flower, that's
that the, uh, school's in Delaware.</font>

126
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

127
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:30,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, if you don't go
to this dance tomorrow,</font>

128
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are not gonna see
each other for months.</font>

129
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a Jane Austen novel.
We have cell phones.</font>

130
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Aah... Oh.
Oh, jeez, sorry.</font>

131
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

132
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had hair I was gonna move.
You were gonna move my hair?</font>

133
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:46,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Ever thought of yourself
as a guarded person, Britta?</font>

134
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I? Watch.</font>

135
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!
See? It's alarming, right?</font>

136
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

137
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh, Professor Slater, hi.
What are you doing here?</font>

138
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know, end of the year,
randomly wandering.</font>

139
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Jeff.
Are you two...?</font>

140
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No. The two of you aren't...?</font>

141
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

142
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, just friends.
Same here.</font>

143
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good for you.</font>

00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I see you at the dance, Britta?</font>

145
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of obligated, seeing
as I'm nominated for queen, so...</font>

146
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I thought you were all
into female empowerment.</font>

147
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's more empowering
than a woman in a crown?</font>

148
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just did my first keg stand.</font>

149
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha. Can't feel my legs. Uhn.</font>

00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:35,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">‚ô™ Dancing in your underwear ‚ô™</font>

154
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo! Ha-ha.</font>

155
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:51,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our original school song by the
venerable Pierce Hawthorne. Ha.</font>

156
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made that up. Hmm?</font>

157
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone remember
to vote before the coronation.</font>

158
00:07:56,914 --> 00:08:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nominees are identified with sashes
that say, "Tranny Queen." Ha-ha.</font>

159
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way,
we do offer summer classes,</font>

160
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">which are a great way to, um...</font>

161
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... Broaden your mind. Have fun.</font>

162
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. You're here for me.
Guys. Guys.</font>

163
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaughn got recruited
to a college in Delaware.</font>

164
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go with him
for the summer.</font>

165
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally. A classic
last-day-of-school plot twist.</font>

166
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:22,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna be the next
Vngwe Mackadangdang, Jr.</font>

167
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Hacky Sack guy.</font>

168
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:26,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you don't have to tell us
who Ingmar Mackadingdong, Jr. Is.</font>

169
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.
Jeff, help me</font>

170
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">with some refreshments.</font>

171
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't tell anyone
until after I'm gone.</font>

172
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not just going to Delaware
for the summer.</font>

173
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm transferring with Vaughn.</font>

174
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? When did you decide that?</font>

175
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent three months
researching backpacks</font>

176
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I chose the one
that I use now.</font>

177
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be that person
anymore.</font>

178
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:52,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to live in the moment.</font>

179
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:57,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, for your and Vaughn's sake,
I hope it works out.</font>

180
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">But on behalf of the rest of the group,
I hope it's a catastrophe.</font>

181
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:04,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better visit.
Whoa.</font>

182
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
nobody's taken this cookie.</font>

183
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:13,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Se√±or Chang,
is there a word in Spanish</font>

184
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">for someone who used to pretend
to be a professor</font>

185
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:18,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">but was a teacher,
but wasn't actually a teacher,</font>

186
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:19,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">and is now a student?</font>

187
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a word for that? Oh.</font>

188
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:25,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it was in Spanish, you wouldn't
know, would you? Bup-bup-bup.</font>

189
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit a professor, you'll get expelled.</font>

190
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will find a loophole.</font>

191
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:33,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Good luck with that.
Then I'll kill you.</font>

192
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dudley Moore.
Spray tan.</font>

193
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd go easy on that punch if I was you.
I've put in a little...</font>

194
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot person, hot people.</font>

195
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two of them coming this way.
Which one do you want?</font>

196
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Jeff.
Hi, Jeff.</font>

197
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Ha-ha.
Oh.</font>

198
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:52,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you look great,
such a stunning improvement.</font>

199
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, you look gorgeous.
It must've taken all day.</font>

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff, you've got a...</font>

201
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:02,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. It's right there.
I do? What?</font>

202
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys, cleanest face ever.</font>

203
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:08,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, am I okay?</font>

204
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Yeah.</font>

205
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:14,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Troy, uh, our study group,
after all we've been through,</font>

206
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">we got to stick together.</font>

207
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, me, and Jeff and Rain Man,</font>

208
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:23,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">and big boobs and medium boobs
and black boobs, we're a family.</font>

209
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your point?</font>

210
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been looking at your situation,
and I'd like to make an offer.</font>

211
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:28,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

212
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I black boobs?</font>

213
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last call.</font>

214
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study over.</font>

215
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Just giving things a finale vibe.</font>

216
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:53,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how's this for a finale vibe?</font>

217
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:56,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce asked me to move in with him,
in his mansion.</font>

218
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">More of a spin-off vibe,
but you should do it.</font>

219
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were friends.
We are.</font>

220
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:03,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best friends, that's why
we shouldn't be roommates.</font>

221
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll end up fighting and putting a masking
tape line down the middle of our room.</font>

222
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just won't get masking tape.</font>

223
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy. You should live
with someone who you like</font>

224
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:13,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">but whose friendship wouldn't be altered
because of constant irritation, that's Pierce.</font>

225
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:15,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you and I move in,
we jump the shark. That will end it.</font>

226
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're ending it.</font>

227
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:22,174
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, and for the record, there was
an episode of Happy Days,</i></font>

228
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">where a guy
literally jumped over a shark,</font>

229
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was the best one.</font>

230
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm winning.</font>

231
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:35,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winning tranny queen.
Yeah.</font>

232
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:39,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, isn't it nice that Jeff and
Slater are getting back together?</font>

233
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Aha. And psych.</font>

234
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they will get back together if
you don't stop competing with her</font>

235
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">and start communicating with Jeff.</font>

236
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:50,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">She already has a head start.
They slept together.</font>

237
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy macaroni with pepper jack.</font>

238
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:55,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">When? Where?</font>

239
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">During paintball in the study room
with Colonel Mustard.</font>

240
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:02,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it matter?
Well, now it does matter.</font>

241
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:03,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where... Where
in the study room?</font>

242
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:05,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the couches.</font>

243
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">We use those.
Oh, get over it.</font>

244
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you shake the dean's hand.
Who knows where he's been?</font>

245
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe in soul mates? Oh.
Uh-huh.</font>

246
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:17,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, okay.
Now, don't be mad at me.</font>

247
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think that more than
one person would answer the ad.</font>

248
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, dream coming true.</font>

249
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are leaving already?
Yeah.</font>

250
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:26,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to be in Delaware
by tomorrow night.</font>

251
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:29,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

252
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you soon.</font>

253
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good summer.</font>

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you in the fall, Annie.</font>

255
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
Heh.</font>

256
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna miss you.</font>

257
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You're the one that didn't
even want me in the study group.</font>

258
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, that's not true.
Yeah, none of us did.</font>

259
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say things others won't.
That has value.</font>

260
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, bye.</font>

261
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you. Lates.</font>

262
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.
Take care.</font>

263
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:05,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later. Good to know you.
Hang 10.</font>

264
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:07,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, Michelle.</font>

265
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or may I say, Meow-chelle?</font>

266
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:12,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who has your car keys?
They're in the taco meat.</font>

267
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what say you and I
blow this pop stand,</font>

268
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">and head off
for a spot of slap and tickle?</font>

269
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean sex, in case the
lingo hasn't made it to the States.</font>

270
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm probably leaving here
with Jeff.</font>

271
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
I'm sorry, I just assumed that you two were done,</font>

272
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:29,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">since, uh, ahem, Jeff and Britta did the...
The yankee doodle.</font>

273
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't tell me that didn't make it to the States.
It clearly originated here.</font>

274
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we finished tallying all
36 votes, so everyone get ready.</font>

275
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Goldilocks. Drop the smirk.</font>

276
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:49,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know about your grungy tumble, and I'm
sure it was the highlight of your diary</font>

277
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was during a pit stop
in something real.</font>

278
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were the pit stop.</font>

279
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used you to numb the pain
of not getting with me.</font>

280
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:58,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff needs a girl who doesn't
just not wear underwear</font>

281
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Oprah told her
it would spice things up,</font>

282
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:04,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">he needs a girl who doesn't wear underwear
because she hasn't done laundry in three weeks.</font>

283
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been to flavor country now.</font>

284
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should retire the table
we did it on.</font>

285
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:12,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Table?
Miss Britta Perry.</font>

286
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go.</font>

287
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:16,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just won a contest for being hot.</font>

288
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow.</font>

289
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:22,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a huge honor.</font>

290
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">This may come
as a surprise to you,</font>

291
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've never actually won
anything before.</font>

292
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, you still haven't.
Uh...</font>

293
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just listing the nominees,
so, not a great time to get cocky.</font>

294
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Christine Hollinsworth.</font>

295
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britney Baker.</font>

296
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:42,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Danielle Harman.</font>

297
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amy Sm...</font>

298
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:51,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger,
do not get back with Slater.</font>

299
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

300
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst, psst. Britta. Britta.</font>

301
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:04,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lipstick looks better.</font>

302
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:18,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man. How's it going?</font>

303
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Don't shoot the messenger
but everyone at this dance</font>

304
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:24,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">is kind of waiting
for your reaction to all this.</font>

305
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:26,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm trying to think, okay?</font>

306
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's cool. Take your time.</font>

307
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:30,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how's it going? You look great.</font>

308
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,107
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Very Fatal Attraction.</i></font>

309
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
Uhn.</font>

310
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you?
I'm sick.</font>

311
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why.</font>

312
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you considered the 60-inch
diameter cookie you're eating?</font>

313
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can something that's delicious
make me sick?</font>

314
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:52,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless too much of a good thing
is actually a bad thing.</font>

315
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friendship with Abed
is a giant cookie.</font>

316
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kinda got my own thing
going on now.</font>

317
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, absolutely.</font>

318
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:14,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all, I'm flattered.</font>

319
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second,
have you ever heard of e-mail?</font>

320
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love me?</font>

321
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you love me?</font>

322
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:27,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something to say.</font>

323
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:32,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I love you.</font>

324
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder where she got that from.
I'm sorry.</font>

325
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a patent
on loving people?</font>

326
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like a patent
in getting your ass kicked?</font>

327
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ack-uh-duh-buh-dee.
Okay, okay.</font>

328
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you stand over there?</font>

329
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:48,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">And can you sit down, please?</font>

330
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:58,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, choose Britta.</font>

331
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Team Britta.
Britta's lame.</font>

332
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Team Slater.</font>

333
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring Conan back.</font>

334
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:09,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been, uh, a great year.</font>

335
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't hear you.
No one can hear you.</font>

336
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:16,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna sneak right up here
and give you this, okay?</font>

337
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Hi, it's, uh...</font>

338
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on,
who are you choosing?</font>

339
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I don't know.
Oh.</font>

340
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:37,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Jeffrey.</font>

341
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody close their faces.</font>

342
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, he's got a lot on his mind.
Leave him alone.</font>

343
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:45,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it from here.</font>

344
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:51,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Professor lan Duncan,
and I would like to rap for you.</font>

345
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:53,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Drop a beat.</font>

346
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no beat.
Uh-oh.</font>

347
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">‚ô™ My name is lan Duncan
And I'm here to say ‚ô™</font>

348
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">‚ô™ I'm going to rap to the beat
In a rapping way ‚ô™</font>

349
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:03,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">‚ô™ I've got a real big penis
And I drink lots of tea ‚ô™‚ô™</font>

350
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. No, no.
You know what, Duncan?</font>

351
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough. You have a problem.
What? Why?</font>

352
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:08,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I have a problem?
Yes.</font>

353
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is it here
who has a Dalmatian fetish?</font>

354
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:12,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. Okay.</font>

355
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that is an oversimplification,
and you are suspended.</font>

356
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.
You're not a teacher anymore.</font>

357
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?
A roll of quarters. Why?</font>

358
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:23,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny question.</font>

359
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends, help me, friends.</font>

360
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it. I'll move in with you.</font>

361
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:30,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantastic, buddy.</font>

362
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:33,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come over on Saturday?
My tailor will fit you for a uniform.</font>

363
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull him out. Pull him out.</font>

364
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you left.</font>

365
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't go.
What happened?</font>

366
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:12,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess as we were driving away,
I finally started living in the moment</font>

367
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:16,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I realized that, in the moment,
Greendale is where I belong.</font>

368
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing out here?</font>

369
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know, Britta and Slater
told me they loved me.</font>

370
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
Yeah.</font>

371
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:27,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?
I ran away.</font>

372
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. It's hard.</font>

373
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slater makes me feel like I do when
I write my New Year's resolutions.</font>

374
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">She makes me feel
like the guy I want to be.</font>

375
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Britta makes me feel like the guy
I am three weeks after New Year's,</font>

376
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I'm back to hitting my snooze
button and screening Mom's phone calls,</font>

377
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">back to who I really am.</font>

378
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:49,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you try to evolve or do
you try to know what you are?</font>

379
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:52,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

380
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could live two lives.</font>

381
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:57,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of me would go with Vaughn,
and one of me could stay here.</font>

382
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. One of me be back with Slater,
the other could try it with Britta.</font>

383
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we could all get together
for some weird foursome.</font>

384
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I guess I gotta go deal with it.</font>

385
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.
Heh.</font>

386
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... I'm glad you're staying.</font>

387
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. I'm finally popular
enough to be in the yearbook.</font>

388
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean video yearbook?
Where do I sign?</font>

389
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:49,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Photo not available.</font>

390
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">This better not be one of those
take-your-top-off videos.</font>

391
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe in yearbooks.</font>

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want people to remember
there's a guy in between these things.</font>

393
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:00,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. What a year.
Only two pregnancy scares.</font>

394
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:04,098
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I give this year a D for delightful.</i></font>

395
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:09,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I spent ten bucks on this.
I don't know any of these people.</font>
