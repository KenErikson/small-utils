00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:14,651
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But remember, Cupid's face
is magic marker on nylon,</i></font>

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,349
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so love is not only blind but also
dizzy and a little belligerent.</i></font>

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm chaperoning tomorrow's dance.</font>

7
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:24,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should come.
Maybe your study buds will go.</font>

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:27,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the blonde's name?
Bitter, Butter, Beetlejuice?</font>

9
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta. Yeah, she says Valentine's
Day ritualizes a connection</font>

10
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">between affection and candy so girls
can learn the ropes of prostitution.</font>

11
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Translation, no date.</font>

12
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna join you at that dance.</font>

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as a novice boyfriend, could I
get a map of the minefield known as</font>

14
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">women's Valentine expectations?</font>

15
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day of the year, I want
you to do what makes you happy.</font>

16
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, I'm gonna be
happy spending the night</font>

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,652

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's the Cupid Being.
Ooh!</font>

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it has arrows. That's safe.</font>

27
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It's from that cook with the
long beard in the cafeteria.</font>

28
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess when he said,</font>

29
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm gonna get you,"</font>

30
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, he meant chocolates.</font>

31
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">A flower from Vaughn.
He's away on a vision quest.</font>

32
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got something, Abed?</font>

33
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another muffin basket
from another actress</font>

34
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wants to be in my next film.
Does that work?</font>

35
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. Meryl Streep has two Oscars
because of her baking.</font>

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's sarcasm
but I forgot to inflect.</font>

37
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">This sounds
way more like sarcasm.</font>

38
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inflection is so interesting.</font>

39
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">That big bag at the bottom.
Is that for me?</font>

40
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything in there for Troy?
Troy Barnes.</font>

41
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,709

Oh, good.</font>

43
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it has arrows. That's safe.</font>

44
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.</font>

45
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you look very early.
Oh, God, I'm really late.</font>

46
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are.
Yeah. See you later.</font>

47
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all right. We'll see you guys.</font>

48
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:23,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get you something?
Water? Smelling salts?</font>

49
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">An alibi for Cobain's suicide?</font>

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but you could help yourself
to a shorter forehead,</font>

51
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">a non-Keebler nose,
and shutting up.</font>

52
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. That stings.
I mean, not the words.</font>

53
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">The clouds of bourbon vapor
forming them.</font>

54
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. A girlfriend from
my anarchist days was in town</font>

55
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we drank. Everything.</font>

56
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And then you said,
"I should call Jeff."</font>

57
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:50,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, because the first thing I do
when I'm having fun is think about...</font>

58
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,131
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff Winger, I am calling you.</i></font>

59
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,107
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're probably, whatever.</i></font>

60
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,177
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So, what's up?</i></font>

61
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">The drunk dial.</font>

62
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much subtext.
So much intrigue.</font>

63
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much of what the kids
are calling BCI.</font>

64
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, uh,
Booty Call Implication.</font>

65
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

66
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to Britta?
Justice.</font>

67
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having spent the year denying her
attraction to me just to be alternative,</font>

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta called me at 3 a.m.
just to ask, "What's up?"</font>

69
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drunk dial? Was it BCI?</font>

70
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Booty call with a capital B.</font>

71
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. This can't be good.
It's no biggie.</font>

72
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">We give each other crap
all the time.</font>

73
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's the point. What crap can
she give now that you hold the cards?</font>

74
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:45,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shifted the balance like in a sitcom
when one character sees another one naked.</font>

75
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really a sitcom staple?</font>

76
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:52,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm Abed, I never watch TV.</font>

77
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we all know that in English, the
rooster says "cock-a-doodle-doo."</font>

78
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,608
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In espa√±ol, the gallo says:</i></font>

79
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I'm teaching.</font>

80
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha! I knew you were holding back.</font>

81
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:28,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It's from the girl I'm dating.</font>

82
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I met her in biology.</font>

83
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was looking for geology
and misread the sign.</font>

84
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I said, "We do not study
countries in here." Heh.</font>

85
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:39,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she's...
She's dumb, but... But sweet.</font>

86
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, mine's from Danielle.
She's, uh... Uh...</font>

87
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:45,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lovely lady
in my marketing class.</font>

88
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:46,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sleeping together.</font>

89
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sound like very lucky ladies.</font>

90
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they're not made up.</font>

91
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep-beep! Oh, my God,
what's going on? Beep-beep-beep!</font>

92
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">My bull crap meter's going crazy.</font>

93
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:59,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!</font>

94
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's these presents
you've obviously sent yourselves</font>

95
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:05,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make it look like
you have girlfriends.</font>

96
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous.</font>

97
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is obviously your handwriting,
Mr. Tremor.</font>

98
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yours is signed, "Love, Troy"?</font>

99
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you, this is the most pathetic
thing I've ever seen in the classroom.</font>

100
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him over there,
cutting the gristle off his steak</font>

101
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:27,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">as ruthlessly as he cut off
Troy and Pierce's dignity.</font>

102
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew! Now he's eating the gristle.</font>

103
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sick of Chang.
Always tearing people down,</font>

104
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">making them feel horrible
about themselves.</font>

105
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody needs to humiliate him
the way he humiliated our boys.</font>

106
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mustache, get me a juice box.</font>

107
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.
And that somebody is us.</font>

108
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:49,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can vomit onto this food
because it already smells like it.</font>

109
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh-heh. Yeah, totally.
Heh-heh-heh.</font>

110
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">My law firm went on a retreat
to Disney World once,</font>

111
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got so drunk that I got into
a fight with animatronic Ben Franklin.</font>

112
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you telling me this?</font>

113
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:06,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the point is
that when I'm sober,</font>

114
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't secretly hate Ben Franklin
or even think about him,</font>

115
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you drunk dialing me?</font>

116
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:14,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like a big deal.
My God. You're pitying me now.</font>

117
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:18,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're acting really weird.
I'll talk to you in class, okay?</font>

118
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just leave me alone till then.</font>

119
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep-beep-beep!</font>

120
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on here?</font>

121
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!</font>

122
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">My doody meter's going crazy.</font>

123
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cut, cut, cut.
Leo, I'm not feeling it.</font>

124
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really need to believe that you're
holding an imaginary doody meter.</font>

125
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is not me.
It's you and your stupid script.</font>

126
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot.</font>

127
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the anger. Use it.</font>

128
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:47,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
One Papa John's commercial</font>

129
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he thinks he's Christian Bale.</font>

130
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, uh, you were right.</font>

131
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta is totally weird around me.
It does feel like I saw her naked.</font>

132
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a resonant premise.
Tony even saw Angela naked</font>

133
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,006
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>on the opening credits
of Who's the Boss?</i></font>

134
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did Tony do
something to fix that?</font>

135
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I could never
get past the opening credits.</font>

136
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,143
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But when Chandler
saw Rachel naked on Friends,</i></font>

137
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">to even the score Rachel needed
to see Chandler's penis.</font>

138
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'll show Britta my penis.</font>

139
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, please don't waste my time.
I lose my Chang to Cub Scouts in 20 minutes.</font>

140
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... So, what? To even the score,
I have to drunk dial her?</font>

141
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that absurdly simplistic?
Would it even work?</font>

142
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and maybe. Oh.</font>

143
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:23,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">No room for error.
She'd have to believe it was real.</font>

144
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever acted drunk before?</font>

145
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:26,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can totally do it.</font>

146
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:30,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine. I can drive.
I can totally drive right now.</font>

147
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me my keys.
That's enough.</font>

148
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, hold on a second.
All right.</font>

149
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.</font>

150
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, seriously, give me my keys.</font>

151
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's a wrap, people.</font>

152
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to be at my
place at 4 so we can work on this.</font>

153
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no, I can't do that.
Here's why.</font>

154
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbest idea ever.</font>

155
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you know Britta's defining weakness.
She cuts and runs.</font>

156
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do this half-assed and fail, she
may leave, then we all lose her.</font>

157
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.</font>

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a deal breaker. Saddle up.</font>

159
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I lost my cool.
Just quit smoking.</font>

160
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,415
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kid's gonna be a star. He's a young
"the Asian guy from Lost."</i></font>

161
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try it again.</font>

162
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. You're a big guy.</font>

163
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Action.</font>

164
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Britta.
Your call got me thinking,</font>

165
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:22,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">and thinking got me drinking.</font>

166
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:23,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. That was terrible.</font>

167
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Mm-mm.</font>

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I can get drunk alone
if that's what helps people act.</font>

169
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:31,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's your problem, Jeff.
You've been acting your whole life. Okay?</font>

170
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:34,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to pass that act up
and find the actor playing you.</font>

171
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:36,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they are gonna love you
in California.</font>

172
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like Britta?</font>

173
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, who doesn't?
Over half the people that meet her.</font>

174
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can be put off
by her vacuous mannequin face,</font>

175
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">and her Jodie Foster severity.</font>

176
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:50,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're different.
Uh...</font>

177
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.
She's no barrel of monkeys.</font>

178
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">She... She wants everyone to be
honest but she lies to herself.</font>

179
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's seen the world
but doesn't get it.</font>

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has more fights about stuff
that doesn't matter</font>

181
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">than a YouTube comment section.</font>

182
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:07,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's passionate, which I
find stupid but entertaining.</font>

183
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attractive?</font>

184
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was only attraction at first</font>

185
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:11,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she bothered to play
hard to get.</font>

186
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:16,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm happy with Michelle.
- Yeah, Slater is low maintenance.</font>

187
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lowest.</font>

188
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, irritating, impossible, unpredictable,
and she didn't like you,</font>

189
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">so it felt useless to like her.</font>

190
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:25,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slater likes you how you are, expects nothing
from you. You're safe from change.</font>

191
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">And passion.</font>

192
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:28,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it.
Watch what?</font>

193
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">A phony drunk-dial soaked in phony
pity that insults Britta even more?</font>

194
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a believable performance
informed by feeling?</font>

195
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:41,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I am sure
you're a good director,</font>

196
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you are a horrible
drinking buddy.</font>

197
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can't feel things
with you studying me</font>

198
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a beige praying mantis.</font>

199
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

200
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you never drank.
Scorsese drank with De Niro.</font>

201
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not for me.
It's for the audience.</font>

202
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, class, turn to page...
Whoa.</font>

203
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like the law firm
of Seacrest and Slumdog</font>

204
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:05,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">is taking the day off.</font>

205
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:09,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Another special delivery</font>

206
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:12,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Troy and Pierce's
imaginary lovers?</font>

207
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. Uhn.</font>

208
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one's for me. Heh-heh-heh.</font>

209
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:24,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Oh, yeah. Huh. Chh-chh.</font>

210
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. It's from Princeton.</font>

211
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to make me
associate professor</font>

212
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the Spanish Department?</font>

213
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're telling me
I can name my price? Oh, my God.</font>

214
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">At Princeton? Come on.</font>

215
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:44,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two idiots really thought
I'd fall for this, huh?</font>

216
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your pathetic attempt
to punish me for humiliating you.</font>

217
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we didn't do it.
Save it.</font>

218
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">As punishment, because you two
obviously don't have any girlfriends,</font>

219
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:03,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">escort me to the Valentine's Dance
wearing elegant ladies' pantsuits.</font>

220
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, right.</font>

221
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll do it or you fail my class.</font>

222
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do that.
Have you met me?</font>

223
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:14,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean it.
Tonight, you are my bitches.</font>

224
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

225
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

226
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

227
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:41,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 3:00.</font>

228
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

229
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last thing I remember</font>

230
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:49,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">is you were dancing
like that girl in the movie</font>

231
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,852
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kids In Detention?
Breakfast Club?</i></font>

232
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God.
What have you done to me?</font>

233
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, did I call Britta?</font>

234
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my phone?
Got it.</font>

235
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:05,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made two outgoing calls.</font>

236
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">One to Britta, one to your girlfriend.</font>

237
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember either of them.</font>

238
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither do I.</font>

239
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,767
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I don't remember the name
of the girl in The Breakfast Club.</i></font>

240
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary.</font>

241
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaret.</font>

242
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:22,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Molly Ringworm?</font>

243
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke me.</font>

244
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still can't believe I'm a size 14.</font>

245
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:36,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the 12 was a little tight
but I could have pulled it off.</font>

246
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys really going through
with this?</font>

247
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to. He'll fail us.</font>

248
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're gonna find out who wrote
that letter. We have leads.</font>

249
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It was written on fake Princeton letterhead.
So whoever wrote it,</font>

250
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">worked at Princeton,
ran out of stationary,</font>

251
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">and didn't have time
to go to the store.</font>

252
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:53,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, you guys?
Uh-uh! Uh.</font>

253
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

254
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women's sizes run slimmer.</font>

255
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:01,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're a 12 everywhere
that it counts.</font>

256
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll take every little victory
I can get right now.</font>

257
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:09,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look about ready
to marry Courtney Love.</font>

258
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:13,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the reverse of my zinger
from before.</font>

259
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:16,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, please stop shouting, all right?
I feel like that person in that TV show.</font>

260
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember calling me
last night?</font>

261
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Why?</font>

262
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we cool?
Oh, yeah.</font>

263
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:28,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a seat, Drunky Brewster.
Let's study.</font>

264
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:31,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, balance restored, I guess.</font>

265
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Movie reference.</font>

266
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there.</font>

267
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Valentine's Day.</font>

268
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been calling you.
Yeah, I know.</font>

269
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured I'd just let it go to voicemail
in case you had the wrong number again.</font>

270
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elaborate?
Oh, you don't remember</font>

271
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">calling me at 4 in the morning</font>

272
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:07,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hanging up
when you realized I wasn't Britta?</font>

273
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess not.</font>

274
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michelle.</font>

275
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michelle, um,</font>

276
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:18,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to call Britain
to order you toffees.</font>

277
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that might sound dumb,</font>

278
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I needed to open with it
to make the truth less ridiculous.</font>

279
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two nights ago,
Britta drunk-dialed me,</font>

280
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it embarrassed her
and made her sad,</font>

281
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only way for her
to get her power back</font>

282
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">was for me to get believably drunk
and leave her</font>

283
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">an equally
embarrassing message.</font>

284
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sure seems like you and Britta
are friends</font>

285
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way my mom's pool cleaner
was my uncle.</font>

286
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you had sex with her?
Not even a little.</font>

287
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">What doesn't make sense is
that you did all this work</font>

288
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:53,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">to put a smile on her face
but can't pick up ice cream</font>

289
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,893
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>for Law and Order night
because it feels too marriage-y.</i></font>

290
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all, Chubby Hubby?</font>

291
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, could you pick
a scarier flavor?</font>

292
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:05,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk about this later.
I need to chaperone something.</font>

293
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is. Oh.</font>

294
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I thought I'd be embarrassed.
Now I'm just scared.</font>

295
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am seriously reconsidering how
much I want this language credit.</font>

296
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:37,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what we said?</font>

297
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never let him see us cry.</font>

298
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:42,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

299
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:45,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, one, two...</font>

300
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
Keep your coats on.</font>

301
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the ones that sent
the letter to Chang.</font>

302
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

303
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work...
You work at Princeton?</font>

304
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were mad at him
for humiliating you.</font>

305
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:58,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, nice fix, Tweedledum
and even Tweedlerdum.</font>

306
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're gonna tell Chang
the truth,</font>

307
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll pay the price.</font>

308
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

309
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't make you do that.
No, he's right.</font>

310
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">First we gotta get out of these
pantsuits then you can put them on.</font>

311
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Pierce, this whole thing started
because you and I were ashamed</font>

312
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">we didn't have ladies
that cared about us.</font>

313
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the good news is
we obviously do.</font>

314
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:26,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bad news is that it makes it our
manly duty to protect them tonight.</font>

315
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
That's nice</font>

316
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we really can't let you do that.</font>

317
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's right. He's right.</font>

318
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:35,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside.
Oh.</font>

319
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's handle this like men.
Yeah.</font>

320
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo. Ladies.</font>

321
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to be okay, right?
Get in my Mercedes.</font>

322
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look away, baby.</font>

323
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look away.</font>

324
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.
Looking for someone?</font>

325
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

326
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slater.
Heh.</font>

327
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very funny.</font>

328
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when you called me last
night and invited me to the dance,</font>

329
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was shocked.</font>

330
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thrilled.</font>

331
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

332
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

333
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

334
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry.</font>

335
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:47,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't... I don't remember asking you to the dance.
I don't remember anything.</font>

336
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now Slater knows about
all the drunk-dialing stuff,</font>

337
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:53,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm in the doghouse.
And if she finds out about this, it's over.</font>

338
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:56,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, again, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.</font>

339
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are messing with me
right now, aren't you?</font>

340
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:02,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you didn't remember anything
from that phone call last night.</font>

341
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:06,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got dressed up
just to see me sweat?</font>

342
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, believe me. You're worth it.</font>

343
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Just chaperoning.
Enjoy the dance.</font>

344
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:11,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Michelle.</font>

345
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, what's left to say?</font>

346
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... I... I don't know.</font>

347
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...
I do.</font>

348
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it last night.</font>

349
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:31,319
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So look, I am really into Michelle.</i></font>

350
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I don't wanna screw it up.
She's a perfect girlfriend.</i></font>

351
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,856
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I want you to be
as happy as me</i></font>

352
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:41,555
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>because you're, like, my favorite
friend, so... Ha-ha-ha.</i></font>

353
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,861
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm sorry.
Abed just made a turtle face.</i></font>

354
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:49,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">In his defense,
Abed's turtle face is really funny.</font>

355
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Britta.
Yeah, thanks.</font>

356
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

357
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the first 20 seconds
of a 40-minute message.</font>

358
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:02,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very informative.</font>

359
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:08,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Valentine's Day,
perfect boyfriend.</font>

360
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's me.</font>

361
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:30,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I cannot wait to get out
of these ridiculous outfits.</font>

362
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woof! I know, yeah.</font>

363
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
I'm parked over here.</font>

364
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, well... Uh...</font>

365
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh-heh.
Come on.</font>

366
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... What the hell is this?</font>

367
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to get
frozen yogurt. Aah.</font>

368
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gay, man.
They close in seven minutes.</font>

369
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have driven you.</font>

370
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said he hated fro-yo.</font>

371
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just drive.</font>

372
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slut!</font>
