00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, everybody.
Hi, Jeff.</font>

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought bagels.
Oh, I'd love a bagel.</font>

3
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:14,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">The perfect beginning
for my first day of billiards class.</font>

4
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Did you pick a special outfit so
you could look sexy shooting pool?</font>

5
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I have no idea
what you are talking about.</font>

6
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh.</font>

7
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen.
Oh, great, so much for "baggles."</font>

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much for what?</font>

9
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:29,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">The "baggles."
You dropped them on the floor.</font>

10
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:32,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, they're called "bay-gels."</font>

11
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:35,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I lived in New York, Troy.
I know what a "baggle" is.</font>

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is wrong with you?
What?</font>

13
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:40,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say "bagel" wrong.</font>

14
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say it the same as you.</font>

15
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it again.</font>

16
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Baggle."</font>

17
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:51,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just keep studying?
We're on page 258.</font>

18
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">What "padge" was that?
Two-five-tee-eight. Heh.</font>

19
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:59,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Check this out.
Uh-oh.</font>

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's a drawing of Abed
with hearts all around it.</font>

21
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strictly speaking, Troy, the Bible
condemns this level of friendship.</font>

22
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't draw that.</font>

23
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bought that used.
Must have been whoever had it last.</font>

24
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, it's a girl
who has a crush on Abed.</font>

25
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so romantic.</font>

26
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,050
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's just like The Notebook, except
instead of Alzheimer's, Abed has...</i></font>

27
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:21,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. Mm-hm.
Someone who likes him.</font>

28
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:22,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whoever she is, she's fat.</font>

29
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">These thick pencil lines
were drawn with a heavy hand.</font>

30
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta find this person for Abed.</font>

31
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless it's a boy,
then we find him for Jesus.</font>

32
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">But either way,
this is going to be fun.</font>

33
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cute little face.</font>

34
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:55,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, class is over.</font>

35
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to get you to leave.</font>

36
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

37
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick that up.
Señor Chang?</font>

39
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:07,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to figure out whose
Spanish book this was before Troy's.</font>

40
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:22,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would have started using
birth control centuries ago.</font>

41
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name's in the front
of the book, morons.</font>

42
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:27,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay. He's right.</font>

43
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Them I understand.
But how did you not think of that?</font>

44
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:34,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have been thrown off by Britta's
pronunciation of the word "bagel."</font>

45
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you pronounce bagel?
I don't.</font>

46
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Ugh.
"Baggle."</font>

47
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst.</font>

48
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we have a name.</font>

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jenny Adams.
Cool.</font>

50
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:47,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, it's a fat girl's name.
Might as well be Gravy Jones.</font>

51
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, it doesn't matter
what she looks like.</font>

52
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:52,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will be great for Abed.
It will?</font>

53
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you excited
about talking to her?</font>

54
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:56,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't planning on it.
What?</font>

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, come on, you heard Abed.
He's not interested. Drop it.</font>

56
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you need to mind
your own business.</font>

57
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:04,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you need to get with this girl,
immediately, if not sooner.</font>

58
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
Abed, for guys like you,</font>

59
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">this kind of opportunity
only comes around once in a life...</font>

60
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">While.</font>

61
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:13,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's important to date
in college, Abed.</font>

62
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a time of freedom
and exploration.</font>

63
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:19,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">A time when a simple pillow fight
between two innocent girls</font>

64
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:22,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">could turn to a steamy night
of unbridled lust.</font>

65
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:26,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta knows all about it.</font>

66
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,080
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay. Cool. So you guys are gonna
Can't Buy Me Love me, right?</i></font>

67
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,311
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're gonna what you?
You're gonna Can't Buy Me Love me.</i></font>

68
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:34,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, transform me
from zero to hero, geek to chic.</font>

69
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:36,317
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, he wants us to
Love Don't Cost a Thing him.</i></font>

70
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:37,891
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh.
Can't Buy Me Love</i></font>

71
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the remake
for white audiences.</font>

72
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so uncomfortable
when they do that.</font>

73
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:43,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe it doesn't
insult them.</font>

74
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:47,193
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All right, nobody here
is Can't Buy Me Love-ing</i></font>

75
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,338
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>or Love Don't Cost a Thing-ing
anyone.</i></font>

76
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we've all seen enough
after-school specials</font>

77
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,371
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and Fat Albert to know
Oh.</i></font>

78
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:57,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Abed only needs
to be himself.</font>

79
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure glad
there are no old people here.</font>

80
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:04,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">This conversation would probably
be total gibberish to them.</font>

81
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:07,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's unprecedentedly right
about this.</font>

82
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, when we find this girl,
you're gonna approach her</font>

83
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">just the way you are.
Because that's good enough.</font>

84
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:16,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Then you can take her to a nice
deli and treat her to a "baggle."</font>

85
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

86
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

87
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:41,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, nice shooting.
Good clean strokes.</font>

88
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:45,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
Form a line, please.</font>

89
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Coach Bogner.</font>

90
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the Art of Pool,</font>

91
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:56,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is a phys ed class.</font>

92
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means that you all have to wear
the proper equipment at all times.</font>

93
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So suit up.
See you back on the felt in 5.</font>

94
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. You're gonna look
like an ass in those.</font>

95
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Leonard.</font>

96
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:14,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to your son on Family Day.
I know all about your gambling.</font>

97
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Touché.</font>

98
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:22,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody just hang out
and be casual.</font>

99
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sources tell me
that Jenny Adams is the blonde</font>

100
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's reading right over there.</font>

101
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! That's her? She's pretty.</font>

102
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is not a surprise at all, Abed.</font>

103
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Abed, we're gonna be here
for moral support.</font>

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go over there, do your thing.</font>

105
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Remember, be yourself.</font>

106
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it. Cool.
Great.</font>

107
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Yeah?</font>

108
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
I'm being myself.</font>

109
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go be yourself by Jenny.</font>

110
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wouldn't go over there.
How do you know that?</font>

111
00:05:58,835 --> 00:05:59,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lifetime of observation mostly.</font>

112
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, do you think there's a version
of yourself that might go over there?</font>

113
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.
Could you be him?</font>

114
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

115
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

116
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

117
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:21,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">A different version of me.
I think he was a vampire.</font>

118
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. If this is gonna turn ugly,
I can't be here. I'm a two-striker.</font>

119
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Pierce, please, hang on.</font>

120
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, will you excuse us, please?
Yeah.</font>

121
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know that
we're all good people.</font>

122
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:36,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">And good people believe
that people should be themselves.</font>

123
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if Abed is himself,
he's gonna die alone.</font>

124
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we let him be someone else...</font>

125
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.</font>

126
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out of here.</font>

127
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, there's
a midget on stilts.</font>

128
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:25,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not in uniform.
Yeah, about that.</font>

129
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">We seriously have to wear shorts
to play pool?</font>

130
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you play in this class.
It's regulation.</font>

131
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Regulation pool or regulation you?</font>

132
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have something
against playing pool</font>

133
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:37,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a full range of motion
and optimal comfort?</font>

134
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm comfortable in my own clothes.
I bet you are.</font>

135
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?
I said</font>

136
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:47,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you're comfortable dressed
like a model instead of an athlete,</font>

137
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:50,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">sipping martinis, smoking, instead
of keeping your game on the table.</font>

138
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, listen, man, you're implying
I'm some sort of pool poser</font>

139
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I don't wanna wear
a bathing suit.</font>

140
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the weird one.</font>

141
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:00,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird, not me.</font>

142
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody plays pool like that.
Yeah, what do you call this?</font>

143
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call that
your personal business, okay?</font>

144
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I call this class the desecration
of America's coolest sport.</font>

145
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:13,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. L... See, right there. Ha.
"Coolest sport."</font>

146
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I want everybody to know
what's going on here.</font>

147
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">This hipster is dropping this class</font>

148
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:24,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he cares more about what
he looks like than how he's playing.</font>

149
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:25,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.</font>

150
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one with the rules
about clothes.</font>

151
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:31,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, by the way, I could kick
your ass all over that table.</font>

152
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:33,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that a challenge?</font>

153
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:38,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Because if you play me in pool,
you play me in shorts.</font>

154
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you can't do that,
well, my point's already made.</font>

155
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:48,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have
anything to prove to you or...</font>

156
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:51,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you're stupid. This is stupid.</font>

157
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pool in shorts is stupid.</font>

158
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vanity, thy name is... his name.</font>

159
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.
It's the first day. I didn't catch it.</font>

160
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Abed, we know that, normally,
you wouldn't approach a girl.</font>

161
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you don't learn how,
you won't get Jenny.</font>

162
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah and you got two days.
Then I'm going after her.</font>

163
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.
What, I'm incentivizing him.</font>

164
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:15,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, if she's into Abed, let's face it,
anybody could hit that.</font>

165
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:18,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand, I need to change who
I am to someone more likeable.</font>

166
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:21,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, sweetie, it's not about
changing. It's about learning.</font>

167
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Learning to change?
No, it's...</font>

168
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good grief, clear the chickens
off the runway. I'll be the bad guy.</font>

169
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:29,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Abed,
you need to be someone else.</font>

170
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who, eventually,
gets a girlfriend.</font>

171
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:34,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I can't think of anything
more frightening</font>

172
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">than a half-Polish, half-Arab virgin
in his 30s.</font>

173
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">One way or the other,
that story ends with an explosion.</font>

174
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try a practice run.</font>

175
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Annie, you sit here, okay,
and be a girl.</font>

176
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:50,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you take a run at her.
Let's see what you got.</font>

177
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

178
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

179
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you reading?</font>

180
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:01,571
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Pride and Prejudice.</i></font>

181
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're familiar with two sins.</font>

182
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:10,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a third?
Oh.</font>

183
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:19,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
we're allowed to smoke in here.</font>

184
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you picked the wrong outfit,</font>

185
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't you?</font>

186
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what are you doing?</font>

187
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,200
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don Draper from Mad Men.</i></font>

188
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you think?
Awesome.</font>

189
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your tongue in her ear.
I liked it.</font>

190
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be him. He cheats on his wife.</font>

191
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:37,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be somebody nice like Mike Brady.</font>

192
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">He always had that housekeeper throwing herself at him.
He never made a move on her.</font>

193
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be Mike Brady.
Mike Brady's not sexy.</font>

194
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You should be like Jo
from Facts of Life.</i></font>

195
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know, the dude version.
I knew it.</font>

196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be like Calvin.</font>

197
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">His best friend was a tiger,
he always went on dope adventures.</font>

198
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:56,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything stood in his way,
he just peed on it.</font>

199
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calvin Coolidge?
No, you guys.</font>

200
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don Draper
was clearly the sexiest...</font>

201
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:03,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the worst thing about
it, is like that Calvin.</font>

202
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:06,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing?</font>

203
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're teaching me
to be someone else.</font>

204
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for God's sake.</font>

205
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you guys?</font>

206
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for God's sakes,
everybody, do whatever you want.</font>

207
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:15,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave each other alone.</font>

208
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, that's a good Jeff.
How'd you do that?</font>

209
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:20,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten percent Dick
Van Dyke, 20 percent Sam Malone,</font>

210
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:24,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>40 percent Zach Braff in Scrubs, and 30
percent Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry.</i></font>

211
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:26,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zach Braff?
Sorry.</font>

212
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what if you just did Jeff
for Jenny?</font>

213
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... And your point is?</font>

214
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:33,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't want any part of this.</font>

215
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't believe
tha... That you're still doing it</font>

216
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:40,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I already explained the obvious
lesson smacking you in the face.</font>

217
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, why aren't you
in billiards class?</font>

218
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:43,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't look cool in shorts.</font>

219
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Whoa!</font>

220
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:49,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Because I'm not cool in shorts.</font>

221
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:52,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that's good.
That was really good.</font>

222
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna spoil the ending but,
uh, pride ends up with prejudice.</font>

223
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:01,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's funny.
I know.</font>

224
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stick with me, and you get a laugh or two.
That's the Abed guarantee.</font>

225
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I've seen you before.</font>

226
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:13,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's working.
I know.</font>

227
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get that a lot from art students.</font>

228
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm told I have a face
made for sketching.</font>

229
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather think
it was made for kissing.</font>

230
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:24,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about for punching, huh?</font>

231
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing
hitting on my girlfriend, ugly?</font>

232
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is awkward.</font>

233
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

234
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a white Abed.</font>

235
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:37,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I know. It... It's like Abed
but employable.</font>

236
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, boss? Let's go, Slumdog.
Oh.</font>

237
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,736
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And one last Lost and
Found announcement.</i></font>

238
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:48,208
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff Winger, I've been informed
by Coach Bogner</i></font>

239
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that you left your panties
in his pool class</i></font>

240
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,212
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so better pick those up.</i></font>

241
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">When is he gonna stop doing that?</font>

242
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
that he called me a hipster?</font>

243
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hipster. Do hipsters walk around</font>

244
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">wearing $300 jeans from Italy?</font>

245
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we please talk about Abed?
Thanks to us, his heart's been broken.</font>

246
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:10,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hate to say that I told you so,
so I'll shout it through cupped hands.</font>

247
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:14,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you so.
We were only trying to help.</font>

248
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, who are we kidding?
Jeff's right.</font>

249
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:19,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed was happy being Abed
till we had to sully his mind</font>

250
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:23,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">with thoughts of love and romance
and vaginas.</font>

251
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the big three.
That's what they call them.</font>

252
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:28,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Abed. He was probably too sad
to get out of bed this morning.</font>

253
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Abed.</font>

254
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:33,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">About yesterday...
Oh, yeah.</font>

255
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:35,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys must be pretty upset.
Why would we be upset?</font>

256
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I know how important
it was for you that I get a girlfriend.</font>

257
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:41,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when Jenny went off with
white Abed, it must have really hurt.</font>

258
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:44,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. It did.
White Abed?</font>

259
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:47,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jenny's boyfriend is a white guy
that's almost identical to Abed.</font>

260
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Name is Joey and that's why
the sketch was in Troy's book.</font>

261
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">So does that make Abed
brown Joey?</font>

262
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna get racist about it.</font>

263
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you know we just want you
to be happy, right?</font>

264
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:59,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know. Everybody wants me to be happy.
Everybody wants to help me.</font>

265
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">But usually when they find out they can't,
they get frustrated and stop talking to me.</font>

266
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or they trick me into buying them ice cream
and then shove me into a clothes dryer.</font>

267
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I didn't wanna happen
with you guys</font>

268
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I wanted to make sure you felt
you could help.</font>

269
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, lots of girls like me
because, let's face it,</font>

270
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty adorable.
Mm-hm.</font>

271
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:17,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, my aloofness unconsciously
reminds them of their fathers, so...</font>

272
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more used to them
approaching me.</font>

273
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we didn't damage
your self-esteem or anything?</font>

274
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I got self-esteem
falling out of my butt.</font>

275
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I was willing
to change for you,</font>

276
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">because when you really know who you
are and what you like about yourself</font>

277
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:33,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">changing for other people
isn't such a big deal.</font>

278
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:38,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you're a god.</font>

279
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll all excuse me,</font>

280
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:47,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a man to beat in pool
while wearing shorts.</font>

281
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that code for going number one
or number two?</font>

282
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:56,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you've inspired me too.
People can mock me all they want.</font>

283
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care how
I say the word "baggle."</font>

284
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Baggle."
She said the word "baggle."</font>

285
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:08,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's play some pool.</font>

286
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, nice cross corner, Leonard.
Totally. Heh-heh.</font>

287
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to see Jeff Winger
try that shot</font>

288
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">without the benefit
of his stylish clothing.</font>

289
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, would you?</font>

290
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:19,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger.</font>

291
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be at
a Urban Outfitters?</font>

292
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:26,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go there later if I feel like it.
But first I have to hand someone</font>

293
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:29,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">their tightly polyester-swaddled ass
in a game of pool.</font>

294
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:30,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

295
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, burn.</font>

296
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, do you wanna talk
about clothes like a girl?</font>

297
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or use tapered sticks to hit balls
around a cushioned table like a man?</font>

298
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Balls, like a man.
Oh!</font>

299
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:42,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rack them.</font>

300
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:44,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll break.</font>

301
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Because it looks cool?</font>

302
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

303
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me.</font>

304
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

305
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the way.</font>

306
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh-shh, boom.</font>

307
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:29,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Let me just clean this side of the
table off here, all right? Oh, okay.</font>

308
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go. See that?
There you go. Oh, yeah.</font>

309
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. What do you think of that?
See, you haven't learned anything.</font>

310
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:38,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except how to look cool
playing pool in shorts.</font>

311
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong, man.</font>

312
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just having a good time
because I love playing pool.</font>

313
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liar.</font>

314
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you look cool.</font>

315
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

316
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:51,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how cool is this?</font>

317
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:59,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop projecting your obsession
with clothes onto me as an excuse</font>

318
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">for when I beat you
in a game of real pool.</font>

319
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you wanna play real pool, huh?</font>

320
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

321
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:07,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll play real pool.</font>

322
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:10,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now who doesn't care
how they look?</font>

323
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

324
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be stopping this?
Soon. Soon.</font>

325
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just gathering evidence.</font>

326
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three-to-one against Winger.
Who's on?</font>

327
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Oh!</font>

328
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!
Oh.</font>

329
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:50,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

330
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, Jeff?</font>

331
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us is about to win this game.</font>

332
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:01,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">But years from now,
when the story is retold,</font>

333
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">all they're gonna remember</font>

334
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">is one of us loved clothes</font>

335
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:11,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the other loved... the game.</font>

336
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:12,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

337
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:17,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

338
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:21,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

339
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

340
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...
Ooh.</font>

341
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

342
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

343
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

344
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

345
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

346
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah.</font>

347
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:21,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look at me. Look at me.</font>

348
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:22,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You beat me.</font>

349
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on, you play pool
dressed however you choose.</font>

350
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I choose shorts.</font>

351
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I choose shorts.</font>

352
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shorts.</font>

353
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:35,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch.</font>

354
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You magnificent son of a bitch.</font>

355
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:44,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

356
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:47,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was awesome.
Let me get in here. Oh!</font>

357
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:50,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you're sweaty.
All right, all right.</font>

358
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice game.
Thanks.</font>

359
00:19:57,174 --> 00:20:00,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, l... I hope this doesn't sound
too forward.</font>

360
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:04,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, um, could you introduce me
to your friend?</font>

361
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:13,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? l...
I know that guy's m.o.,</font>

362
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think it's better
if you introduce yourself.</font>

363
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

364
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:21,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Hi.</font>

365
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Courtney.
Abed.</font>

366
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:30,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, why couldn't I be Brown Joey?</font>

367
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tsk.</font>

368
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed.
Hey Troy.</font>

369
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the book I borrowed.
Thank you.</font>

370
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you finally get your own book?
Something like that.</font>

371
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:47,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second.</font>

372
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Let's have cookies.</font>

373
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:55,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

374
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Mm.
Mm. Mm.</font>

375
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cousin's funeral was today.
Oh, was that... That was today?</font>

376
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:08,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew there was some reason
I couldn't do this today.</font>

377
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:10,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Demitri.</font>
