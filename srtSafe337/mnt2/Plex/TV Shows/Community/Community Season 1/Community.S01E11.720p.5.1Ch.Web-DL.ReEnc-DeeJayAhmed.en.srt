00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:06,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I booked a sketch artist,
an improv troupe,</font>

2
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:09,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a laser projecting
a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.</font>

3
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:11,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">A laser? Well, this isn't
gonna be your mother's</font>

4
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">sexually transmitted disease
awareness fair.</font>

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been quite
the little helper, Annie.</font>

6
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:19,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">STD fair, guys. Catch knowledge.</font>

7
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're better than me?
No.</font>

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stick to quoting movie lines,
I'll stick to sports.</font>

9
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:37,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying to reduce my referencing.
Well, you're not moving into sports.</font>

10
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are playing
real basketball, right now.</font>

11
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds fun.
No, it doesn't.</font>

12
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it won't be.</font>

13
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:47,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Catch knowledge.
Sorry, not interested</font>

14
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:50,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">in ignoring your
very important cause.</font>

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.</font>

16
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.</font>

17
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secretary is a little
degrading to women.</font>

18
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I help the dean do office-y things.</font>

19
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:00,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gender saved.</font>

20
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">My casual friend and I are gonna
have a non-romantic breakfast</font>

21
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you'd like to join us.
Cafeteria's closed.</font>

22
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:08,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortune cookie?
Isn't it great?</font>

23
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:12,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is the latest campus to
catch a case of public-health fever.</font>

24
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:17,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the toilets in the women's
bathrooms don't have seats, right?</font>

25
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:20,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they keep getting stolen.
Sabrina, take a note.</font>

26
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want hidden cameras
in every stall.</font>

27
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Problem solved.</font>

28
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:28,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You will get AIDS."
Flip it over.</font>

29
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Unless you go to the STD fair."</font>

30
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote that.</font>

31
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratu... Horrible.</font>

32
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later.</font>

33
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Catch knowledge.</font>

34
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you and I are friends, right?
Okay.</font>

35
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:54,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have noticed
a recent change in my demeanor.</font>

36
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't.
Well, I have a new girlfriend.</font>

37
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is super-smart,
if you know what I mean.</font>

38
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:03,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always know what you mean.
Can't wait for you to meet her.</font>

39
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when you
catch a big fish,</font>

40
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:09,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">you wanna stuff her
and put her on the mantle.</font>

41
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about tonight?
I doubt it.</font>

42
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, Jeff and I are double-dating
tonight with my new girlfriend.</font>

43
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:24,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got that from "I doubt it"?</font>

45
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce has got a girlfriend.</font>

46
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great. What does she do?</font>

47
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's an escort.</font>

48
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

49
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some mysteries solve themselves.</font>

50
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:38,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, that's just her profession.
She doesn't escort me.</font>

51
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. I met her
in my Marketing class.</font>

52
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm taking Doreen
to Annie's mixer tonight.</font>

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean the STD fair.
Catch knowledge.</font>

54
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking a call girl to an STD fair?
There's a joke here.</font>

55
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:54,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Jeff, dust off that black book
and rustle up a honey, huh?</font>

56
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a pill that makes
the word "no" clearer?</font>

57
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:00,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it is pretty short notice.
Probably couldn't get a date anyway.</font>

58
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

59
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're right.</font>

60
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

61
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:09,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it has something to do with crabs.
They're like a food but also a disease?</font>

62
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder, Jeff,
for all your feather flashing,</font>

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">when was the last time
you actually scored?</font>

64
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:17,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know the precise date,
Pierce, because I'm not you.</font>

65
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's no receipt.</font>

66
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.
Ehh.</font>

67
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:22,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

68
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:26,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't take pot shots at some
woman because you can't get a date.</font>

69
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get dates any time I want.</font>

70
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this, some kind of joke?
No, this is.</font>

71
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Don't eat the crab dip." Yeah.</font>

72
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh! You hear that, Annie?</font>

73
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the sound of
STDs screaming,</font>

74
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">"No, stop being so aware of us."</font>

75
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's all thanks to you.</font>

76
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was voted "most likely to succeed"
at my rehab clinic.</font>

77
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in recognition
of all your hard work,</font>

78
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:57,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have decided that you should
conduct the condom demonstration.</font>

79
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be center stage
showing everyone</font>

80
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:02,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to put a condom on a, uh...</font>

81
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:04,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what my dad called
a Jimmy Carter.</font>

82
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I don't know if
I'm the right person.</font>

83
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. Not a real one.</font>

84
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:12,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's an anatomically correct
model, you know.</font>

85
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:16,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">But trust me, eyes closed,
you can't tell the difference.</font>

86
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Okay.</font>

87
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:27,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it's Jeff Winger.</font>

88
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:32,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wanted to see
what you were doing tonight.</font>

89
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I know your name?</font>

90
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of question is that?
Of course I know.</font>

91
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I answer now,</font>

92
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll never learn
a valuable lesson about trust,</font>

93
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jennifer.</font>

94
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:46,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap. Ugh.</font>

95
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce really got to you, huh?</font>

96
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:55,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has been a dry spell. But it's been a
while since I've tried. So I'm trying.</font>

97
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I can see that.
This is a lot of outgoing calls.</font>

98
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:00,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Car Wash Redhead."</font>

99
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tube Top R.E.M. Concert."</font>

100
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Juror Number 6."
That sounds above board.</font>

101
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:08,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least you have "Mommy" in here.
That's not my mom.</font>

102
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, not cool.</font>

103
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:14,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saying "dude" is not cool.</font>

104
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

105
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hot Blonde Spanish Class"?</font>

106
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:20,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

107
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the phone book
of a man in his 20s.</font>

108
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:26,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">The women literally have
no identities. It's pretty shallow.</font>

109
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

110
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I haven't
seen it before now.</font>

111
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever. I'm gonna go
study with Shirley.</font>

112
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll be here,
rethinking my way of life.</font>

113
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

114
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call "Mommy."</font>

115
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I have a problem.</font>

116
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean wants me to demonstrate
proper use of a condom</font>

117
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:55,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the stupid fair, by putting one on
a mannequin's stupid thingamabob.</font>

118
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:00,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a big honor
but I'm gonna screw it up.</font>

119
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's easy enough to practice.
Britta, do you have a banana?</font>

120
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an anatomically correct model
I'll be handling.</font>

121
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:11,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real whatchamacallits
are nothing like bananas.</font>

122
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they?</font>

123
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you never seen one?
Shh!</font>

124
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:20,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, being a virgin in this day
and age is something to be proud of.</font>

125
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a unicorn.</font>

126
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a unicorn.</font>

127
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had relations with
my high school boyfriend.</font>

128
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:31,184
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We did it to Madonna's Erotica
on the floor of his walk-in closet.</i></font>

129
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:34,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he wouldn't let me look at it.</font>

130
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He cried after and during.</font>

131
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gay now.</font>

132
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:40,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he was gay then.</font>

133
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you never seen one
when you were growing up?</font>

134
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, you know, on the Internet,
in a picture, or Harvey Keitel's?</font>

135
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've caught glimpses but I've never
got a real good look at one.</font>

136
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:54,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I need to do is practice
on the actual model.</font>

137
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the dean has it
locked in his office.</font>

138
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's easy.
We'll go to him, ask him if we...</font>

139
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:02,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. This is really embarrassing.
I don't want anyone to know.</font>

140
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna figure out how to do it
and get it over with.</font>

141
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean is counting on me,</font>

142
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I want him to know
that I'm someone he can trust.</font>

143
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to break into his office.</font>

144
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually have no problem with that.
I think I could do that.</font>

145
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello, Jeffrey.
Hi, Pierce.</font>

146
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:30,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just going into the fair
to wait for my smoking-hot date.</font>

147
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.
How about you?</font>

148
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:35,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you ever able to, you know,
come up with a date?</font>

149
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, because I didn't try,</font>

150
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">because taking a date
to an STD fair would be lame.</font>

151
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:44,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it, kid.
You're going through a dry spell.</font>

152
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">From my experience, they don't last
any more than 12, 13 years.</font>

153
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

154
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">No gonorrhea,
please, please, please.</font>

155
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">No gonorrhea.</font>

156
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! It burns.</font>

157
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! That's gonna hurt.
Gross.</font>

158
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, your assistant, is she single?
What are her likes and dislikes?</font>

159
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:09,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, on single.
She likes hip-hop and horses.</font>

160
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dislikes beards and...
Yeah, I was done talking.</font>

161
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:20,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it me or are horses
the most beautiful creatures?</font>

162
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're so majestic.
Totally.</font>

163
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:26,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just this morning, when I was shaving
and listening to the new Jay-Z,</font>

164
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:29,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking how I wanna
squeeze in a gallop this weekend.</font>

165
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you own a horse?</font>

166
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you ever really own a horse?</font>

167
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.
Yeah?</font>

168
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:40,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Sabrina.</font>

169
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty seconds
after you walked away,</font>

170
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:45,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked her to be my date
and she said yes.</font>

171
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have a great personality.
Thank you.</font>

172
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, Jeff, you proved me wrong.
You got a girl.</font>

173
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:51,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I did.
Oh.</font>

174
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Doreen.
Ready for our double-date?</font>

175
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.
Wait, how'd you do that?</font>

176
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this the best safe-sex fair
or what?</font>

177
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha!
Check out these condoms.</font>

178
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">All along the side it says,
"Greendale."</font>

179
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exclamation point, my idea.</font>

180
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:19,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Me, in a dune buggy, with syphilis.
This is going on the fridge.</font>

181
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:22,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh, heh. Look how gorgeous
Doreen is tonight.</font>

182
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, can we...?</font>

183
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's lay out our plans
for the evening.</font>

184
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wingman me, I wingman you.</font>

185
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we split up
for a little hoo-ha</font>

186
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:38,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then meet in the morning
for eggs and details.</font>

187
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like the worst
combination plate ever.</font>

188
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
Argh!</font>

189
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you beat me again.</font>

190
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want my stuffed animal?
Gah!</font>

191
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're arm wrestling.</font>

192
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,654
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like Stallone in Over the Top. I don't know the rules.
Don't I need a semi-truck and a son?</i></font>

193
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rules are, "You suck." Let's go.</font>

194
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I wanna wait for a more inspiring
song. This score isn't right.</font>

195
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

196
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

197
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke my hand, you bastard.</font>

198
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:59,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do anything with this.</font>

199
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, let me see that.</font>

200
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can see through the door.</font>

201
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:09,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, there she blows.</font>

202
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:11,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna see, I wanna see.
Shh!</font>

203
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go, go, go. Go ahead.</font>

204
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:19,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one that needs to see.
Okay, okay, okay.</font>

205
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

206
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:27,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy.</font>

207
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:32,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I had it wrong.</font>

208
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:34,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that considered large?</font>

209
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
Yes.</font>

210
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,234
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What in the reverse Porky's
is going on here?</i></font>

211
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:46,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Doreen
speaks six languages.</font>

212
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should hear her
order wine in French.</font>

213
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, honey, say,
"cabernet sauvigonenon."</font>

214
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you're embarrassing me.
You know a lot about wine?</font>

215
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:58,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I did have a client
who owned a vineyard in Napa.</font>

216
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:02,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was into S&M and merlot
so we called it S&M&M.</font>

217
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, you're boring
the crap out of Jeff.</font>

218
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:10,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.
I have to make tinkles.</font>

219
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then, I'm gonna go
get us another round.</font>

220
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:18,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you are not
what I expected.</font>

221
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're smart, you're classy,
you're not wearing go-go boots.</font>

222
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're in the shop.</font>

223
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
despite what people think,</font>

224
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:28,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually spend
most of my time talking.</font>

225
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">As men get older, they wanna
spend time with someone</font>

226

<font color="#FFFFFF">they can have a real
conversation with.</font>

227
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is going to suck.
"Going to," Jeff?</font>

228
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Sabrina's cute,</font>

229
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,626
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but she thinks that Monty Python
is the evil snake from Harry Potter.</i></font>

230
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, I know girls I can converse
with who are way more annoying.</font>

231
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take "tinkles" over
"we need to talk" every time.</font>

232
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, babe.</font>

233
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready to show me that Lexus?</font>

234
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:56,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd never ask.</font>

235
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doreen, it was very nice
to meet you.</font>

236
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do better.</font>

237
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

238
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they already left?
What a couple of nincompoops.</font>

239
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I buy dinner, I have to ask.</font>

240
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any lovemaking
on the table?</font>

241
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're through, Pierce.</font>

242
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go to the bar
and you can join me if you'd like.</font>

243
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can still have
a lovely evening,</font>

244
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it will cost you 200 bucks.</font>

245
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a pretty big discount.</font>

246
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had no idea alcohol
would make people horny.</font>

247
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes me sleepy. I don't...</font>

248
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:03,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean?
Yeah.</font>

249
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a 597 currently
going on in your office.</font>

250
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:10,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">597? There's a dog-fighting ring
in my office?</font>

251
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

252
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:16,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around
and we're gonna cover him up.</font>

253
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, ladies, I am shocked</font>

254
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,258
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>at the reverse Porky's
that has happened here.</i></font>

255
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:25,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see what the big deal is.
Annie needed to look at the model of the pen...</font>

256
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, the P-word has
entered into play.</font>

257
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly why I wanted Gayle,
our school counselor here,</font>

258
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:34,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Monique, who's keeping
record, to ensure</font>

259
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">we discuss these sensitive topics
in a legally appropriate manner.</font>

260
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think everyone should say "penis"</font>

261
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:43,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can take away the
negative power of the word, yeah?</font>

262
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">So everybody.</font>

263
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Penis.
She didn't say it.</font>

264
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:50,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now why did you break in
to see the penis?</font>

265
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, I really do feel more
comfortable saying that now, Gayle.</font>

266
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:58,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna focus on the girl
who won't say "penis."</font>

267
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a judgment-free zone,
so express yourself.</font>

268
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

269
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to express myself.</font>

270
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:26,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna sit in a room
full of people and say the P-word.</font>

271
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like being repressed.</font>

272
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am totally comfortable being
uncomfortable with my sexuality.</font>

273
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe, just maybe, if everyone
were a little more like me,</font>

274
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't have to have
an STD fair.</font>

275
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go, girl.
That's my pumpkin.</font>

276
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

277
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, now that I've gotten
a good look at one,</font>

278
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see what all the fuss
was about.</font>

279
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">A giant thumb in a turtleneck.
Whoop-dee-doo!</font>

280
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:07,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a really awesome body.
You probably hear that all the time.</font>

281
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as much as I should.</font>

282
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh. Professor.</font>

283
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

284
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:17,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a professor.</font>

285
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're at Greendale
and you're old.</font>

286
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a student.</font>

287
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:24,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yikers.</font>

288
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:28,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's pretty much
yikers for me too.</font>

289
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:33,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess I can make
an exception, professor.</font>

00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:50,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the best athlete on campus,
I need you to run to my office</font>

310
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,606

<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you let me win the race.
But you didn't say anything.</font>

314
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:08,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because
I wanted it to be true.</font>

No, Abed.</font>

For the love of God, run.</font>

322
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped.</font>

323
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, she's hot.</font>

I would have to pay.</font>
