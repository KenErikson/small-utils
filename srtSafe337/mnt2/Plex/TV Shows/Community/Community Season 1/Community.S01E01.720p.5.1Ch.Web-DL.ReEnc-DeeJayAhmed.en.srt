00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning. Uop.</font>

2
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:22,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we turn this off? Okay, can you help me?
Can you come and help me turn it off? Oh-oh.</font>

3
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:25,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we turn this off? Can you
help me with this? Can you help me with...</font>

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you, thank you so
much. I didn't mean to snap.</font>

5
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:30,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhm, good morning.</font>

6
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:36,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many of you are halfway through your first
week here at Greendale, and as your dean,</font>

7
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:41,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I would share a few thoughts
of wisdom and inspiration.</font>

8
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is community college?</font>

9
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:46,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you've heard all kinds of things.</font>

10
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:52,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've heard it's a loser college
for remedial teens, 20-something dropouts,</font>

11
00:00:52,812 --> 00:01:00,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">middle-aged divorcees, and old people keeping
their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity.</font>

12
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:05,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you heard. However, I wish you luck!</font>

13
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know... Oh-oh.</font>

14
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:14,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, there's more to this speech. There's
actually a middle card that is missing.</font>

15
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we all look around our immediate areas,
'cause I really wanted to...</font>

16
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only half-Arabic,
actually. My dad is Palestinian.</font>

17
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a US citizen. He's not a threat
to national security or anything.</font>

18
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of people want to know that after
they meet him, because he has an angry energy.</font>

19
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not like angry at America, just
angry at my mom for leaving him.</font>

20
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:30,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although she did leave because he was angry,
and he was angry because she's American.</font>

21
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Abed, by the way.</font>

22
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, nice to know you and
then meet you, in that order.</font>

23
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:38,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, about that question that I had...
- Oh, uh...</font>

24
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:40,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five after 11:00 when you asked.</font>

25
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- Yeah.</font>

26
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:44,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the deal with
the hot girl from Spanish class?</font>

27
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:46,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't find a road in there.</font>

28
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I only talked to her once, while she
was borrowing a pencil, but...</font>

29
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name is Britta, she's 28, birthday
in October, she has two older brothers,</font>

30
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one of them works with children
who have a disorder I might want to look up.</font>

31
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:55,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and she thinks she's gonna
flunk tomorrow's test,</font>

32
00:01:55,842 --> 00:01:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">so she really needs to focus, so she's sorry
if that makes her seem cold.</font>

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

34
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed...</font>

35
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see your value now.</font>

36
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.</font>

37
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely not.</font>

38
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:17,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">If these guys knew you like I did,
they would have given you a small office.</font>

39
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger! Genius at law.</font>

40
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:25,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got to stop saying that.
- I will never do that. Sit down</font>

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to
connect 'September the 11th' with my DUI,</font>

42
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a student.</font>

43
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:43,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.
- Uh, I... I am in a bit of a jam.</font>

44
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The state bar has suspended my license.</font>

45
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:50,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found out my college degree
was less than legitimate.</font>

46
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you had a
bachelor's from Columbia.</font>

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I have to get one from America.</font>

48
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it can't be an e-mail attachment.</font>

49
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you've picked a fine school.
- Yes!</font>

50
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:03,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm hoping that our friendship
will yield certain advantages.</font>

51
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know, academic guidance, moral support...
- Yes.</font>

52
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:11,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every answer to every test for every
one of the classes that I'm taking.</font>

53
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here's my schedule.
- No. Now Jeff, just by asking that,</font>

54
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:19,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have insulted the integrity
of this entire institution. Hey!</font>

55
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waster! Not a bathroom!
Not a bathroom.</font>

56
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:27,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay Duncan, you did seem less
into integrity the day that I convinced</font>

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">12 of yours peers that when you made
that 'U-turn' on the freeway</font>

58
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tried to order chalupas
from the emergency call box,</font>

59
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your only real crime
was loving America.</font>

60
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do love America.
I love it very much.</font>

61
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I love chalupas.</font>

62
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

63
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:48,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll look into it.
- Thank you. Duncan, you are a good man.</font>

64
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:52,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, are you familiar with the
adage 'cheaters never prosper'?</font>

65
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:53,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

66
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:57,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if I wanted to learn something,
I wouldn't have come to community college.</font>

- Yeah, don't hit on me, okay?</font>

69
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, I wouldn't dream of it.</font>

70
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:39,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to let you know
about my Spanish study group.</font>

71
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:44,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, woh-wow, the guy who's playing 'Bejeweled'
on his iPhone all class has a study group?</font>

72
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:46,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhm, can I sign up twice?</font>

73
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:50,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking the class as an easy credit.
I'm actually a Spanish tutor.</font>

74
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:53,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Board certified.
- Can you say that in Spanish now?</font>

75
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duermo tarde español, una hora más, no
rallar mi coche.</font>

76
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:04,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I really need help with Spanish.
- Yeah, I was willing to bet. I'm Jeff.</font>

77
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:06,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or 'Jefe'.</font>

78

- Britta. Thanks.</font>

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna be there?</font>

80
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poquito más.</font>

81
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:17,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means "See you there".</font>

82
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't be too hard to fake
a study group, right?</font>

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh jeez, I'm sorry, uh...</font>

conditioned to believe that every</font>

stuff there. That's it.</font>

97
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of the group is running late.</font>

98
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you and I can get acquainted.</font>

99
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have noticed this morning,
not so good at the small talk.</font>

100
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:09,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I like big talk. What's your deal?</font>

101
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:12,749

- What's your deal and is God dead?</font>

102
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:14,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you wanna know my deal?</font>

103
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dropped out of high school because I thought
for some reason it would impress Radiohead.</font>

104
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be surprised what
gets back to these guys.</font>

105
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:24,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I joined the Peace Corp.</font>

106

gassed in a World Trade Rally...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Marry me.</font>

108
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I guess Jeff, my deal
is above all else... honesty.</font>

109
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:35,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Honesty?
- Yeah.</font>

110
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:39,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me the truth, I will like you.
You lie to me, I will never talk to you again.</font>

111
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my deal.</font>

112
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, that's a good deal.
- So, what's your deal?</font>

113
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:48,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I would have to go...
I would have to say, uhm, honesty.</font>

114
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:49,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because...</font>

115
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:55,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would say anything to get what
I want, and I want you to like me, so...</font>

116
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. That's a very honest answer.</font>

117
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, for now I like you, fine.</font>

118
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really? Wow, you're easy.
- Hell yeah.</font>

119
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:09,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed in the house! Woah!
- Woah!</font>

120
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Woah! Why?
- Oh, Britta invited me. Is that cool?</font>

121
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:15,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can't think of a single
logical reason why not.</font>

122
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cool.
- There you go.</font>

123
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, here. Put your contact
info down right there.</font>

124
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:22,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's great.
- Cool, cool, cool.</font>

125
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, cool, cool.</font>

126
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast Club, huh?</font>

127
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are in a library.
- Yeah.</font>

128
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:31,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us
that would make us cry if we talked about it.</font>

129
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:34,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have something
balled up inside you?</font>

130
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I got a little doozy
in the chamber if things get emotional.</font>

131
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hey, text message.</font>

132
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's give this bad boy a read.
- That's probably just for you.</font>

133
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've never gotten one of these.
- Well, uh.. it's probably... you just...</font>

134
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just for your eyes.
- "Say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."</font>

135
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Say you have to pee."
- That is weird.</font>

136
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."
- Yeah. Do you have to pee?</font>

137
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:01,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. That's so weird.
- Mm. Well, I'm stumped. That's very creepy.</font>

138
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:02,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes two of us.</font>

139
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- Does it say you have to pee?</font>

140
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:08,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's just someone with a
misguided grasp of abbreviation.</font>

141
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:14,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just need five minutes, you guys.
So go ahead and study all the verbs. In Spanish.</font>

142
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:16,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed...
- Yeah?</font>

143
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:17,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your read on that guy?</font>

144
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:20,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like Elisabeth Shue.</font>

145
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:26,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just act natural... pretend you are watching
the athletic proceedings.</font>

146
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't stop me from watching them.</font>

147
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a guy trying out for the track,
that's older than the game of poker.</font>

148
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's kinda trucking.</font>

149
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:39,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose I was to say to you it was
possible to get those test answers.</font>

150
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would say go for that. And could
have said so in a text.</font>

151
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:45,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking you, if you know the
difference between right and wrong.</font>

152
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:49,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I discovered at a very early age
that if I talked long enough,</font>

153
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could make anything right or wrong.</font>

154
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:56,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">So either I'm god or truth
is relative. And in either case, booyah.</font>

155
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, interesting.</font>

156
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the average person has a much
harder time saying booyah to moral relativism.</font>

157
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:04,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duncan, you don't have to play
shrink to protect your pride.</font>

158
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accept. You're chicken.</font>

159
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to use reverse
psychology on a psychologist?</font>

160
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm just using regular psychology
on a spineless, British twit.</font>

161
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a professor. You can't
talk to me that way.</font>

162
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.
- Yes, because that would be adorable!</font>

163
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:20,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because you're a five-year-old girl,
and there's a pecking order.</font>

164
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine, I'll do it!
- Thank you.</font>

165
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:25,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, pleasure. Bye!</font>

166
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! good!</font>

167
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I still shouting?</font>

168
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm drawing attention to myself.</font>

169
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:33,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys aren't going to believe this,
but the rest of the group...</font>

170
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is here.</font>

171
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you the board-certified tutor?</font>

172
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means you do my
homework, right Seacrest?</font>

173
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to call my babysitter
if we gonna be later than 10:00.</font>

174
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What board certifies a tutor?</font>

175
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:46,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's Britta?
- Not sure.</font>

176
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:48,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I invited more people
from Spanish class. Is that cool?</font>

177
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:51,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the coolest.</font>

178
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go to the bathroom...</font>

179
00:09:54,383 --> 00:10:01,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">And bring my jacket, wallet and keys
with me. In case there's a fire.</font>

180
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:03,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we go with him?</font>

181
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving my homework with
Slumdog Millionaire over here.</font>

182
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's borderline racist I think.</font>

183
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... busted.</font>

184
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, listen.
- Now you know. I'm a smoker.</font>

185
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but they're filtered,
so that makes them safe.</font>

186
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready to get started? Looks like
the rest of your group showed up.</font>

187
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:26,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, not mine actually.
I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist.</font>

188
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:30,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was trained never to say this,
but I think that group may be untutorable.</font>

189
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:31,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

190
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:34,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, why don't you and
I go study over some...</font>

191
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dinner?
- Or drinks.</font>

192
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, actually, we should prioritize here
and study first, and then go to dinner.</font>

193
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:46,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they really prove
to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.</font>

194
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:52,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. They will be... untutorable.</font>

195
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

196
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this crew.</font>

197
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:06,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">All ready to study all night.</font>

198
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can stay at least till 10:00.</font>

199
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who studies with strangers, right?</font>

200
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:11,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Jeff.</font>

201
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, it's a pleasure.</font>

202
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Pierce Hawthorne, and yes...</font>

203
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes,
the award-winning moist towellete.</font>

204
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just gonna ask.</font>

205
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Toastmaster, so perhaps
I should do the introductions.</font>

206
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Definitely!
- All right, you already know Brittles.</font>

207
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:27,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta.
- Uh, Abed. Abed the Arab.</font>

208
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that inappropriate?
- Sure.</font>

209
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Roy. Roy the Wonder Boy.
- Troy.</font>

210
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Little Princess Elizabeth.
- Annie.</font>

211
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:36,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">And finally, this beautiful
creature is named Shirley.</font>

212
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:38,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that even close?</font>

213
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to know why I had to find
out about this group on accident.</font>

214
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:43,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is getting way more like 'Breakfast Club' now.
- Where's breakfast.</font>

215
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, uhm, maybe we should get started.
- You know, I've been a part of a lot study groups</font>

216
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">that fell apart because of unresolved tension.</font>

217
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?
Did we not invite her?</font>

218
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Annie, sweetie, it's not
behind your back.</font>

219
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:57,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just didn't think about...
- Can we stop with the 'pumpkins' and the 'sweeties'?</font>

220
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being younger does not make me inferior.</font>

221
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:04,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, your age indicates
that you've made bad life decisions.</font>

222
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shirley has a response to that.
- No, no, no, I don't.</font>

223
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please Shirley, go ahead.
- Okay, okay.</font>

224
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:16,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions,
and maybe Annie's decisions will be better.</font>

225
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think she needs to decide
whether she wants to be considered a child,</font>

226
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">or an adult, because children get pity,
but not respect. And adults, they get respect,</font>

227
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they also get the back of they head grabbed
and their face pushed through jukeboxes.</font>

228
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:32,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay! Why don't we try learning
'jukebox' in Spanish?</font>

229
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Pierce!</font>

230
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's discuss this creepiness.
- Pardon you?</font>

231
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- I'm certified.</font>

232
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you unaware that Shirley
finds your advances inappropriate?</font>

233
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:45,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">What advances?</font>

234
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been sexually harassing me
since the very first day of class.</font>

235
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sexually harassing?</font>

236
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:56,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? That makes no sense to me.
Why would I harass somebody who turns me on?</font>

237
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:59,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saying she turns you on
is the harassment, dude.</font>

238
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

239
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:05,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a prominent business leader,
and a highly sought-after dinner guest...</font>

240
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:09,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will not take courting advice
from some teenage... boy.</font>

241
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:13,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this teenage boy
is a quarterback and a prom king.</font>

242
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not prom king anymore, Troy.
This isn't Riverside High.</font>

243
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you know I went there?</font>

244
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're still wearing
your stupid letter jacket.</font>

245
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:25,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And more importantly, I sat
behind you in Algebra.</font>

246
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:29,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, you're that girl that got
hooked on pills and then dropped out.</font>

247
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:30,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're little Annie 'Adderall'.</font>

248
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:36,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship
by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.</font>

249
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:39,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off.
- Don't talk to me.</font>

250
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:41,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know... I'm a legend.</font>

251
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I got for Christmas?</font>

252
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a banner year at the Bender family.</font>

253
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a carton of cigarettes.</font>

254
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old man grabbed me, he said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny!"</font>

255
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">"No, dad! What about you?"</font>

256
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:11,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh... that actually was from
'The Breakfast Club'.</font>

257
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody puts baby in the corner.</font>

258
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:16,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dirty dancing.</font>

259
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:18,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- It's professor Duncan.</font>

260
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>Come to the parking lot now.</i>
- What's wrong with your voice?</font>

261
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,237
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm disguising it.</i></font>

262
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:27,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'll be right back.</font>

263
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:30,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">But while I'm gone, you guys need
to hash this stuff out.</font>

264
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stone unturned.</font>

265
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

266
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in the car!</font>

267
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Act as if either you have just finished
or yet to begin driving.</font>

268
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:56,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every answer to every test
in your curriculum this semester.</font>

269
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:58,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.</font>

270
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa there, grabby-grabby.</font>

271
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do I get?
- The satisfaction of being even.</font>

272
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:07,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even, fairness, right, wrong.
There is no God.</font>

273
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Booyah, booyah.
- What do you want from me?</font>

274
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Lexus.
- My car for a semester's worth of answers?</font>

275
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:15,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will it be just a semester though, Jeff?</font>

276
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't you be taking the easy way out
for the next four years?</font>

277
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:23,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want payment in advance. I want
leather seats with built-in ball warmers.</font>

278
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:27,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, bluffs this weak are how
your people lost the colonies.</font>

279
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice disbarment hearing.</font>

280
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What am I supposed to drive?
- Well, you should take this car. It's good for the earth.</font>

281
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf,
but it's not how a man gets around!</font>

282
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:44,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">A golf cart.</font>

283
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:54,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is a disaster in there.
- Yeah, untutorable.</font>

284
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:58,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You like Thai food? I love Thai food.
- Wait... so, this is a game to you?</font>

285
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:03,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put human beings into a state of emotional
shambles, for a shot at getting in my pants?</font>

286
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:07,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you see that
for the compliment that it is?</font>

287
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, ok, ok, I'm sorry. It was an accident.</font>

288
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did a little bit of lying
to get close to you.</font>

289
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how was I suppose to know
that you were smart and cool.</font>

290
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you look like Elizabeth Shue.</font>

291
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're unbelievable.
- What do you want me to do?</font>

292
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, maybe one decent thing could be
to go in there and clean up your mess.</font>

293
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,325
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay, I am the Barack Obama of this room.</i></font>

294
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if I do that... then dinner, right?</font>

295
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, fine, whatever.</font>

296
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:38,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if there's a dinner on earth that could
make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.</font>

297
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:41,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're gonna eat those words
when you see my new car.</font>

298
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody!</font>

299
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to say something.
Sit down.</font>

300
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:57,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to yell. I don't
appreciate your tone.</font>

301
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what makes humans
different from other animals?</font>

302
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:03,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feet.</font>

303
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, come on, bears have feet.</font>

304
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:10,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the only species on earth
that observes 'Shark Week'.</font>

305
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharks don't even observe
'Shark Week', but we do.</font>

306
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:18,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the same reason I can pick up this pencil,
tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this.</font>

307
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:26,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">And part of you dies just a little bit on the
inside, because people can connect with anything.</font>

308
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can sympathize with a pencil.</font>

309
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:32,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can forgive a shark, and we can give
Ben Affleck an academy award for screenwriting.</font>

310
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Big mistake.
- He's got a point.</font>

311
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:38,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can find the good in just
about anything but themselves.</font>

312
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:41,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me. It's clear to
all of you that I am awesome,</font>

313
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can never admit that,
because that would make me an ass.</font>

314
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:48,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what I can do is see
what makes Annie awesome. She's driven.</font>

315
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:52,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need driven people or the
lights go out and the ice cream melts.</font>

316
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:54,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Pierce.
We need guys like Pierce.</font>

317
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy has wisdom to offer.</font>

318
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Dalai Lama and I...
- We should listen to him sometime.</font>

319
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wouldn't regret it.
And Shirley.</font>

320
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:07,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley has earned our respect. Not
as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman.</font>

321
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't test her on that,
because that thing about the jukebox</font>

322
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">was way too specific to be improvised.
And Troy.</font>

323
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:17,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that?
Maybe he is.</font>

324
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think astronauts go to the moon
because they hate oxygen? No!</font>

325
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to impress
their high school prom king.</font>

326
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:27,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Abed.
Abed's a shaman.</font>

327
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask him to pass the salt,
he gives you a bowl of soup.</font>

328
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:33,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you know what? Soup is better.</font>

329
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed is better.</font>

330
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are all better
than you think you are.</font>

331
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:40,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are just designed not to believe it
when you hear it from yourself.</font>

332
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soup?</font>

333
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to look
to the person to your left.</font>

334
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Look at the person
sitting next to you.</font>

335
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at her? Okay.</font>

336
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This...?
- Yeah.</font>

337
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to extend to that person...</font>

338
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">the same compassion that you extend
to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck.</font>

339
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:02,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to say
to that person, "I forgive you."</font>

340
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I forgive you.
- I forgive you.</font>

341
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I forgive you.
- You little twerp.</font>

342
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I'd like you to say,
"I forgive you."</font>

343
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:10,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say it?</font>

344
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgive you.</font>

345
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've just stopped being a study group.</font>

346
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've become something... unstoppable.</font>

347
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hereby pronounce you... a community.</font>

348
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice. I like that.</font>

349
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:30,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore.</font>

350
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs.
Anything with Bill Murray, really.</font>

351
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:36,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree with Abed that tonight
has been very special.</font>

352
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:40,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a dinner engagement with Britta.</font>

353
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta?
- I lied.</font>

354
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:49,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for calming everyone down, but since
you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep</font>

355
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">who purposely upset everyone
in an attempt to get with me,</font>

356
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:56,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd appreciate it if you left
and stopped wasting all of our time.</font>

357
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody ready?</font>

358
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

359
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm happy to report...</font>

360
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">that one of the benefits
of being a lying creep,</font>

361
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">is having all the answers
to tomorrow's test.</font>

362
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:14,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm happy to share them with anyone
whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.</font>

363
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, if you have all the answers,
why the hell did you start this study group?</font>

364
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a study group,
Pierce. I made it up.</font>

365
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:24,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about the 'Look Left' speech?
- Made it up. That's what I do.</font>

366
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:30,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make things up. And I got paid a lot of money
to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet.</font>

367
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a lawyer.</font>

368
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I thought you were
like Bill Murray in any of his films,</font>

369
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:38,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're more like
Michael Douglas in any of his films.</font>

370
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

371
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have Asperger's.</font>

372
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:44,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

373
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Ass-burger'.</font>

374
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a serious disorder.
- It really is.</font>

375
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:51,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's so serious,
why don't they call it meningitis?</font>

376
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ass-burger.
- Burger for your ass.</font>

377
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may
want to think about the gift you've been given.</font>

378
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An excuse to punch a hippy?
- No. No, not that.</font>

379
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">An important lesson, my friend.</font>

380
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:32,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, the tools you acquired to survive
out there will not help you here at Greendale.</font>

381
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:35,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you have my friend,
is a second chance at an honest life.</font>

382
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are people trying to teach me things
at a school that has an express tuition aisle?</font>

383
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me the keys.
- No, I have to keep your car for the lesson...</font>

384
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me.</font>

385
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, Jeffrey!</font>

386
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we cool?</font>

387
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:51,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we cool?</font>

388
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're cool.</font>

389
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you, Jeffrey.</font>

390
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me of myself at your age.</font>

391
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserve that.</font>

392
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:10,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've been divorced...
seven times.</font>

393
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, I think I'm doing
something wrong.</font>

394
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep getting married.</font>

395
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never looked at it that way.</font>

396
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you guys be studying?</font>

397
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, things got kind
of boring after you left.</font>

398
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:34,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you something.</font>

399
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have been clowning me for wearing
this jacket ever since I got here, but...</font>

400
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I take it off to make them happy,
that just makes me weak, right?</font>

401
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, it doesn't matter.</font>

402
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lose the jacket to please them,
you keep it to piss them off.</font>

403
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way it's for them.</font>

404
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:53,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what's weak.</font>

405
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just wrinkled my brain, man.</font>

406
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's good, isn't he?
- He's real good.</font>

407
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be rolling around
on a bed covered in test answers?</font>

408
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:10,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have any of the answers.</font>

409
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna...
I'm gonna flunk the test.</font>

410
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:14,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you just, like, study for like
an hour, It's not that hard.</font>

411
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem pretty
smart. You got a sports coat.</font>

412
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, me...</font>

413
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:19,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny thing about being smart,</font>

414
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:23,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that you can get through most of life
without ever having to do any work.</font>

415
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh...</font>

416
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:27,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not really sure how to do that.</font>

417
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:42,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?
Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf?</font>

418
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you hear me talking right now? Yes?
- Yes.</font>

419
