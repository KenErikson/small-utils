1
00:00:01,256 --> 00:00:03,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to get up so early for my bus</font>

2
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:05,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I caught what Cinemax
gets up to at night.</font>

3
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subscription cancelled.</font>

4
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:09,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got that channel for Eddie
Murphy movies, not stimulation.</font>

5
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you taking the bus?
What happened to your minivan?</font>

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">My ex-husband needed it.
The person he's dating works at a club</font>

7
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:17,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">an hour from the city.</font>

8
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:20,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, I'll play a violin for
them and maybe she can strip to it.</font>

9
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:23,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind people are always kind, Britta.
Not just when it's easy.</font>

10
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:25,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">As we stand, once again</font>

11
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">upon the deadline
to drop or add classes,</font>

12
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:32,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hereby present this semester's
Jeff Winger pick</font>

13
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:36,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">for ultimate blow-off class:
Beginner Pottery.</font>

14
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your last "blow off" class ended up
teaching me to live in the moment.</font>

15
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I will always regret
and never do again.</font>

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's different.
I researched.</font>

17
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:45,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to make
a good pot.</font>

18
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:49,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get an art credit
for participation.</font>

19
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,139
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This class is like a redhead that drinks
Scotch and loves Die Hard.</i></font>

20
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:55,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you all get her number.</font>

21
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahoy.</font>

22
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess which class I signed up for.</font>

23
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Singing with Tennille?</font>

24
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:03,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sailing.</font>

25
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:06,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nearest body of water
is two and a half hours away.</font>

26
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:07,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leagues, Abed.</font>

27
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:09,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't measure water
by hours.</font>

28
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:13,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a one-week intensive that gives
you hands-on experience on a real boat</font>

29
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">right here in the parking lot.</font>

30
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather learn boats
than pots.</font>

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna take a class on how to put
together an online dating profile.</font>

32
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think sailing in the
parking lot is less pathetic.</font>

33
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">A black person on a sail boat?
I gotta see this. I'm in.</font>

34
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you, Abed?
You wanna sail with us?</font>

35
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's black people.
Mm-hm. Two.</font>

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

37
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, ladies.
What you guys making, big balls here?</font>

38
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
You guys getting dirty? Nice.</font>

39
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at?
Heh, heh. All right.</font>

40
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:49,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Laura Ingalls.
Home Depot guy.</font>

41
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's making pots, huh?</font>

42
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do wanna make
my mom an ashtray.</font>

43
00:01:58,774 --> 00:01:59,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

44
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:07,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, my precious blueberries.</font>

45
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.
Hi.</font>

46
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's spin those
wheels and play with some clay.</font>

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, there's one and only
one rule in this class.</font>

48
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:21,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will tolerate no reenacting,
whether it's ironic or sincere,</font>

49
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:25,292
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>of the Patrick Swayze-Demi Moore
pottery scene in Ghost.</i></font>

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since that movie
was released in 1990,</font>

51
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:34,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen every conceivable
variation of what I call ghosting.</font>

52
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can be guy-on-girl,
girl-on-guy.</font>

53
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:40,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hilarious guy-on-guy.</font>

54
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">So since it never stopped,</font>

55
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:53,219
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I had to adopt
a zero-Ghost- tolerance policy.</i></font>

56
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you so much as hum three notes
from that Righteous Brothers song</font>

57
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:58,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">with God as my witness,
I will come at you</font>

58
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:01,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">with everything I've got, okay?</font>

59
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a great time.</font>

60
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm making falafel.</font>

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
Not edible.</font>

62
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:15,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you making?</font>

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">A vase.</font>

64
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.
Yep?</font>

65
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what I made.</font>

66
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:23,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">A participant badge.</font>

67
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how.</font>

68
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:32,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I just stuck my hands
into the clay and it happened.</font>

69
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look at me.</font>

70
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a gift.</font>

71
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:39,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's competitive
side had come out before,</font>

72
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had even displayed envy,
but on that first day of Pottery class...</font>

73
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Yeah?</font>

74
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:47,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did we discuss?
No voiceover. I'm sorry.</font>

75
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is kind of a crutch.</font>

76
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been
on a boat before.</font>

77
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:00,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what to wear.</font>

78
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's intimidating.</font>

79
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in Pierce's world now.</font>

80
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got all the boat clothes,
and look at him christen.</font>

81
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that were me,
I would have broken the bottle.</font>

82
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:13,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Professor Slaughter.</font>

83
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,467
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Welcome aboard
the S.S. Nose Candy,</i></font>

84
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">purchased through
government auction.</font>

85
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.</font>

86
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not nice. It's your only
weapon against the raging sea.</font>

87
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't know how to use her,
you're dead.</font>

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together, you will work as one crew.
You will succeed or fail as one crew.</font>

89
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will consider this parking lot
the ocean.</font>

90
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you drop, you lose.</font>

91
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:35,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mishandle the sails,
you capsize and die.</font>

92
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, does Little Miss Nice
have a name?</font>

93
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley Bennett.</font>

94
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:42,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you're
Captain Shirley Bennett.</font>

95
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man.
You will follow her every order.</font>

96
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

97
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:51,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been a captain before.
I have.</font>

98
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I commanded a jet ski
through an electrical storm</font>

99
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and only had one casualty.</font>

100
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jet skis only hold two people.</font>

101
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. Saved half the crew.</font>

102
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pottery is much cooler than I thought.
And harder.</font>

103
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, except for that guy Rich.
He's like a natural.</font>

104
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:09,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm worried about the effect
that it's having on Jeff, though.</font>

105
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:12,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, someone call a shrink.
What?</font>

106
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're usually
the cool one.</font>

107
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you understand the point
of a blow-off class is to blow it off?</font>

108
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:21,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to be cool at making
really important mud pies.</font>

109
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:25,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not willing to admit he's talented?
No, because he's not.</font>

110
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:29,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I ever make an effort in that class,
you'd think I was the cat's pajamas.</font>

111
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:30,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Cat's pajamas"?</font>

112
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Pierce.</font>

113
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:36,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Somebody's mommy
gave him too much praise.</font>

114
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:38,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, so did someone's
psych teacher.</font>

115
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Señor Chang.</font>

116
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:50,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I was robbed
at the YMCA: Again.</font>

117
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:59,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's do this.</font>

118
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:12,391
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff, do you know what you are?</i></font>

119
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:13,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're special.</font>

120
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:15,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very special, Jeff.</font>

121
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the most special
little boy in the world.</font>

122
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take her back to harbor.</font>

123
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flank the sheets
and trim the headsail.</font>

124
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eyes on me for a moment.</font>

125
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:44,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see students here,
I see seamen.</font>

126
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I didn't create them.</font>

127
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the moment you climbed
aboard, I saw seamen inside you.</font>

128
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:53,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">More importantly, you've stopped
giggling at the word "seamen."</font>

129
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's the mark
of a real seaman.</font>

130
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, as you were.</font>

131
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then.
Crew, make fast the topping lift.</font>

132
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:02,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the rope.</font>

133
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
Damn. He's ghost riding the jib.</font>

134
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, hang on.</font>

135
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hat's gone. Lost at sea.</font>

136
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to reach it.
It landed on that Hyundai.</font>

137
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:19,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, mermaid's car.</font>

138
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back on this boat.</font>

139
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

140
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I spoke too soon.
Everybody gets a D.</font>

141
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:29,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had chosen to hit you
with a storm just then,</font>

142
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">you all would have failed.</font>

143
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better get your crew in line,
captain.</font>

144
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Permission to speak?
Mm-hm.</font>

145
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:40,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really screwed the pooch
on that one, captain.</font>

146
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't swim.</font>

147
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:46,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you see, ladies, it's
actually a working fountain</font>

148
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:47,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a bird.</font>

149
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, Jeff,</font>

150
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">ready to make some art
in the shape of a vase?</font>

151
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, can't.</font>

152
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:57,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, ouch.
Let me take a look.</font>

153
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich, being good at Beginner Pottery
doesn't mean you can heal people.</font>

154
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:04,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true.
But my medical degree does.</font>

155
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a doctor.
A doctor?</font>

156
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just take pottery to unwind.</font>

157
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:11,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't lost a patient in five years.
Puts a lot of pressure on a person.</font>

158
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the good news is this is
neither sprained nor broken.</font>

159
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:17,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.
But I'll have to get a second opinion</font>

160
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a guy in my
basket-weaving class.</font>

161
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great. It's funny.</font>

162
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you getting along with Rich.
What's he like?</font>

163
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a ringer.
A what?</font>

164
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a con man,
a grifter, a ringer.</font>

165
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:37,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an expert potter who signs up for
novice classes to impress people.</font>

166
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wants to impress,
why join a pottery class?</font>

167
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not just say,
"Hi, I'm a doctor"?</font>

168
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's crazy.</font>

169
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">And fancy jobs
don't impress people.</font>

170
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't impressed
I'm a lawyer.</font>

171
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can be a lawyer.
You can even represent yourself.</font>

172
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:53,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do surgery on yourself.
It's illegal. You'd get arrested.</font>

173
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you'd get a free lawyer.</font>

174
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich showed me how to make
a flared lip on my pot</font>

175
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">and check for breast lumps.
Ha.</font>

176
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how,
and I don't know when,</font>

177
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">but one day that guy
is gonna slip up</font>

178
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when that happens, I am
gonna be there to expose him.</font>

179
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, check it out.
If your finger's still bugging you,</font>

180
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">just get creative.</font>

181
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna kiss you on the mouth.
I'm sorry?</font>

182
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Rich. Hey.</font>

183
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't run so fast,
you're among friends.</font>

184
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,602
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How you doing, Jeff? What's up?
Not much, nada mucho.</i></font>

185
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noddily Merchant.</font>

186
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:33,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just want to thank you,
Doc Potterywood,</font>

187
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">for taking a look at my finger.</font>

188
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:39,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anytime.
Doc Potterywood, I like it.</font>

189
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you taken
many pottery classes?</font>

190
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is my first.</font>

191
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:44,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of the year?
Ever.</font>

192
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">No pottery at doctor school?
Medical school?</font>

193
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:47,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pottery school.
Pottery school?</font>

194
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, pottery school?
How long?</font>

195
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, it's kind of weird,
I feel I'm being interrogated,</font>

196
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">but by someone who doesn't really
wanna know anything important.</font>

197
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, New Mexico.
Long way from home.</font>

198
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Well, I did my residency
in Santa Fe.</font>

199
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:05,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Santa Fe.
Yeah.</font>

200
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I give you a lift somewhere?
Oh, no, thanks.</font>

201
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:10,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting there.</font>

202
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you sleep here?
Only for a few hours.</font>

203
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:25,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess where Rich is from.
Couldn't have been Crazy Town.</font>

204
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:29,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have gone to school together.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.</font>

205
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody gets out of Santa Fe
without learning to make a pot.</font>

206
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:36,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forty-five percent Hispanic.
Fifth-highest Native American population.</font>

207
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">They eat and breathe clay there.</font>

208
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think some of this research may
have been done on Wikipedia.</font>

209
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mocking me? You?</font>

210
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you, fine, go ahead, mock me.</font>

211
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff, you're Goldblum-ing.
Goldblum-ing?</font>

212
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:53,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. What? I, uh...
I don't even know what that means.</font>

213
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I have work to do
before class</font>

214
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I wanna catch Rich
when he slips up.</font>

215
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who even cares if he's
pretending to be a beginner?</font>

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pottery cares. Integrity cares.</font>

217
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:07,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't care.
I just care that he cares.</font>

218
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's lame that he cares.</font>

219
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoelace came untied.
Could happen to anybody.</font>

220
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your excuse?
Britta weighs 5 pounds.</font>

221
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy can't swim.
I've never seen the ocean.</font>

222
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:18,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I can swim, racist.</font>

223
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.
On my boat, the crew comes first.</font>

224
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:25,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">No single person is above it.
You either shape up or ship the hell out.</font>

225
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:28,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I know what the C
in captain stands for.</font>

226
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crab apple.</font>

227
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I thought you said
that kind people were always kind.</font>

228
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And strong people change.</font>

229
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the sea was always still and calm,
nobody would respect her.</font>

230
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like the sea.
Hey.</font>

231
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:43,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cuckoo birds, do you mind?
This is important.</font>

232
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">College is where most
mental problems activate.</font>

233
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I get
multiple personalities.</font>

234
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get lonely in long showers.</font>

235
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:55,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">The barometer's dropping.
The temperature is warm,</font>

236
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:59,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're heading
into a high-pressure flow.</font>

237
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a perfect storm.</font>

238
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reef the mainsail and furl the jib.</font>

239
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that nautical talk
or urban speak?</font>

240
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to turn back.
Accidental jibe.</font>

241
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit the deck.</font>

242
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:15,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Man overboard.</font>

243
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:16,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, Pierce is dead!</font>

244
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait.
His stomach is moving.</font>

245
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Pierce.</font>

246
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Pull me in.</font>

247
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The storm is overtaking you,
captain.</font>

248
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:27,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have time.</font>

249
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying as hard as I can.
I have skinny arms for a quarterback.</font>

250
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, we don't have time.</font>

251
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No. Pull...</font>

252
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Pull me in.</font>

253
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:41,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, "time"?
That's it.</font>

254
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:49,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

255
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:51,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

256
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:52,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the boom amidship.</font>

257
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

258
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:57,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

259
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in God's name have we done?</font>

260
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

261
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my parking spot,
dipwad.</font>

262
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:08,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security.</font>

263
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:12,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, take an intermediate
class if you're an intermediate.</font>

264
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:16,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't come in here making
your fear of failure our problem.</font>

265
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's crazy.
It's crazy.</font>

266
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:21,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he's a crazy person.</font>

267
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared.</font>

268
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. This is good for him.
He's confronting his own limitations.</font>

269
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Busted.</font>

270
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fatal mistake, Richy boy.</font>

271
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are busted.
I am?</font>

272
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just used the "throwing
off the hump" method.</font>

273
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an advanced pottery
technique, which I know</font>

274
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:47,097
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>because last night I read the
entire Encyclopedia of Pottery.</i></font>

275
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

276
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no beginner, Santa Fe.</font>

277
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:56,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what is going on,
my blueberries?</font>

278
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:59,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him what you did.
No.</font>

279
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:01,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rest my case.
What case?</font>

280
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw the freaking hump,
imposter.</font>

281
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? No.
Hey! Hey!</font>

282
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the hilarious
guy-on-guy.</font>

283
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:13,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">One rule I asked you to follow.
One.</font>

284
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:14,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.
Oh!</font>

285
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had it made before he died.
It's not in bad taste.</font>

286
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out, Winger.</font>

287
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. That's fine.</font>

288
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's fine.</font>

289
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:27,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.
You've failed a class so easy</font>

290
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">that people passing in the
hallway get a contact credit.</font>

291
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:47,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is abuse!
This is abuse!</font>

292
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:53,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce. Do you still have the number
of that private investigator you used</font>

293
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you thought Ross Perot
was sleeping with your mom?</font>

294
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this about that guy in your class?
Yeah.</font>

295
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Face the facts. This kid's got some
natural talent you just don't have.</font>

296
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you know?
It's all over the school.</font>

297
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:06,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

298
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you in sailing class?
They drowned me.</font>

299
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
For a better grade.</font>

300
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But weren't we discussing
your flaws, Jeff?</font>

301
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you letting this guy get to you?
What's really going on?</font>

302
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a bad pot.</font>

303
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some reason, I always thought
that I was special and different.</font>

304
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I guess I just have
a really hard time</font>

305
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:34,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I want to be good
at something and I suck.</font>

306
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

307
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, give me a hand.</font>

308
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
I'm going back to my sailing class.</font>

309
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:45,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">After they murdered you?</font>

310
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, when I was born,</font>

311
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my umbilical cord
wrapped around my neck,</font>

312
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">both arms and one of my ankles.</font>

313
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:54,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom said there came a point when
the doctors stopped delivering me</font>

314
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just started laughing. Heh.</font>

315
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:00,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if I ever let being bad
at something stop me,</font>

316
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't even be here.</font>

317
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:06,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thing some men call failure?
I call living.</font>

318
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Breakfast.</font>

319
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not leaving
till I've cleaned out the buffet.</font>

320
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how about a shove?</font>

321
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, Pierce.
Don't need it.</font>

322
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never had it.</font>

323
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:30,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, trim the boom flat.</font>

324
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, sit windward
to heel the boat.</font>

325
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">My, the sea has a worthy opponent.</font>

326
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:40,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, it's Pierce.</font>

327
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:47,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, that guy's life
is one big joke.</font>

328
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I feel bad for him,</font>

329
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">but things have been running
smoother since he drowned.</font>

330
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet he gets that
all the time.</font>

331
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh. Hey. Hey.
Oh, my God.</font>

332
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going down.
Pierce is going to be the only person</font>

333
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:11,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever to drown in a parking lot,
twice.</font>

334
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!
Damn the storm.</font>

335
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going after Pierce.</font>

336
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:21,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jump the halyard. Star-Burns, get
down there and man the iron jinny.</font>

337
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a man overboard.
That's an order.</font>

338
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna sink.</font>

339
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm about to get the only A
I will ever get,</font>

340
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:31,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Pierce isn't even dying.
Bailing.</font>

341
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:32,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.</font>

342
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:33,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

343
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:37,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd rather be kind and get
stepped on every once in a while</font>

344
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">than be a hard-ass
and turn my back on a friend.</font>

345
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoist the mains.</font>

346
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to go this way.</font>

347
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:54,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're coming, Pierce.</font>

348
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:55,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help.</font>

349
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:58,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it looking?
We've gotta go faster.</font>

350
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on, Star-Burns.</font>

351
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's filling with water.</font>

352
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:13,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going down.</font>

353
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, we're coming.</font>

354
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God. Dear God.</font>

355
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. Oh, Britta.</font>

356
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:27,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy.</font>

357
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go. We gotcha.</font>

358
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.
Okay.</font>

359
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?
You all right?</font>

360
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just steered your boat into a storm.
Any last words?</font>

361
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sea may be cold and
unforgiving, but I'm not.</font>

362
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:51,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ship might go down but at
least she'll go down with honor.</font>

363
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:53,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'll take
your captain's hat</font>

364
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm promoting
you to admiral.</font>

365
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:56,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all get an A.
Oh.</font>

366
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:58,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Admiral Shirley. I like that.</font>

367
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:01,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it means nothing, really, the class is over.
But you deserve it.</font>

368
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, somebody has to do this.</font>

369
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm king of the...</font>

370
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:09,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ruin a perfect week.</font>

371
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:16,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna spoon you again.
I appreciate that.</font>

372
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I can't fully explain
my behavior.</font>

373
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to blame booze
or demon possession...</font>

374
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? Don't worry about it.
I'm bad at holding grudges.</font>

375
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm bad at pottery.</font>

376
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:29,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an amateur pottery enthusiast</font>

377
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:33,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying as hard as I can at
something I suck at. It's great.</font>

378
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:38,096
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And the teacher said I could stay if I
don't have any more Ghost bursts.</i></font>

379
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:40,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantastic. Well, good luck.</font>

380
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't need it.</font>

381
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,841
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff, you're a normal person.</i></font>

382
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:50,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing very special
about you at all.</font>

383
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be great
at a few things</font>

384
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">but really crappy at many more.</font>

385
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that takes a lot
of the pressure off</font>

386
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can live
a full, happy life.</font>

387
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,757
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, and sorry it took me so long
to tell you that</i></font>

388
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:07,023
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and it was only
in your imagination.</i></font>

389
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:09,929
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My bad. Kind of a sloppy mom.</i></font>

390
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:13,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay, Mom.
Nobody's perfect.</font>

391
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still scared.</font>

392
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,904
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A clay ashtray. You're an idiot.</i></font>

393
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:22,171
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why do you have time
to make pottery?</i></font>

394
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:26,078
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Couldn't you use a little more
practice being a doctor?</i></font>

395
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:29,254
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Not that it'll ever bring your brother
back to life.</i></font>

396
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:33,118
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was supposed to be you
on that roller coaster, Richard.</i></font>

397
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:36,385
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was supposed to be you.</i></font>

398
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:41,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

399
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on. Again?</font>

400
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:11,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good grief.</font>
