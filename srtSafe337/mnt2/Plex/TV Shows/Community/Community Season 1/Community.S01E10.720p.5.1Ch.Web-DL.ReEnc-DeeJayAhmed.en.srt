to Envirodale.</font>

8
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:30,446

00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Yeah.</font>

10
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's also going to be
a free rock 'n' roll concert</font>

11
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,889

00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:47,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">That make you happy?</font>

13
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not really.</font>

14
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:50,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to re-do these.</font>

15
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">We printed 5000.</font>

22
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,395

23
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:55,566

to the dean.</font>

35

I accept.</font>

39

<font color="#FFFFFF">In a way, all of you are right.</font>

47
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:20,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was I tuning out?</font>

48
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to get Chang to
call off this homework.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one with the silver tongue.
Yeah, go tongue Chang.</font>

00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
I could convince Chang</font>

00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I can't even convince you
not to make me do it?</font>

00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:34,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff does raise a good point.</font>

53
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. You are convincing.</font>

54
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could do it.
Yeah.</font>

60
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you gonna keep pulling
a C in that psycho's class</font>

61
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he keeps assigning
this much work?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's your jacket. Let's do this.
Awesome, great.</font>

122
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,320

Yeah, but it didn't do any good.</font>

126
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">My still head hurts from the yelling.</font>

127
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pupils are more sensitive to light

128
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:28,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, now I feel bad
that we made you do that.</font>

129
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:30,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we can help with your essay.
Oh, that's okay.</font>

130
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:34,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm working on mine by myself.</font>

131
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,797

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you in class.</font>

133

137
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,741

<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy?</font>

139
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:55,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys seen a rat? Troy knocked
over Fievel's cage and he escaped.</font>

140
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed, I'm sorry.</font>

141
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably found more rats
and is very happy living with them.</font>

142
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to join the rest of us
in reality, Britta.</font>

143
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:12,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that, uh, fusing brownies
with the, uh, Internet</font>

144
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:16,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">is going to create the next Napster
for brownies.</font>

145
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yawn!</font>

146
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't I just write it on cards?</font>

147
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

148
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know anybody
who reads from cards?</font>

149
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No, you don't, and that's why.</font>

150
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:31,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, you might consider
a darker top.</font>

151
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Note taken.</font>

152
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:37,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and don't lock your knees.
Never lock your knees.</font>

153
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:40,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what happens when you
lock your knees? You die.</font>

154
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:45,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second, when you wanna drive home
a point, hand them a sandwich.</font>

155
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:47,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try it. Hand them
a sandwich. See?</font>

156
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hand them a sandwich.
Yeah.</font>

157
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except that you're...
You just dropped the sandwich</font>

158
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">as opposed to handing it to them.
Handing the palm.</font>

159
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:58,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Try attention-grabbing words
to wake up the audience, such as:</font>

160
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Multiple orgasm.</font>

161
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no. I don't think
that would fit into my message.</font>

162
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should focus more on...
Whatever.</font>

163
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and about these
filler words of yours.</font>

164
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
nobody wants to buy brownies</font>

165
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">from somebody that says
"um" and "like."</font>

166
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a method for fixing that.
From the top.</font>

167
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

168
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:21,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">These brownies are, uh...
Uh!</font>

169
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">They, um...
Um!</font>

170
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">These brownies are delicious.</font>

171
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">They taste like...
Like.</font>

172
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a filler word.
Whatever, valley girl.</font>

00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:10,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are dirty.
Dude.</font>

181
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:13,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still formal but plural</font>

182
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:17,354

neither are my friends.</font>

183
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:18,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

184
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on another subject, hope you guys
are working hard on your essays.</font>

185
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,134

it gets crazy.</font>

197
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:56,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I want to,
it's just the quiz, you know?</font>

198
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study, study.</font>

199
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how about this:</font>

200
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bling. A-plus. Nice work, Winger.</font>

201
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,101

208
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone should be disappointed,
it's me.</font>

209
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,162

someone out unless he helps them?</font>

210

<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of a person is asked to help
other people and then helps himself?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Helps himself?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's it, I'm out of here.</font>

216
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:55,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you breaking up with the group?
That's what you guys want.</font>

Yeah.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. This is so stupid.
No, no, no, it's fine, it's just...</font>

What?</font>

236
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I ask is for you to keep filling
the void in my soul.</font>

237
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:05,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to

Something like that, you know.</font>

242
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,106

That's mine.</font>

Okay.</font>

245
