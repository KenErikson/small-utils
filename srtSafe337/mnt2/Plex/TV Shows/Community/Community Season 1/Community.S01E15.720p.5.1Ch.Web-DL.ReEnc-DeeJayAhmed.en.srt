Did you slip out for a quickie with Prof. Hot Stuff?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!
Heh.</font>

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't kidding. You know it's nice to
have a girlfriend with a sense of humor</font>

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one who recognizes good work.</font>

7
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, that's G.
That's the most important chord.</font>

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my mind, it...
It stands for God.</font>

9
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Annie talking
to Micro-Nipples?</font>

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaughn? Whatever.</font>

11
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not like a Bible God because
I think that God is in everything.</font>

have the power of kicks.</font>

23
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:57,815

00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring the popcorn.
Cool.</font>

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... You... You watch bad movies
on purpose?</font>

26
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we make fun of them.
Hmm.</font>

27
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, don't embarrass yourself.
I'm sure they don't want to invite the housewife.</font>

28
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, if she doesn't mind
reinforcing the stereotype,</font>

29
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:12,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet Shirley would have fun talking
smack in a movie. Care to join us?</font>

30
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:15,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually when a movie's bad, I stop
watching, but this sounds college-y.</font>

31
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time do you want us there?</font>

32
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:22,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you don't wanna watch
a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm.</font>

33
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna lay in your twin bed
and think about what you used to be.</font>

34
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you think I'm too old to make
monkeyshines at a picture show?</font>

35
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'm younger
than the three of you put together.</font>

36
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Britta.</font>

37
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, everyone talks about his

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Hey.</font>

40
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you something?
About Vaughn?</font>

41
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, I still don't know
if that's his first or last name.</font>

42
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:59,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a sincerity
I found attractive in a simpler time.</font>

43
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you...? Um, I haven't...</font>

44
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't... Anything.</font>

45
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean...
Wow, you and Vaughn?</font>

46
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it bug you?</font>

47
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what about you and Troy?
Troy?</font>

48
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other day after Spanish, I thought
he was trying to hold my hand</font>

49
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he had just mistaken me
for Abed. Heh.</font>

50
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never think of me that way.</font>

51
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Annie, I would have to be a
villain to tell you who to date.</font>

52
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I am not.</font>

53
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, thank you.</font>

54
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the coolest girl I've ever met.</font>

55
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn right, give me some fivesies.</font>

56
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh.
Whoo.</font>

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turning it into a snake.</font>

58
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool.</font>

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how's it going? Did you hear?</font>

60
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cute, Annie and Vaughn.
Get to the cute part.</font>

61
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's into him.
She asked for my blessing.</font>

62
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you gave it?
Yeah, I'm done with him.</font>

63
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this isn't about you,
you groovy hipster.</font>

64
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about Annie.</font>

65
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like her Greendale parents,
you gotta say no to that stuff.</font>

66
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not that bad.</font>

67
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, not if you're 28
and you're fooling around with him.</font>

68
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's 18. Her taste in men
is still being established.</font>

69
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creepier and creepier dudes
will start thinking of her as an option.</font>

70
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it all starts with Vaughn.
He's a gateway douche bag.</font>

71
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">People collide, things happen.
It can't be controlled, right?</font>

72
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that can be your toast at her
shotgun wedding to Star-Burns.</font>

73
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, turn to your left.
Oh, now turn to your right.</font>

74
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we can see both of them.
It's like a constellation on your face.</font>

75
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Oh, what's up, dude? Yeah.</font>

76
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy over there?
He's a douche bag.</font>

77
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

78
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you don't mind I invited
Señor Chang, we're Netflix friends.</font>

drinking beers with your students.</font>

80
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, clearly none of my other plans
fell through.</font>

81
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get to the movie.</font>

82
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait... Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley.</font>

83
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wait
if you wanna serve beverages.</font>

84
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,614

a long ass time.</font>

85
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,421

<font color="#FFFFFF">Crash course in manipulation.</font>

145
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't actually tell the person
what you want them to do.</font>

146
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">You help them realize
they want to do it</font>

147
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">so it can't be traced back to you.</font>

148
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Got it.</font>

149
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chemistry, sexy.</font>

150
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what else is sexy?
Annie.</font>

151
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Chemistry is sexy,
but Annie? I don't see it.</font>

152
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, every other guy
on campus does.</font>

153
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really don't see
how pretty Annie is?</font>

154
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's because I knew her back in
high school before she dropped out.</font>

155
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had braces and acne
and a pill addiction.</font>

156
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">A nervous breakdown
ending with her running</font>

157
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,109

158
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Everyone's a robot."</font>

159
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see what's happening here.</font>

160
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I want you to clear your head.
Done.</font>

161
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna describe to you
a complete stranger</font>

162
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">who happens who happens to be
in our study group.</font>

163
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you excuse us
for a moment?</font>

164
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie?</font>

165
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">No kidding?</font>

166
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
you gotta be exaggerating.</font>

167
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

168
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.
And she's Jewish?</font>

169
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I didn't see that.</font>

170
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess she deserves
another shot.</font>

171
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait. Never mind, it's too late, I
heard she's hooking up with Vaughn.</font>

172
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only to make you jealous.
What?</font>

173
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's helplessly in love with you, she's
only with Vaughn to get your attention.</font>

174
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you have to give it to her now,
right, Jeff?</font>

175
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

176
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the point is
we're not telling you what to do.</font>

177
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah,
you didn't hear it from us.</font>

178
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo-ya.</font>

179
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the weirdest boner.</font>

180
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,976
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I saw you die.</i></font>

181
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,012
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How can you be alive?</i></font>

182
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,549
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I guess it's just a bad day
for drug-dealing terrorists.</i></font>

183
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,450
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And a good day for Kickpuncher.</i></font>

184
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys, you hear that pause</font>

185
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">after he says, "And a good day,"
What do you got for me there?</font>

186
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good day
for a nutritious breakfast.</font>

187
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.
It's a good day for a terrible movie.</font>

188
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good day for hair products?</font>

189
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Buzz, how many times can you
keep going to go to that well?</font>

190
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, I'm starting
to wonder if you deserve</font>

191
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">to call yourselves a community
college sketch comedy troupe.</font>

192
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, on movie night I need to
blow these punks out of the water.</font>

193
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.</font>

194
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't you rather just watch a movie
with your friends and have a good time?</font>

195
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you,
my third wife's therapist?</font>

196
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he said, "It's a good day for,"
And you said, "For being gay?"</font>

197
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a genius.</font>

198
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes gay jokes.</font>

199
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
I said we write great jokes.</font>

200
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't flatter yourselves.</font>

201
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

202
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:53,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Annie, it's me, Troy.</font>

203
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know where Abed is.
I can try calling him if you want.</font>

204
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not looking
for my other half.</font>

205
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for you, girl.</font>

206
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

207
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let that sink in
for a second.</font>

208
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

209
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I never noticed
how beautiful you are.</font>

210
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, you're being weird.</font>

211
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry it took me so long.
They made me find a s-shirt.</font>

212
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaughn, you remember Troy.</font>

213
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, we went to high school together
and he's in my study group.</font>

214
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up, man? Hi, bro.
Heh.</font>

215
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your bro, bro.</font>

216
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, actually,
everyone is my bro</font>

217
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the whole entire universe
because everything is connected.</font>

218
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rocks, eagles, hats.</font>

219
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but some things
are more connected than others</font>

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">like tarantulas
and me peeing my pants.</font>

221
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or me and Annie.
What, wait.</font>

222
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy? What?</font>

223
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him. Tell him that you've been
in love with me since high school.</font>

224
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

225
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute,
is that true, Mountain Flower?</font>

226
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

227
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean... Ugh.</font>

228
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never wanna lie to you.</font>

229
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I will tell you, I did have feelings
for him but it's over, I swear.</font>

230
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swear? Like Britta swore
that she didn't like Jeff.</font>

231
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then gave him a copy of my poem so he could
laugh at me with that Sherri Shepherd lady?</font>

232
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening again.</font>

233
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your study group is evil.</font>

234
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't deserve ice cream.</font>

235
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's a baby.
Now, where were we?</font>

236
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! I like him.
Why would you do that?</font>

237
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everybody knows you want
a cut of the T-Bone steak.</font>

238
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.
Jeff and Britta told me how you feel.</font>

239
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Jeff and Britta did what now?</font>

240
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're even hotter
when you're angry.</font>

241
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this.</font>

242
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,306
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Red Shoe Diaries.</i></font>

243
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you know I have a thing
for butt stuff.</font>

244
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:57,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Annie's inevitable breakup
with Grodie J. McConaughey.</font>

245
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to her and Troy.</font>

246
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did the right thing.
They belong together.</font>

247
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:05,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, their babies will be so cute.</font>

248
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you say that?
Come on.</font>

249
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that babies are extra cute
when the parents are...</font>

250
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both cute?</font>

251
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want kids?
We'll see.</font>

252
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put on something nice
and find me after lunch.</font>

253
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Thanks for getting
involved in my love life.</font>

254
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was super cool and mature
of you.</font>

255
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and since
you're both clearly idiots,</font>

256
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should probably let you know
that I'm being sarcastic.</font>

257
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, thanks for taking ugly
Annie out of the palm of my hand.</font>

258
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And turning her into yet another
hottie that will never get with me.</font>

259
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, thanks for eating
all the macaroni.</font>

260
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Leonard, nobody even
knows what you're talking about.</font>

261
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:53,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did eat all the macaroni.
It's messed up that he knows.</font>

unanswered questions.</font>

268

fight mechanical spiders.</font>

Yeah.</font>

went haywire and tore him to pieces.</font>

273

274
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then,
let's watch your Kickpuncher 2 then.</font>

275
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Okay.</font>

276
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry for your loss.
Yeah. That's messed up, dude.</font>

282
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,264

we better change its diaper. Heh.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you're doing it
with the speed and determination</font>

288
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the incomparable
Robin Williams.</font>

289
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Maybe I'm just that brilliant.</font>

290
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you came prepared.</font>

291
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, even I know you're lame.</font>

292
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm a tenured professor
sitting in a beanbag chair.</font>

293
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a professor.
Shut up, man.</font>

294
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, you got me.</font>

295
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did a little advanced work.</font>

296
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pathetic? No.
I'll tell you what's pathetic.</font>

297
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all sitting here making fun
of other people's work.</font>

298
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't feel good about
yourselves</font>

299
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you have to tear down
everything around you.</font>

300
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter?
Mama Chang didn't breastfeed?</font>

301
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">She read in a book that
it wouldn't make a difference.</font>

302
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all sicken me.</font>

303
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will no longer participate in
your destructive, negative behavior.</font>

304
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, that was deep.</font>

305
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">And total BS.
Yeah, this isn't about us.</font>

306
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a deflection because
you can't get a genuine laugh.</font>

307
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.
That, in itself, is a laugh.</font>

308
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I'm funny
and I don't need</font>

309
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">any of you people to validate me.
Hmm.</font>

310
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh!</font>

311
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

312
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biggest laugh of the night.</font>

313
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it was.
Totally.</font>

314
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I was going to say,
"It's a good day to be gay."</font>

315
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.</font>

316
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry, we were worried
about your well-being.</font>

317
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we feel
like we're sort of all a family.</font>

318
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Jeff and I are like
your Greendale parents.</font>

319
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not my mom, Britta.
She would never wear boots that go up that high.</font>

320
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about respecting me
as an adult and as a friend?</font>

321
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. You want to be treated
as an adult and a friend?</font>

322
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try not dating your friend's ex-boyfriend.
Find your man.</font>

323
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my.
Oh, boy.</font>

324
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't like Vaughn.</font>

325
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't, but I also don't like
seeing him with anyone else. Ta-da!</font>

326
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you if you cared
and you said no.</font>

327
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. I cared. I'm a girly girl. I like boys.
I don't like it when they're mean to me.</font>

328
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like it when they stop kissing me and
start kissing my friends. I'm not that cool.</font>

329
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?</font>

330
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what it was about for you?
You were jealous?</font>

331
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please, you can't tell me
that you weren't jealous</font>

332
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Vaughn had his hands all over
your debatelmake-out partner.</font>

333
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you insinuating?
I took that kiss for the team.</font>

334
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

335
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. That kiss wasn't for pleasure.
It was strategic and joyless.</font>

336
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Yeah.</font>

337
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did get weirdly specific when
you were describing Annie's body.</font>

338
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">More specific than the stuff
you told me about Britta?</font>

339
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

340
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone get specific about me?
Check your e-mail.</font>

341
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I marked you as spam.
Who the hell is Pam?</font>

342
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you guys first came in,</font>

343
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,686
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>we were as wholesome and healthy as
the family in Brady Bunch.</i></font>

344
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,261
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And now we're as dysfunctional and incestuous
as the cast of The Brady Bunch.</i></font>

345
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree with Abed,
this is getting creepy.</font>

346
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more creepy than
when Jeff wears tight jeans</font>

347
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you say, "I'd like to slap
those buns on the grill."</font>

348
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
First, I don't talk like that.</font>

349
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second of all, where I'm from,</font>

350
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's perfectly normal for women to talk
about their male friends' backsides.</font>

351
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't see me saying anything crazy about,
uh, Abed and Troy's weird, little relationship.</font>

352
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just jealous.</font>

353
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right, maybe we're not a
family. Maybe it's more complicated.</font>

354
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because unlike a real family,</font>

355
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing to stop any one of us
from looking at any of the others</font>

356
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a sexual prospect.</font>

357
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we even talking
about this?</font>

358
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you started having sex
with Britta's ex-boyfriend.</font>

359
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? We haven't even kissed.</font>

360
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean
you're not having sex.</font>

361
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaughn told me he would take things
as slowly as I wanted.</font>

362
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes me for who I am
and I like him.</font>

363
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys hear that?</font>

364
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.
Vaughn.</font>

365
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.
Hi.</font>

366
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old man river.
Eat me.</font>

367
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get my messages?
No.</font>

368
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I threw my phone into the river.</font>

369
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that, "You know, if I can't
be with her, who am I gonna call?"</font>

370
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:26,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I thought, you know, well,
my landlord and my sister and you.</font>

371
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I've been doing
a lot of soul searching,</font>

372
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is something
I really need to say.</font>

373
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:40,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I see you when you smile
And I want to sing a song ♪</font>

374
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:45,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ But then I write the words
And they always come out wrong ♪</font>

375
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ They come out wrong ♪</font>

376
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:53,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes ♪</font>

377
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ But then the words get frozen
In my mouth like Eskimos ♪</font>

378
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I like your nose ♪</font>

379
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:08,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</font>

380
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:15,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Annie Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</font>

381
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Annie's song ♪♪</font>

382
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">His songs are dumber than he is.</font>

383
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but they're honest.</font>

384
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right here.</font>

385
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaughn wants to show me a cloud
that looks like a pumpkin. Heh.</font>

386
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's okay.</font>

387
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, it's more than okay.
Please date Vaughn.</font>

388
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or anyone else
outside this creepy circle.</font>

389
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't hang out with you guys
if you were creepy.</font>

390
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, I have good taste.</font>

391
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you smell like boysenberries.</font>

392
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">So just to be clear,
I don't have a shot with any of you?</font>

393
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.
Oh, my God.</font>

394
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dizzy.</font>

395
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Kickpuncher.</font>

396
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cyber punches
have the power of kicks. Mm, mm.</font>

397
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Punchkicker, meet your match.</font>

398
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, Kickpuncher.</font>

399
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing
beyond the reach of my fists</font>

400
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">is humanity.
Mm-mm.</font>

401
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure
Britta couldn't do your part?</font>

402
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I asked
her, she wasn't available.</font>

403
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go film the sex scene.</font>
