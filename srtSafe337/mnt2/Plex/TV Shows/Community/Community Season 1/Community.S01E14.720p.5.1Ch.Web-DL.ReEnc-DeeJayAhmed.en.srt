1
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:08,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we start, I'd like to have a
preliminary powwow, or prelimi-wow,</font>

2
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what I'm calling
our library's back door conundrum.</font>

3
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like a porno
with Kate Winslet.</font>

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, ew.</font>

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">The door on that side
is locked after 5,</font>

6
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means that most us have
to walk all the way around.</font>

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if we were to move
our meetings to 4:30...</font>

8
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

9
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:27,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a regular class at that time.</font>

10
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:30,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like Math
or other regular classes.</font>

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I have something
unimportant that can't ever move.</font>

12
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe one of us could stand by
the back door and let the rest in?</font>

13
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. I nominate Pierce.
Where is he?</font>

14
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have not seen him around all day.</font>

15
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't either.</font>

16
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone called him?
I did.</font>

17
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Several times, actually.
But he never returned my calls.</font>

18
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

19
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. The last thing I said to him
was, "Suck it."</font>

20
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:52,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.
Good morning.</font>

21
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha.
Yes.</font>

22
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.
Whew.</font>

23
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought I was dead, didn't you?</font>

24
00:00:58,385 --> 00:00:59,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I did.</font>

25
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you people have any idea
how emasculating that is?</font>

26
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:03,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Mickey Rooney.</font>

27
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:06,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to cross your
fingers to see if I'll show up.</font>

28
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:09,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when I was 30, people used
to wish that I was dead to my face.</font>

29
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:11,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's called respect.</font>

30
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Who is the lucky brunette?</font>

31
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last name Beeswax,
first name Nunnuyuh.</font>

32
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my third wife was biracial.</font>

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.
I am trying to keep you out of trouble.</font>

34
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the next girl saw these?
Well, then</font>

35
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">she would know it was hers.</font>

36
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you're sleeping with a woman
you already slept with?</font>

37
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't I be the friend in the group whose
trademark is his well-defined boundaries?</font>

38
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:38,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Privacy Smurf, Discreet Bear
or Confidentiality Spice?</font>

39
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you keep her a secret?
Don't you want us to meet her?</font>

40
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an agreement
to keep it low-key.</font>

41
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous.
Obviously, it's a guy.</font>

42
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong, Pierce.
It's two guys.</font>

43
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I do wish you were dead.</font>

44
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

45
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up, man? Boo!</font>

46
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:05,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up, J-Dog?</font>

47
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.</font>

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up, man? What's up?</font>

49
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.</font>

50
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, and step into place.</font>

51
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:31,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six, seven, eight, and reach.
Two, three, four, pose.</font>

52
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reach back and arm.</font>

53
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Slater, quick question.</font>

54
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:38,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the answer.
I don't date students.</font>

55
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:40,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you are no longer
in my Statistics class.</font>

56
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm actually kind of seeing someone
right now, thank you very much.</font>

57
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:46,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? How's that going?
Fine for now. She's smart, pretty.</font>

58
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:50,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sometimes I feel like she's just waiting
for me to stop talking and take off my pants.</font>

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is.</font>

60
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been
someone's dirty little secret.</font>

61
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never had a dirty secret.</font>

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so unprofessional.</font>

63
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the sneaking does make
the sex 38 percent hotter.</font>

64
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, you do like statistics,
don't you?</font>

65
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, midterms and whatever.
Chalk.</font>

66
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Slater,
there's that transcript you wanted.</font>

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I didn't expect to see you here.
Hopefully I'm not interrupting.</font>

68
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we laugh,</font>

69
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the fact is, student-teacher
relationships do happen.</font>

70
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they are a magnet for lawsuits,
so we do stay vigilant.</font>

71
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, physically attractive
students and faculty</font>

72
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:33,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">are actually placed on a watch list.</font>

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are ranked by their potential
to incite fraternization.</font>

74
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:37,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You rank people
by how hot they are?</font>

75
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:40,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it, number two.</font>

76
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Pelton.
Yes, Professor Seven... Uh, Slater?</font>

77
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll return this tomorrow.
Okay, then.</font>

78
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys be extra careful now.</font>

79
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:50,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two people of your rankings
in this small a room,</font>

80
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:53,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">with this type of lighting,
and his upper body</font>

81
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:56,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what her heels and hemline
are doing to enhance</font>

82
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">what were already
quite a few favors from God,</font>

83
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:02,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's all the more important
to keep it tasteful. Heh.</font>

84
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he might have ruined...
It's dead.</font>

85
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:17,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.</font>

86
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arm, head, and pose.</font>

87
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:23,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait for the recital.
You were all wonderful.</font>

88
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:26,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially you, Troy.
Thank you, Madame LeClair.</font>

89
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if any of you mention
my dancing outside of class,</font>

90
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:36,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will break off your legs and use
them to smash in your friends' cars.</font>

91
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:39,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Huh!</font>

92
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, since when have you taken
modern dance?</font>

94
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:52,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since last semester. Coach told me
it would help with my coordination.</font>

95
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I fell in love with it,
in a very straight way.</font>

96
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's tempting
to sneak a peek,</font>

97
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:00,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna need for you to keep
your eyes up here.</font>

98
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have never dismissed you
as a shallow jock.</font>

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then again, we haven't really spent
much time together.</font>

100
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because you don't
play football or have fun.</font>

101
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:11,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have fun tap dancing.
I started last semester too.</font>

102
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was always something
I wanted to do,</font>

103
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:16,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was too embarrassing,
so I never told anyone.</font>

104
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same here.</font>

105
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:22,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, nobody can know about this.
Troy, who are we kidding?</font>

106
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at how much time and energy
we're putting into hiding something</font>

107
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we're passionate about.
We are leading a double life.</font>

108
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am spending a lot of money
on breakaway clothing.</font>

109
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:34,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should look at this
as an opportunity to come clean.</font>

110
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying we tell the group?
Together?</font>

111
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could invite them
to the dance recital on Friday.</font>

112
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:44,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I don't know.
Let me think about it.</font>

113
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:52,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's do this. Ahem!
Sorry.</font>

114
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:55,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger.</font>

115
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you come to my office?
We never finished our intercourse.</font>

116
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have study group right now.</font>

117
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nobody uses "intercourse"
to mean anything other than sex.</font>

118
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this is a wall of windows.</font>

119
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">My study group's behind it.
I know.</font>

120
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:11,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, as soon as we touch,
the blinds will open,</font>

121
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">and six annoying but lovable misfits
will be staring at us.</font>

122
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, what are the odds?</font>

123
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:19,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

124
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, was that so bad?</font>

125
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, could you open the back door?</font>

126
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:44,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all remember Michelle Slater,
my professor from last semester.</font>

127
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">As most of you may have realized
by now,</font>

128
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:50,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's the woman
I've been seeing lately.</font>

129
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they looking at me
like I'm a zoo animal?</font>

130
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff acts
as sort of the dad of the group.</font>

131
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, emotionally, this is like
being told you're our new mom.</font>

132
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know
it's nothing like that, right?</font>

133
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely. You cook macaroni?</font>

134
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have.
Macaroni's my favorite.</font>

135
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">The important thing is
we all understand</font>

136
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Slater and I need this
to be our little secret.</font>

137
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone understand that?
Yes.</font>

138
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, my macaroni noodle
is so good.</font>

139
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, sure.
The pepper jack,</font>

140
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you bake it.
See? All good.</font>

141
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:21,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.</font>

142
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:23,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should get going.
Yeah.</font>

143
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:24,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
Ooh.</font>

144
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.
Bye.</font>

145
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:36,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Jeff, you've taken a big step
in knocking down the barriers</font>

146
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">between students and teachers.
It's like Rosa Parks.</font>

147
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it's like that.
No, it's just like that.</font>

148
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel if you need to explain it,
it's not just like that.</font>

149
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:49,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your heart gonna be okay
with this?</font>

150
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will try to find the tools to survive.
Okay.</font>

151
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everybody,
speaking of secrets,</font>

152
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:57,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and I have something</font>

153
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we would like to announce.
Aah!</font>

154
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. There is a dance recital
on Friday,</font>

155
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I would be honored
if you guys would attend.</font>

156
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because since last semester, I</font>

157
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">have been taking a tap class.</font>

158
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's funny.</font>

159
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:16,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know how funny it is.</font>

160
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:20,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, we're not making fun of you,
but, obviously, you kept it a secret</font>

161
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:22,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you saw the irony too.
Irony?</font>

162
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're not a typically
vulnerable or feminine person.</font>

163
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:28,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the act of dancing is considered
both vulnerable and feminine.</font>

164
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:31,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I disagree. What about Fred Astaire?
What about Baryshnikov?</font>

165
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess.
There are exceptions to the rule.</font>

166
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,274
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But even when Jerry Rice went
on Dancing With the Stars...</i></font>

167
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry Rice? Oh, my God.</font>

168
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I liked him.</font>

169
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:45,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, what's your secret?</font>

170
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

171
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:53,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">M-my secret is that</font>

172
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew Britta's secret.</font>

173
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I saw her in her dance outfit
and she looked ridiculous.</font>

174
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:04,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I helped her protect her shame.
You know, I'm just glad she's out now.</font>

175
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bravo, Britta.
Thanks.</font>

176
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, there you are.</font>

177
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just got word of your relationship
with Professor Slater.</font>

178
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:14,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to see both of you in my office
in half an hour.</font>

179
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:17,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of you left the room.
How is that even possible?</font>

180
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, for one thing,
it's all over Twitter.</font>

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta in a tutu. Can you imagine?
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

182
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. What the hell?</font>

183
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were supposed
to come out to the group together.</font>

184
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:34,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I changed my mind.</font>

185
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're gonna find out
that you dance at the recital.</font>

186
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:39,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna be in the recital.
I'm dropping the class.</font>

187
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:43,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, how can you do this
to me? I'm so disappointed in you.</font>

188
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you don't get to talk to me
like that. You are not Shirley.</font>

189
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Shirley's not my mom.</font>

190
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, it's not like
we were in the same boat.</font>

191
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls are supposed to dance.</font>

192
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why God gave them parts
that jiggle.</font>

193
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:59,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd be going from starting quarterback
to a guy that twirls around in tights.</font>

194
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got way more to lose getting
up on that stage because I'm a man.</font>

195
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:03,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what?</font>

196
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real man doesn't bail
on his friends, or on himself.</font>

197
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:11,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a dancer, Troy.
It's who you are.</font>

198
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

199
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
Whoa.</font>

200
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

201
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Upset about Jeff?</font>

202
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I am upset about</font>

203
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">something I can't talk about.</font>

204
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:33,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could talk about anything.
Politics, medicine, Jeff.</font>

205
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, uh, did you hear that the
Shroud of Turin is actually...?</font>

206
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing about Jeff.
Wow.</font>

207
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:43,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chasing after you made him a better person
because you always call him on his stuff.</font>

208
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this time, you've been warming
him up and stirring in sweetener,</font>

209
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:47,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">and making him just right.</font>

210
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sure,
you weren't ready to take a sip yet.</font>

211
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it didn't mean you want somebody
to snatch him off the counter,</font>

212
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:52,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">guzzle him down
in front of you.</font>

213
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:57,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.
Nobody ever will.</font>

214
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think Professor Slater
is getting flowers right now?</font>

215
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:03,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think they are gonna go
to the movies and hold hands?</font>

216
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Visit her parents? No.</font>

217
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing keeping them going
was the thrill of the secrecy.</font>

218
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:11,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now that it is out, it is over.
Believe me.</font>

219
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:16,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can... Can I just ask,
as a divorced, black housewife?</font>

220
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:20,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">What part of being a single, white
slacker makes you people so jaded?</font>

221
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:24,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. "You people"?
What do you mean, "you people"?</font>

222
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot believe I got to say that.</font>

223
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh-heh.
It's the little things, isn't it?</font>

224
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well,
now that your secret is out there,</font>

225
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:34,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna talk you through this
teacher-student relationship form,</font>

226
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we can get you two
on your very attractive way.</font>

227
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't even admitted
to being a couple.</font>

228
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, this is all based on hearsay.
Worse than hearsay.</font>

229
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce's Twitter account,
in which he says he's 47,</font>

230
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">and teaches
a women's-only Pilates class.</font>

231
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, it's okay. It's out.</font>

232
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what?
It doesn't bother me.</font>

233
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happy.
Sweet.</font>

234
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. First question.
How long have you been doing it?</font>

235
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, not "it." I mean, this, dating.</font>

236
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few weeks.
Mm-hm.</font>

237
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:08,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how long
have you been doing it?</font>

238
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:11,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have to answer that.
Oh, it's... Hmm?</font>

239
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is just hypothetical.</font>

240
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might you ever consider spending
the night with a third person?</font>

241
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:21,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not on there.
Uh...</font>

242
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, it's on there.</font>

243
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:26,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just exploring your options,
obviously. Heh-heh-heh.</font>

244
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:29,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">No agenda. I'll put TBD.</font>

245
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:32,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you describe yourself
as boyfriend and girlfriend?</font>

246
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Eh...</font>

247
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Oh, boy.</font>

248
00:12:36,015 --> 00:12:38,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's semantics, really, isn't it?</font>

249
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've slept together every night
for the last three weeks.</font>

250
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:45,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you describe me?
The best friend ever.</font>

251
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

252
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh... I guess
I've had the wrong idea about us.</font>

253
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:56,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, this is good.
I'd be better off dating, um, an adult.</font>

254
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:58,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you around.
Michelle.</font>

255
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rowr.</font>

256
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the breakup form.</font>

257
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:15,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got freaked out
by that boyfriend label.</font>

258
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:18,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid of commitment.</font>

259
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">How original.
Look,</font>

260
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">the biggest truths
aren't original.</font>

261
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:24,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truth is ketchup, it's Jim Belushi.</font>

262
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Its job isn't to blow our minds,
it's to be within reach.</font>

263
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the truth is, I get claustrophobic
when things get official.</font>

264
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:33,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're acting like
I'm a Venus flytrap.</font>

265
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want or need more
than what we were doing.</font>

266
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get back to it.
Should I get the door?</font>

267
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't now because
you went to the friend place.</font>

268
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's you getting official, not me.</font>

269
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because unless there's something
I need to know about the lunch lady,</font>

270
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">or that blond in your Spanish class with
the infinite supply of leather jackets,</font>

271
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">somewhere between
our ninth and 11 th slumber party,</font>

272
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">statistically speaking, most people
would call us more than pals.</font>

273
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but soon as you say it,
it can get complicated and messy.</font>

274
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?
Because when you say it,</font>

275
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">later on,
you might have to unsay it.</font>

276
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoopee flipping ding, Winger.
It happens 50 million times a day.</font>

277
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Jim Belushi
of sexual commitments.</font>

278
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">It barely means anything, and it
grows on what's there over time.</font>

279
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that guy is really taking a
pounding in this conversation.</font>

280
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you around, Jeff.</font>

281
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really liked what we were doing.</font>

282
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the ratio of work to pleasure
can really stay at that same level,</font>

283
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what it's called,
I'll do it.</font>

284
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

285
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

286
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

287
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. That's a big crowd
out there. Heh.</font>

288
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's really good at inviting people.</font>

289
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:05,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all here to support you.
Jeff even brought his girlfriend.</font>

290
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:09,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she's his girlfriend now?
Can't wait till he hears about it.</font>

291
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he knows. They even had to
file paperwork with the dean.</font>

292
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty serious.</font>

293
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our little Jeff's growing up. Ha.</font>

294
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

295
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break a leg, Britta.</font>

296
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea how someone could do
what you're about to do. Heh-heh.</font>

297
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought Goobers.
Anybody want a Goober?</font>

298
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:32,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get them while they're goobie.</font>

299
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Showtime.</font>

300
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is already ridiculous.
Shh.</font>

301
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tea for Two"? There...
There's five people.</font>

302
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

303
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord.</font>

304
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?
Shh.</font>

305
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of you think the flowers
are dying from the tea?</font>

306
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

307
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone can hear you.</font>

308
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:36,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

309
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:44,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water it.</font>

310
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:48,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?
So embarrassing.</font>

311
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, plot twist.</font>

312
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:02,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy girl. There we go.
Uh...</font>

313
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:04,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Ah! Uh...</font>

314
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

315
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

316
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:09,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Play something modern.</font>

317
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
Being a friend and a man.</font>

318
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

319
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...</font>

320
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah-aah!</font>

321
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:36,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

322
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:43,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Culturally, it's unacceptable,
but it's theatrical dynamite.</font>

323
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah.</font>

324
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:57,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!
Bravo.</font>

325
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo.
Yeah, all right. Greendale.</font>

326
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale.</font>

327
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, guys. That was really cool.
I wish I knew how to tap dance.</font>

328
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Thanks, Abed.</font>

329
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes a lot of hard work,
but you could take a class.</font>

330
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, pass.</font>

331
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:20,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Troy, thank you.</font>

332
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.
I mean, you looked so pathetic,</font>

333
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">you made going up there
the most masculine option.</font>

334
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

335
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy. Oh.</font>

336
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you did up there
really took guts.</font>

337
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm impressed.
Thanks, Pierce.</font>

338
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:41,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And such a creative way
to tell the world you're gay.</font>

339
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job up there.
Thank you.</font>

340
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your date?
Didn't she wanna get my autograph?</font>

341
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:50,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. She's getting a permission slip from the
dean to allow us to drive home together.</font>

342
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:53,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heard you guys are official now.
Yeah, I guess.</font>

343
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You actually had a big part in that.</font>

344
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if I can handle
having a girl for a friend,</font>

345
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:01,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's to say I'm not ready
for a girlfriend?</font>

346
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes perfect sense. Break a leg.</font>

347
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flowers.
Yeah.</font>

348
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, is that...?
That's what people do, right?</font>

349
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna throw them up on stage,
but I thought they might catch fire.</font>

350
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is... This is good.
You can hand them to me. Thank you.</font>

351
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you Monday.
Bye.</font>

352
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, everybody.</font>

353
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,421
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Five letters, Broadway musical.
Annie.</i></font>

354
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:01,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, six letters, to puncture.
Pierce.</font>

355
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:04,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, a water filter that starts with B.
Britta.</font>

356
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. There's a tough one, though.</font>

357
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Helen of...
Troy.</font>

358
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:09,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, damn, you're good.
Thank you.</font>

359
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:11,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never even heard
of that last one.</font>

360
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, uh, one of the two
brother actors, Bridges,</font>

361
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">four letters.</font>

362
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.
I know. Bridges.</font>

363
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Come on, guys,</font>

364
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:21,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">can't you see the pattern there?</font>

365
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:24,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you see it?
It's Beau, Beau Bridges.</font>

366
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are all things
you can see on TV.</font>

367
00:20:27,486 --> 00:20:28,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for pierce, that's a misdirect.</font>

368
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Oh.</font>

369
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I love misdirects.
