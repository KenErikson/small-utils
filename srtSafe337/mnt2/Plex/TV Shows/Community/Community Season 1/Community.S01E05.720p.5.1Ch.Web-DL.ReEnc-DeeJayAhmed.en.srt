my dry-witted friend?</font>

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:39,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably the same as teacher life,
but less tragic, cause I get to leave.</font>

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very dry. Very witty.
Not a great friend.</font>

14

about that lady in your Spanish class.</font>

Can you imagine?</font>

19
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

20
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,170

and if so,</font>

21
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">would that item

- Cause he called me on my cell phone.</font>

34

But it's time to tell you everything...</font>

38
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:56,266

on the study group sheet was fake,</font>

39
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:58,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I learned
in the awkward conclusion</font>

40

I'm sure you wanna know how you did.</font>

50

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna tell you.</font>

51
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,382

54
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:39,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a tiny piece of paper, okay?
That's all it is. Tiny piece of paper.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Containing all the information
covered on the test.</font>

56

<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise known as a crib sheet.</font>

57
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:47,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did it?</font>

58
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marianne?</font>

59
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:51,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandpa?</font>

60

61
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kumar? There's one asian stereotype
that does apply to me.</font>

62
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever did this insulted my honor.</font>

63
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,664

to come forward,</font>

64
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:07,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">or Mr. Miyagi here
will wax off everyone's score</font>

65
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the whole class gets a <i>cero</i>!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">'cept you, Toby.</font>

67

between <i>señor</i> Chang and Stalin</font>

68
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that I know who <i>señor</i> Chang is.</font>

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear him call me Jackee
like I'm some black female caricature?</font>

70
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">If God hadn't been watching,
I'd have slapped him.</font>

71
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you guys think cheated?</font>

72
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flattering.
But if I'm gonna cheat,</font>

73
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna write information
onto a paper.</font>

74
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's practically learning.</font>

75
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever made that crib sheet
wasn't a cheater.</font>

76
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... insecure and naive.</font>

77
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:49,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be naive, but I'm not stupid.</font>

78

<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be stupid, but I'm not trying
to look like I'm not.</font>

79
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:57,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be a genius,
but I'm not a lesbian.</font>

80
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?</font>

81
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only cheater is the guy
who's threatening everyone with a zero.</font>

82
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right! It's so unfair.
I can't handle this stress right now.</font>

83
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already overwhelmed by my duties
on the school song committee.</font>

84
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a musician?</font>

85
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:15,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hired a local composer.
But he's quite a handful.</font>

86
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that's your fault.</font>

87
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a pianist and songwriter
sitting 3 feet away from you.</font>

88

for Hawthorne Wipe's moist towelettes.</font>

92
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been racist this whole time</font>

93
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:37,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I'm telling everybody at church
what a sweet caramel angel you are?</font>

94
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:41,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stuff I said this morning wasn't true.
I was just messin' with you.</font>

95
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:43,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were lying?
- As a joke.</font>

96
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never had anybody mess with you?
- Yes. Just kidding. No. Like that?</font>

97
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a table.</font>

98
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's funny.</font>

99
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember
when we used to study Spanish?</font>

100
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:03,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to the Dean,
he said you can write the school song.</font>

101
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:07,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, that's more like it.
- The statue dedication is this Friday.</font>

102
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you have to have it done by then.
- This Friday?</font>

103
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If that's not enough time...
- You don't know much about genius.</font>

104
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I can do it by Friday.
- Great!</font>

105
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:20,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a piano in the rehearsal space.
I'll help you out however I can.</font>

106
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're gonna do an awesome job!
- I know!</font>

107
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... this is the last chance</font>

108
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the cheater to be an adult</font>

109
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">and face <i>la musica</i>...</font>

110
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or everyone fails.</font>

111
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got ten seconds...</font>

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,000

113
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never... gotten a zero before.</font>

114
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:53,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it.</font>

115
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took your time with that one.</font>

116
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you terrorize a class
by threatening their grades.</font>

117

<font color="#FFFFFF">Real mature!</font>

120
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:10,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

121
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are mature!</font>

122
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too mature to sit in a class</font>

123
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:17,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a cheating, lying poop-face!</font>

124
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to learn some formal greetings.</font>

125
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you're enjoying this.</font>

126
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we first met, like you were up here
and I was here, and now...</font>

127
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave a quarter
to a dirty bum today.</font>

You would be Britta Perry.</font>

131
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just spoke with <i>señor</i> Chang,</font>

132
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm afraid Greendale
takes this kinda thing very seriously.</font>

133
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much like a university would!</font>

134
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your case will be reviewed</font>

yes, but we will be next to it,</font>

00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">and send me
into fits of grateful arousal.</font>

147
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can neither confirm nor deny that.</font>

148
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">See how good I am?</font>

149
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy. Did you hear?</font>

150
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">All dogs are blue now.</font>

151
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single dog in the world
is blue.</font>

152
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm just messing with you.
- Let me explain to you</font>

153
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">a few things about how this works.</font>

154
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:08,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all, I cannot be got,
because I am not gullible like you.</font>

155
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secondly, you are not good at this,</font>

156
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you are not believable
in your face, okay?</font>

157
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your face? It's bad.</font>

158
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:17,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also...</font>

159
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta ride the line
between believable and...</font>

160
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:24,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you writing in?
- It's a notepad.</font>

161
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But what are... What language?
- Probably Arabic.</font>

162
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am convening
this disciplinary tribunal</font>

163
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">at our state-of-the-art
judge's table,</font>

164
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:46,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">which has its own built-in sound system
so take that yale.</font>

165
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our judges include myself,
Dean Craig Pelton.</font>

166
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Ian Duncan.</font>

167
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Ben Chang.</font>

168
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're a teacher.
Not a professor.</font>

169
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe because
I don't look like Ron Weasley.</font>

170
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the difference,
the qualifying factor.</font>

171
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, point of order.</font>

172
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:03,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can <i>señor</i> Chang
be one of the judges?</font>

173
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the one accusing my client.</font>

174
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got Prince Charles over here,
who's your drinking buddy.</font>

175
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:10,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got me.</font>

176
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds like there are two biases,
one on each side, and I go both ways.</font>

177
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:17,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's strike that.
Lashonda, can we please strike that?</font>

178
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am impartial,
so it should all work out.</font>

179
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:22,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin.</font>

180
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:26,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
The tribunal calls teacher Chang.</font>

181
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:30,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just keep it up <i>Frost/Nixon</i>.
- I was planning on doing that.</font>

182
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cleared my whole day.</font>

183
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you remind us
of the events of yesterday?</font>

184
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">With great pleasure.
It was a Tuesday,</font>

185
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">crack of dawn, 5:58 am.</font>

186
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got up, I took my morning deuce,</font>

187
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a breakfast consisting of...</font>

188
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,209
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Green-dale</i></font>

189
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:52,532
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Slop</i></font>

190
00:09:56,501 --> 00:10:00,119
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Greendale isn't a slop pail</i></font>

191
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Almost done.
- Good.</font>

192
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the Dean I'll have a song
that'll make the Devil poop God's pants.</font>

193
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:09,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exciting.</font>

194
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I hear what you got so far?</font>

195
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:17,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll probably open
with something like this.</font>

196
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:20,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a note like that.</font>

197
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">And end with a note like that.</font>

198
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:27,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">The words, I can't tell you.
You know, the rest is really a surprise.</font>

199
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a little worried.
I keep hearing the same two notes,</font>

200
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your sheet music
looks like a Chinese takeout menu.</font>

201
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">A musician sees music in everything.</font>

202
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:40,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it could be...</font>

203
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:42,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Moo shoo pork</i></font>

204
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,614
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Squab with lettuce</i></font>

205
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?
I mean, it just comes out.</font>

206
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You really shouldn't be here.
- What?</font>

207
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are inside a throbbing,
cosmic womb</font>

208
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:56,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">of creativity,
and when this baby starts kicking,</font>

209
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot be responsible
for your sanity.</font>

210
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it sounds funny,
but let me play you out.</font>

211
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing you out now, this song.
Like on stage?</font>

212
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing you out, okay?
Thanks for coming.</font>

213
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye.</font>

214
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then she yelled "Screw you",
Or "Screw education",</font>

215
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">or something like that
and then she stormed out of the room</font>

216
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">in her high-heel boots
like it was tampon time.</font>

217
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you know what I mean.
- Objection. I don't know what he means.</font>

218
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't encourage him.</font>

219
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you have any more questions?
- The defense calls Britta Perry.</font>

220
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are those the high-heel boots
he was talking about?</font>

221
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they comfortable?
They're cute.</font>

222
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you make that crib sheet?</font>

223
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:52,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">She confessed!</font>

224
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">She confessed
to protect her classmates,</font>

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you were threatening
to flunk everyone!</font>

226
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did what?</font>

227
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut your pompous vortex
of overlapping fangs!</font>

228
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">British dentistry is not on trial.</font>

229
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:07,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Pelton, I move this case
be thrown out of...</font>

230
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The pool area!
- It certainly...</font>

231
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:17,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it certainly sounds to me
that this young lady's only crime</font>

232
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:20,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">is being a hero
and wanting to be taller.</font>

233
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:22,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This tribunal is adjourned.
- I cheated!</font>

234
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And we're back.
- Objection. My client did not cheat.</font>

235
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:26,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did.</font>

236
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she did...</font>

237
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?</font>

238
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the real question, isn't it?</font>

239
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:41,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world wasn't the only thing
that changed on September 11th.</font>

240
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:43,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">5-minute recess?</font>

241
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing In the bylaws
about recesses, all right?</font>

242
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wheels of justice here
don't stop just because...</font>

243
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time out!</font>

244
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save the table!</font>

245
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:57,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beginning transmission.</font>

246
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The primary purpose
seems to be male bonding,</font>

247
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">the attitude during conveyance
is apparently of great importance.</font>

248
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:06,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">The humanoid
is approximately 5'10" in height.</font>

249
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:07,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

250
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see you.
How long were you standing there?</font>

251
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You trying to mess with me?
- That's what I was doing. You got me.</font>

252
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was, but I guess I blew it again.</font>

253
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did.</font>

254
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Man, don't turn your back on me.
- It is on like Donkey Kong!</font>

255
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you got a problem with me?</font>

256
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like the fact
that you're walking around here</font>

257
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:42,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you're better than me
in front of my students.</font>

258
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind if we have this conversation
in a room with less balls?</font>

259
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very confident,
I'll say that.</font>

260
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you shouldn't be.</font>

261
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:55,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

262
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have a problem with dishonesty.
- You're on trial for cheating!</font>

263
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:02,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we'll be fine.</font>

264
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just have to go back out there
and make the case you're a good person.</font>

265
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just doing all of this
cause you want to sleep with me.</font>

266
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even want to be my friend.</font>

267
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.
Is that what you thought I meant?</font>

268
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look at me.
- I am.</font>

269
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look how handsome my face is.</font>

270
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:24,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">If all I wanted was sex,
I could get it from plenty of women</font>

271
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">without having to go
through this crap.</font>

272
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here because I like you,</font>

273
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:30,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd be psyched
to be your friend.</font>

274
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to take sex off the table
without doing my due diligence.</font>

275
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I actually believe you.
- Why wouldn't you?</font>

276
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:40,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I guess... same reason that I cheated.</font>

277
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just have more experience
being worthless.</font>

278
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:48,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left that crib sheet on the floor
because I wanted to get caught.</font>

279
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:52,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so used to screwing everything up
I just wanted to get it over with.</font>

280
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we have our defense.</font>

281
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen...</font>

282
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My client is insane.
- What?</font>

283
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, I'm sure you suspected...</font>

284
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Ms. Perry was pretty odd
before the recess.</font>

285
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:14,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you could've heard all the stuff
she just told me in the shower,</font>

286
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would realize
she is all the way out</font>

287
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">of her entire damn mind.</font>

288
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't want to succeed</font>

289
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she doesn't think she can.</font>

290
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:26,602

295
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:38,190

schools make fun of.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone on this campus is nuts.</font>

300
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:51,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me!</font>

301
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,914

your fellow inmate,</font>

can't be at Greendale,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">On the condition that she receives
psychological counseling</font>

309

321
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:07,780

alien hand movements.</font>

if you were actually an alien.</font>
