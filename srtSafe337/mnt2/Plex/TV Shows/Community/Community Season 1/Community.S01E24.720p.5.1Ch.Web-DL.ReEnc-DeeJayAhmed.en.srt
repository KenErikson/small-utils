52
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,260

becoming a lawyer again</font>

56
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:58,204

I can maybe make it until then.</font>

57
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,812

around BFFs.</font>

58
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll build ours around yours.</font>

59
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,752

or not we have a class together, right?</font>

60
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you think that.
Obvious from your name your parents smoked pot.</font>

61
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,114

66
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,407

Where did you learn to count questions?</font>

79

you need a fake degree?</font>

83
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you say "keytar"</font>

84
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">or did you just pronounce guitar
like a hillbilly?</font>

85
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,629

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Get with the times, man.</font>

87

92

<font color="#FFFFFF">I faked my way into a job as a Spanish

<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I know you could be a plumber.
I'm not gonna be, okay?</font>

294
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be sophisticated
and have no job,</font>

295
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a job that looks from a distance
like I do nothing.</font>

296
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, you know what
the best part of my day is?</font>

298
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten seconds from the time I sit in
Spanish to the time I look at your desk.</font>

299
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:57,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I think maybe I'll
look and he won't be there.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">[###]</font>

301
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between our studying for 12 hours,
and Pierce being asleep for 11,</font>

302
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we may actually
stand a chance.</font>

303
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">My horoscope
predicted suffering.</font>

304
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, that's good.
Horoscopes are the devil trying to trick us.</font>

305
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.
Oh.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">[###]</font>

307
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. That make you happy?
Why aren't you at your desk?</font>

308
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't wanna sit near you
because you're a bad friend.</font>

00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said the best part of his day
is when he thinks I won't be there.</font>

310
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what a terrible thing to say.
It's from a movie.</font>

311
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the movie it's from
is terrible.</font>

312
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Annie?</font>

313
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I sent her a text,
but she hasn't responded yet.</font>

314
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, what did I tell you?
Don't play into her ploy for attention.</font>

315
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it say?</font>

316
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says she's fine
and this isn't a ploy for attention.</font>

317
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's sorry. She does need to grow up,
starting by making things right with Chang.</font>

318
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

319
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
He'll kill her.</font>

320
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares about a stupid exam?</font>

321
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a study group.</font>

322
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Annie's our friend.</font>

323
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm friends with Hannah too.</font>

324
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole class is.</font>

325
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can't have
an exam without a class.</font>

326
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, guys?</font>

327
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">We love Hannah.</font>

328
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,223
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We love Hannah.</i></font>

329
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,868
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We love Hannah.
We love Hannah.</i></font>

330
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

331
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

332
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
The devil told the truth.</font>

333
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Whoa.</font>

334
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger, what the hell?
What was that screaming?</font>

335
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was showing Annie
the magic of electronic sampling.</font>

336
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought
you were murdering her.</font>

337
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie getting me fired was the best
thing that ever happened to me.</font>

338
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's helping me
re-plan my life.</font>

339
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a real mind
for stuff like this.</font>

340
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna find Ben a job so he
can stay at Greendale as a student</font>

341
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">and work on his teaching degree.
And music classes, you know?</font>

342
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe get the band back together,
huh?</font>

343
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Listen to that.</font>

344
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Music lessons
would be great for you.</font>

345
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks, Britta.</font>

346
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go pass that test.
Heh, heh, heh.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">[###]</font>

348
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was kind of easy, right?</font>

349
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I think I might have passed.</font>

350
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:59,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I can never forgive myself
for what I did.</font>

351
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I treated you like
a child for having feelings.</font>

352
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe because that's, you know,
when I stopped having them.</font>

353
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you shouldn't.</font>

354
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to be a kid
to admit that you like people.</font>

355
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't have to dress
like this to grow up.</font>

356
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a travel agent.</font>

357
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like it?</font>

358
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going
for more of a professor thing.</font>

359
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why?</font>

360
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Nothing.</font>

361
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I got half of it, which
got me through the half I didn't.</font>

362
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,532
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like the first season of The Wire.
Exactly the...</i></font>

363
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, hell, I can't stay mad at you.</font>

364
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I nailed it.
Oh, me too.</font>

365
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm feeling pretty confident.
I think we're gonna make it.</font>

366
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, we should plan
for the worst-case scenario.</font>

367
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if we do all pass,</font>

368
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">that means next year,
we won't have a class together.</font>

369
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're gonna need a backup.</font>

370
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anthropology? Anthropology?
Anthropology?</font>

371
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anthropology?
Heh, heh, heh.</font>

372
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anthropology.
Anthropology.</font>

373

half-hearted mislead, 80.</font>

extra easy?</font>

391
