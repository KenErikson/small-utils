a partially clothed animal</font>

00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? The mayor? Stop doing that.
I'm trying to help.</font>

296
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not doing this right.
Well, maybe you should do it.</font>

297
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sick and tired
of making excuses for you two.</font>

298
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an embarrassment
to the department.</font>

299
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're off the case and off the force.
Your badges, your windbreakers now.</font>

300
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. I ain't got all day.</font>

301
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agitating my sciatica.</font>

302
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm too old for this.
Now get out of my sight.</font>

303
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you were badasses, huh?</font>

304
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real badasses work together.</font>

305
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

306
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I see is a housewife
and girl scout.</font>

307
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Abed.</font>

308
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, get out.</font>

309
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't even think about
getting near this case. Uh-uh.</font>

310
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty harsh.</font>

311
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry,
that's what they needed.</font>

312
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">[###]</font>

313
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was embarrassing.
I know.</font>

314
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">That African-American police chief
character Abed was playing was right.</font>

315
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have worked as a team.</font>

316
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about you,
I don't need a badge to finish this.</font>

317
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we nail Winger to the wall.</font>

318
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together?
Together.</font>

319
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you spell "testicles"?</font>

320
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice frame job, Britta-dict Arnold.</font>

321
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, colonial burn.</font>

322
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Jeff, where's that
trademark gift for levity?</font>

323
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well, look who we found.</font>

324
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:40,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, how foolish of me to hide in
my regularly scheduled study group.</font>

325
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, ahem, let's just do this
the easy way. Confess.</font>

326
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's the one
who threw that body out the window.</font>

327
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can prove it.
How?</font>

328
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta was going to put a frog wearing
a sombrero on Chang's desk</font>

329
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">because that's the kind of thing
she thinks is funny.</font>

330
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you, Britta?
No.</font>

331
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why is there a photo
on your Facebook page</font>

332
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a cat wearing a necktie?</font>

333
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pfft. This is my cat.</font>

334
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the tie makes him?</font>

335
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Formal.</font>

336
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">This investigation
is going nowhere.</font>

337
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need a psychic.</font>

338
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

339
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">This process may alarm you.</font>

340
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Gay, gay, gay. So gay.</font>

341
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh-oh. Dark nightclub. Aah, aah.</font>

342
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throbbing music.</font>

343
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men's room... Men's room stall.</font>

344
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Penis. Two penises.</font>

345
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. So gay. He's so gay.</font>

346
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.
What?</font>

347
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down. We'll take it from here.
Uhn.</font>

348
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, where were you last night?
At a bar.</font>

349
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Called it.
Who can confirm that?</font>

350
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mama?
What?</font>

351
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">While I'm...
Oh!</font>

352
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

353
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, Annie?</font>

354
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name's not Annie, it's Psycho.
If I were you, I'd tell her what she wants to hear.</font>

355
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, because if I have
to hand you off to Shirley,</font>

356
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna enter
a kitchen of pain.</font>

357
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhn!
Guys, stop it.</font>

358
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it. I did it.</font>

359
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I framed Jeff.</font>

360
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Jeff.</font>

361
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?
Because I'm a buzz kill, that's why.</font>

362
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's who I am.
That's my role.</font>

363
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:26,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, you create fun,
and I destroy it.</font>

364
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course a silly little joke ends
with a dead body on the lawn.</font>

365
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have known that
but I wanted to do it anyway.</font>

366
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to be like you.
I wanted to be funny.</font>

367
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock, knock.
Who's there? Cancer.</font>

368
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:42,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good, come on in.
I thought it was Britta.</font>

369
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

370
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I actually wanna be taken
more seriously.</font>

371
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only reason I slammed
Jeff's head against the table</font>

372
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">was because I wanted to feel
like an adult.</font>

373
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Shirley.</font>

374
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I wanted to feel younger
like Annie.</font>

375
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that I'm really old because people
don't know how young I really am. See?</font>

376
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing it again.
I hate that I obsess about my age.</font>

377
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know.</font>

378
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I was really magic. Heh.</font>

379
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know you're not?
Yeah.</font>

380
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah. Somebody must have sent
these robes by accident.</font>

381
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only pretended I was level six
to impress you guys.</font>

382
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got held back.</font>

383
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even deserve
this Buddhist meteor wand.</font>

384
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

385
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a meteor. It's a cookie wand.</font>

386
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and Jeff made it</font>

387
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it made you look
like the Cookie Crisp wizard.</font>

388
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is not even a reference I get
because the Cookie Crisp mascot</font>

389
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">wasn't a wizard when I was a kid,
it was a burglar.</font>

390
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:51,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just pretended like I knew because
I wanted Jeff to think I was smart.</font>

391
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. I did it again.</font>

392
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed the buzz.</font>

393
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, um...</font>

394
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe...</font>

395
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe "buzz kill"
is a bad choice of words.</font>

396
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a good choice of words?</font>

397
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. L... I, um... I...</font>

398
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're... You're like the dark cloud
that unites us.</font>

399
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the... The anti-Winger.</font>

400
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like... You're...
You're the heart of this group.</font>

401
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Look, um, I don't have a real
handle on all this mushy stuff.</font>

402
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:34,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">If... If I did,
then we wouldn't need you.</font>

403
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, get over here.</font>

404
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
Yeah.</font>

405
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's never let Jeff divide us again.</font>

406
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed.</font>

407
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you and I the only sane...?
Shh.</font>

408
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just watch. It's beautiful.</font>

409
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, do you want a bite of my wand?
I do.</font>

410
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really appreciate
you doing this.</font>

411
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.
And three, two, one.</font>

412
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed in the morning ♪</font>

413
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're back.
Look who's here, Jeff Winger.</font>

414
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, how do you stay so fit?</font>

415
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Diet, exercise, genetics.</font>

416
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, sure.
Okay. So it seems we have a clip.</font>

417
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna set up for us?</font>

418
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'd like to but I don't know
what you're talking about.</font>

419
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll just roll it.</font>

420
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. My name's Jeff Winger.</font>

421
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. I'm Jeff Winger. I'm so tall.</font>

422
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">This watch is expensive.
Muscles are everywhere.</font>

423
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was funny.</font>

424
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?
Where are the cameras?</font>

425
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not filming this.
No. Who'd wanna watch this?</font>

426
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, it's 6 a.m. Jeez.</font>

427
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna have him back.</font>

428
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed in the morn... ♪</font>

429
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>
