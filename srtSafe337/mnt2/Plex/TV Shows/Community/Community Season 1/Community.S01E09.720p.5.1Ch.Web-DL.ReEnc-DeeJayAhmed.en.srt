00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then the guy says
to the housekeeper:</font>

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Make sure she's dead."
Stop me if you've heard this before.</font>

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would've been nice
27 minutes ago.</font>

4
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:11,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">The housekeeper says to the guy,
"We don't have a pool."</font>

5
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:14,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the guy says...</font>

6
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,052
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Good morning, Greendale.</i></font>

7
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:18,553
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just a reminder,
our debate team will bring home</i></font>

8
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>the championship tomorrow
versus City College.</i></font>

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,822
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Go, Human Beings.</i></font>

10
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, now I gotta start
the whole joke over again.</font>

11
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so this...
No! I've got one for you.</font>

12
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:31,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">A doddering old fool
walks into a bar,</font>

13
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:35,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">tells a stupid joke, and I crush his
windpipe with my three-ringed binder.</font>

14
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.
Britta's trying to give up cigarettes.</font>

15
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:40,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell them my business.</font>

16
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:44,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll slap that look
off your pointy face.</font>

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I'm saying this because I care
about you and you're my friend.</font>

18
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to start smoking again.</font>

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really think you should.</font>

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lose weight and your skin
looks great when you smoke.</font>

21
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I appreciate your support,
but I've got to quit.</font>

22
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you thought
about hypnotherapy?</font>

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a hypnotherapist.
Ten-to-one says it's him.</font>

24
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:06,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Pierce Hawthorne.
And I'm very effective.</font>

25
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:10,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you help me block out people's
voices I find extremely annoying?</font>

26

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, she's right there.</font>

27
00:01:12,645 --> 00:01:14,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce,</font>

28
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would be grateful for your help.</font>

29
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would? Super. I'll set it up.</font>

30
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I feel bad for him.</font>

31
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, I just yelled at him.</font>

32
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You yelled at me too.
Oh.</font>

33
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:25,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I hurt your feelings,
pointy face?</font>

34
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:27,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Wow.</font>

35
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen
the film department's website?</font>

36
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

37
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:35,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of Abed's films are about us.
What?</font>

38
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out.</font>

39
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,060
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What else is new?</i></font>

40
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:41,364
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff.</i></font>

41
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:42,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hola.</font>

42
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:45,472
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff, stop being so relaxed.
We need to talk to you about...</i></font>

43
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:49,136
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're living out of your car. Why on
earth are you living out of your car?</i></font>

44
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:51,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people look just like us.
That's eerie.</font>

45
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:54,915
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fine, it's true.
I'm living out of my car.</i></font>

46
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:56,481
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I don't want anyone's help.</i></font>

47
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had almost that
exact conversation last week.</font>

48
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but Abed posted
this video two weeks ago.</font>

49
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">That boy is a soothsayer.</font>

50
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is wrinkling my brain.
This is wrinkling my brain.</i></font>

51
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's wrinkling my brain.</font>

52
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,031
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get a load of these wrinkles.</i></font>

53
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:18,402
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Heh, heh. Who's that old guy?
Hi. I'm Pierce Hawthorne.</i></font>

54
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.
Oh. Mr. Winger. Hold on.</font>

56
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you to hear my announcement?
I hang on every word.</font>

57
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume that's sarcasm.
Correct.</font>

58
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't hear?
I'm barely listening now.</font>

59
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

60
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:40,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">My debate partner dropped out.
We need you for the championship.</font>

61
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, as debate coach,
I'm offering you an opportunity</font>

62
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">to spend a night
drinking from the cup of life</font>

63
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">rather than romancing your nether
regions in front of the E! Channel.</font>

64
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Jeff, who better than
a former lawyer to really stick it</font>

65
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:56,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">to those City College snobs
and their star debater, Simmons?</font>

66
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Pass.</font>

67
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:00,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, no, no, no. Wait.</font>

68
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, no, no, no. Look.</font>

69
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, jerk wad.</font>

70
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, that got heated.</font>

71
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale needs a win.</font>

72
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:10,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best compliment
our sports program gets</font>

73
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:12,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that our basketball team
is really gay.</font>

74
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's it gonna take?</font>

75
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">A plum parking space? Free meals?</font>

76
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">A night of companionship,
if you know what I mean?</font>

77
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:25,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it for the parking space.</font>

78
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you promise not to
tell me what you mean.</font>

79
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Yeah.</font>

80
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:33,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, thank you.
I really appreciate you helping me out.</font>

81
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I appreciate the opportunity.</font>

82
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:38,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, sometimes I think
people don't take me seriously.</font>

83
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:39,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna do?</font>

84
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wave a pocket watch
in front of my face</font>

85
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell me
I'm getting very sleepy.</font>

86
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just checking the time.</font>

87
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now close your eyes
and keep them closed at all times.</font>

88
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:55,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">And listen to the soothing
sound of my voice.</font>

89
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only word that
will bring you out is</font>

90
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">"gorilla."</font>

91
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now, focus on the rhythm
of your own breathing.</font>

92
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you feel the desire
to light up a cigarette</font>

93
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will associate these urges with
things in your life that disgust you.</font>

94

97
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I think I really hurt myself.</font>

98
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody help me.</font>

99
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Britta, wake up.</font>

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did I put you under so well?</font>

101
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn my talents. Aah!</font>

102
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The topic for the debate is,
"Are people inherently good or evil?"</font>

103
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:38,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">When do you want to
get together to strategize?</font>

104
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I was a lawyer.</font>

105
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:41,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a debater for money.</font>

106
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I can handle this.</font>

107
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how was hypnotherapy?</font>

108
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">He fell down while I laid there to make
him feel like a good hypnotherapist.</font>

109
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize this will never end.
It's already done.</font>

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just wants one more session.</font>

112
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:00,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Abed?
I need to talk to him about his films.</font>

113
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">That boy is flat-out prescient.
He can read our minds.</font>

114
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:08,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. You watched my movies.</font>

115
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:10,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a witch.
Get him.</font>

116
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:12,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a witch.
I'm a student of human character.</font>

117
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:15,549

I can predict your behavior.</font>

118

Christian, generous person.</font>

Oh, that's nice.</font>

120
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:24,259

122
00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:29,462

Yeah.</font>

a bald, bespectacled man</font>

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">held the door
for a man in a wheelchair.</font>

149
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:13,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man is good.</font>

150
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Heh, heh. I hate this guy.</font>

151
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:19,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the end of this debate</font>

152
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:23,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will prove with facts and data</font>

153
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">that man is inherently good.</font>

154
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:33,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little trick for achieving
the proper competitive mind set.</font>

155
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always envision my opponent</font>

156
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:37,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">having aggressive sex
with my mother.</font>

157
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:49,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">This feels so formal.</font>

158
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just talk.</font>

159
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are evil. They can't help it.</font>

160
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:58,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't catch your name.</font>

161
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:00,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Jean.
Take Jean here.</font>

162
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:04,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">She spent a lot of time this morning
making herself look so lovely.</font>

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, how many people bothered
to tell you how great you look today?</font>

164
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">None.
Man is evil.</font>

165
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:14,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you just said how great I looked.</font>

166
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my own selfish purposes.</font>

167
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:20,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fact is, as hot as you look</font>

168
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:24,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it is quite hot,
I wouldn't have said anything.</font>

169
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I talk about
people being evil,</font>

170
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could cite quotes,
or dig up statistics,</font>

171
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:31,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">but those are
just words and numbers.</font>

172
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:35,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we could have
a little more fun</font>

173
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:39,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I express myself in song.</font>

174
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,491

175
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Evil woman ♪♪</font>

176
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my time, everybody.</font>

177
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you very much. Yeah.</font>

178
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the end of round one.</font>

179
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">City College, 50.</font>

180
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:04,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale, eight.</font>

181
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got eight?</font>

182
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only got eight?
She got eight.</font>

185
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">All sizzle, no steak.</font>

186
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care, dude.
I'm doing this for a parking space.</font>

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, boys. Come on, let's go.</font>

188
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:32,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna see some hustlers
out there. Let's go.</font>

189
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:34,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">By Zeus.
What sort of jackassery is this?</font>

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in the middle of a debate.</font>

191
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We reserved the gym
for practice so...</font>

192
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:41,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, they reserved it.</font>

193
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, they got us by the short ones.</font>

194
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:46,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">The debate is suspended
until tomorrow.</font>

195
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hopefully, by then we can
get our act together.</font>

196
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:54,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great try, Bruce. Great try.</font>

197
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">When are we getting
together to prepare for tomorrow?</font>

198
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never. Because it's stupid
and I don't care.</font>

199
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bite me.</font>

200
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:08,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Simmons is right.
You really are all sizzle and no steak.</font>

201
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably couldn't beat him.
What do you mean, I can't beat him?</font>

202
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are going to study harder
and beat City College tomorrow.</font>

203
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:16,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
No.</font>

don't bother you, but they do.</font>

I was a lawyer. I wore suits.</font>

218
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,288

You're a fool.</font>

You're knee-deep in it, brother.</font>

249
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,579

261
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:14,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

262
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful. Abed thinks
you two are going to kiss.</font>

263
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:20,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha! Ridiculous.</font>

264
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:22,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Us kissing.</font>

265
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is ridiculous.
Totally.</font>

266
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get back to work.
Yes.</font>

267
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:36,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. The...
People are inherently evil.</font>

268
00:13:36,988 --> 00:13:39,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we can use this Hobbes quote.</font>

269
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Man is a collection
of base, animal urges."</font>

270
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">To act on them
and experience sinful pleasure</font>

271
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:50,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">"would be morally no different
than taking a breath."</font>

272
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's poignant, right?
Yeah.</font>

273
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
maybe we should study alone.</font>

274
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Uh-huh.
Separately.</font>

275
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way we can be more
reproductive... Productive.</font>

276
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:04,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.
Bye.</font>

277
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you forgot your phone.
Oh, I can get another one.</font>

278
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next time you
even see a cigarette,</font>

279
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will think of things
that disgust you.</font>

280
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:28,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">And while you're under so deep,</font>

281
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll find yourself attracted
to slightly older men.</font>

282
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:38,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps some barrel-chested stud
with just enough, heh, tummy to love.</font>

283
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:40,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll want to buy him dinner.</font>

284
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:42,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then go back to his hot tub.</font>

285
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:46,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll invite one of your friends
to join us for a three-way.</font>

286
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:50,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe someone with low self-esteem

287
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to hell, you disgusting pig.</font>

288
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:54,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">A-ha!</font>

289
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I was awake the whole time.
I was faking it.</font>

290
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I saw you.</font>

291
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think I am? Some joke?
No.</font>

292
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:05,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was trying to make you
feel better about yourself.</font>

293
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,937
