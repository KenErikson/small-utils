1
00:00:01,931 --> 00:00:04,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">A small, fading remnant of a star.</font>

2
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:07,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">A white dwarf.
That's right.</font>

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:08,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used a memory technique.</font>

4
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:12,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dwarves hate being called midgets,
and midgets are small.</font>

5
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

6
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:16,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what does a star turn into
after it collapses?</font>

7
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:18,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">A movie of the week.</font>

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">A black hole.
Right.</font>

9
00:00:19,838 --> 00:00:22,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, you could be an astronomer.</font>

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as I'm concerned, there's only
one black hole worth studying.</font>

11
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called Sagittarius A.</font>

12
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's located in the center of our galaxy
and it has the density of 40 suns.</font>

13
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like my wiener.
Ha-ha.</font>

14
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:39,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said "wiener." That's funny.</font>

15
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce and Troy didn't get along at first but
now they're bonding through mutual adolescence.</font>

16
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, fart head.
Will you shut up, poo-poo head?</font>

17
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:48,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, everybody. Ha-ha.
Well, look at this group.</font>

18
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:52,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having some kind of meeting and
being so diverse. There is just...</font>

19
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:55,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, there is just one
of every kind of you, isn't there?</font>

20
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we are missing a pipsqueak
but we don't want one, so beat it.</font>

21
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Pierce, that's the dean.</font>

22
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kidding?</font>

23
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:04,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Just my luck.</font>

24
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. Don't let me interrupt.</font>

25
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, I just roll around campus
like a little football.</font>

26
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe this.</font>

27
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:14,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here I am in a random conversation
about football,</font>

28
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm talking to Troy Barnes, star
quarterback from Riverside High. Whoa. Heh.</font>

29
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:22,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, did you know Greendale
has a football team?</font>

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know they had a football?</font>

31
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:25,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Heh. Good. That's very funny.</font>

32
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I was so sorry to hear about your
injury, but now that you have recovered,</font>

33
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">we would love for you to play
for the Human Beings.</font>

34
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:34,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">The team's name is
the Human Beings?</font>

35
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. My idea.</font>

36
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:39,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the Greendale Grizzlies
but I thought that, um...</font>

37
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, a lot of these students
have been called animals their whole lives.</font>

38
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, I don't
know what to do about the mascot.</font>

39
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:47,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I could help with that,
Your Honor.</font>

40
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a wealth of experience
in image management,</font>

41
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:52,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">icon development,
and Y2K preparedness.</font>

42
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you?
Troy isn't interested</font>

43
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">in football anymore.
Getting injured in that keg stand</font>

44
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the best thing
that ever happened to him.</font>

45
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Yoko Ono much?</font>

46
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha.
Bros before ho's, Troy.</font>

47
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. Listen, man, no offense,</font>

48
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was the best
and I finished on top.</font>

49
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't play for this school
with a 10-foot pole.</font>

50
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:19,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I'm sure Troy will sign up
for football,</font>

51
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">if and when some accident damages
the part of his brain that feels pride.</font>

52
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:26,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until then, would you excuse us?
All right.</font>

53
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, if you change your mind,
the field is always open.</font>

54
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:32,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, figuratively speaking. You know.
Wednesdays and Sundays</font>

55
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:36,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's used as parking overflow
for the megachurch. Okay. Heh.</font>

56
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:40,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let's meet the minimum requirements
for a language credit, shall we?</font>

57
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:43,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but I need to go
to the bathroom first. Uh, Britta?</font>

58
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I don't have to go.</font>

59
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go with you.</font>

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? She's offended?</font>

61
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls go in groups.</font>

62
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you learn nothing
from standup comedy in the '90s?</font>

63
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm familiar with the concept,
I just... Uh...</font>

64
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:02,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. If it's important to Shirley,
I'll go next time.</font>

65
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm willing to try some more
mainstream feminine stuff.</font>

66
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:08,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you should know nothing says,
"I'm a woman"</font>

67
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">like doing it with me.</font>

68
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing says, "I'm a pig," like you.</font>

69
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will they or won't they?
Sexual tension.</font>

70
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:18,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed. It makes the group
uncomfortable when you talk</font>

71
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">like we're characters in a show
you're watching.</font>

72
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's sort of my gimmick.</font>

73
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we did lean on that pretty hard
last week.</font>

74
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can lay low for an episode.</font>

75
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you made the right
call on the football team, Troy?</font>

76
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like
they won something once.</font>

77
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:44,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Most Valued Customer,
Henderson Trophy Cases."</font>

78
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:48,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should still study
a little more astronomy later, right?</font>

79
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe over some Milky Ways
or some Mars bars.</font>

80
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or pancakes.</font>

81
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:58,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm Jeff and I'm a
student at Greendale"?</font>

82
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not good.</font>

83
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wood undergoes rapid oxidation</font>

84
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:06,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it reacts
spontaneously to...</font>

85
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:09,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, guys. Seriously.
We've talked about this.</font>

86
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you have got to turn off
your cell ph...</font>

87
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's mine. My bad.</font>

88
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to the bathroom.
Would you like to come with me?</font>

89
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes. Yes, I would.</font>

90
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

91
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:26,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, what's it called?
Antoni...? Hold on.</font>

92
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody have a pen? A pen?</font>

93
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one has a pen.</font>

94
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you not bring a pen
to class?</font>

95
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot. No, you're not an idiot.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

96
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had my blinker on about five
minutes and this no-good,</font>

97
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">"clearly bald but trying to hide it
with a bandana" loser swooped right in.</font>

98
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't believe it.
Maybe he didn't see you.</font>

99
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:46,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saw me.
Maybe he had his blinker on too.</font>

100
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

101
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:51,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you got any family, Britta?
Yeah. Whatever.</font>

102
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mom might visit this weekend.
She and I are gonna get makeovers at that spa...</font>

103
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makeovers. They sure have us
programmed right.</font>

104
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:04,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a female pleasure unit.
I require a new coat of paint.</font>

105
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just something
I thought might be fun.</font>

106
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's
something I think might be fun.</font>

107
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's find out the number of makeup
companies that are owned by women.</font>

108
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll save you the trouble. It's zero.</font>

109
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you're saying,
"Britta, aren't you a hypocrite?</font>

110
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:20,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're plastered with glitter and goo
from head to toe like the rest of us."</font>

111
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I also pay income tax
and pull over for cops.</font>

112
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:24,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that doesn't mean I support
a country that oppresses citizens,</font>

113
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:27,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">restricts voting rights...</font>

114
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for offering to help design
the new mascot.</font>

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh, have been a little stumped.
Heh. That's no problem.</font>

116
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, I took the liberty of
thumbnailing a Human Being prototype,</font>

117
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:41,469
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>uh, which I modeled
after Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.</i></font>

118
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. You're offering it but...
The penis is a little small, I think.</font>

119
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:47,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. It looks a lot like you.
Okay.</font>

120
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, here's the thing.</font>

121
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we are the Human Beings,
you know,</font>

122
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:54,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we have a mascot
that's just a white guy,</font>

123
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:56,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">what message are we sending?</font>

124
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:59,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our symbol needs to reflect
the diversity of our school</font>

125
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our species.
So, black?</font>

126
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because we're not the
Greendale Blacks, Mr. Hawthorne,</font>

127
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the Greendale Asians,
or any other creed.</font>

128
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are
the Greendale Human Beings.</font>

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Sorry to disturb you guys.</font>

130
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:17,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are clearly looking at a clearly naked
drawing of Pierce doing jumping jacks.</font>

131
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, a quick download, please?
Uh... Absolutely.</font>

132
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:23,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
Okay. Fill me in later.</font>

133
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa-oh.</font>

134
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Good, a pencil.</font>

135
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all, I'm flattered.</font>

136
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:34,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well,
you're a very photogenic man.</font>

137
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that real bed head, or do you
put something in there? Can I?</font>

138
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. It's crispy.
I was thinking about</font>

139
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">the four disembodied heads
and I thought,</font>

140
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the heart?
Where's the soul?</font>

141
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:45,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the different poster design?</font>

142
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I did think those
were less than personable.</font>

143
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why
I went with the full bodies</font>

144
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">in these mailers we have going out.
Ta-ta-ta.</font>

145
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mailers?
I didn't give permission for this.</font>

146
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, did you not read
the release agreement</font>

147
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:02,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the back of your registration form?
Heh-heh-heh.</font>

148
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to see why someone
used to be a lawyer. Ha-ha-ha.</font>

149
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:08,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if someone from the outside
were to find...</font>

150
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if someone from the outside
were to find out</font>

151
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:13,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I am a student
at a community college,</font>

152
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:16,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">that could have a negative impact
on my future career.</font>

153
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

154
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodness.
Look what we have stumbled onto.</font>

155
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:24,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">An opportunity to help
each other out.</font>

156
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:26,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose I wouldn't need
this promotional campaign</font>

157
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I could announce to the press that
Troy Barnes is playing football here.</font>

158
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's been pretty clear
about declining that offer.</font>

159
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think if you said jump,
he'd say, "How high?"</font>

160
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:38,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you said stop,
he'd say "Hammer time."</font>

161
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You starting to get what I mean?
Hmm?</font>

162
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I need another example.</font>

163
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I didn't realize before,</font>

164
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:48,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we should send those out
to local businesses.</font>

165
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:55,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Law firms, lawyer companies,</font>

166
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:59,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">legal gatherings.</font>

167
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trying to blackmail me?
I think so.</font>

168
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:07,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, I present to you
the Greendale Human Being.</font>

169
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a falcon with a gun.</font>

170
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's a falcon with an erection.</font>

171
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi, Abed.</font>

172
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:23,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.
Bye. He's just laying low.</font>

173
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you going to the bathroom?
Uh... Yes.</font>

174
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:29,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go with you.
You know what? I'm good.</font>

175
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">She probably just, you know,
had to go number two.</font>

176
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, what's the closest planet
to Earth?</font>

177
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Planet Hollywood?
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

178
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:46,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the right answer but
it shows how fun astronomy can be.</font>

179
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Troy,
can I talk to you for a sec?</font>

180
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're studying, so Troy's busy.</font>

181
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the galaxy's
not going anywhere.</font>

182
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:54,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring him back.</font>

183
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever miss being
a quarterback, Troy?</font>

184
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss being the best
at something.</font>

185
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss having a coach.</font>

186
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss knowing what to think.</font>

187
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still know what to think, Troy.
Oh, good.</font>

188
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:10,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">For instance, after the dean
talked to you about football,</font>

189
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:12,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and I were thinking
the same thing.</font>

190
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:13,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dude looks like Moby.</font>

191
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were thinking, what if
Troy did play for Greendale?</font>

192
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:19,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be surprised at how many of
your favorite football players</font>

193
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">got started at community college.</font>

194
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Name one.</font>

195
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:25,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's your favorite player?
Me. Whoa.</font>

196
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:30,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you and I should go check out
the Greendale Thunderdome.</font>

197
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:40,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dome arrives later.
It comes with thunder.</font>

198
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you
a little secret about me, Troy.</font>

199
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, on my way to school,</font>

200
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drive through downtown,
past the courthouse,</font>

201
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">just to get a glimpse of the world
that I once ruled.</font>

202
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just wanna jump out of my car,
run up the steps,</font>

203
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">and exploit the legal system
for profit.</font>

204
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't.
I'm locked out of my old kingdom.</font>

205
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not.
You see what I'm saying?</font>

206
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:05,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying I could be a lawyer.
I'm saying you're a football player.</font>

207
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in your blood.
That's racist.</font>

208
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:08,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your soul.
That's racist.</font>

209
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:09,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your eyes?
That's gay?</font>

210
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's homophobic.
That's black.</font>

211
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's racist.
Damn.</font>

212
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you played, you were a god.</font>

213
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're not playing
and you're not.</font>

214
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd tell you to do the math,
but math isn't important.</font>

215
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing
that's important is this.</font>

216
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,753
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, but Annie said...
Annie said that Benjamin Button</i></font>

217
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:28,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">was compelling. Look, she's a smart
girl but sometimes she's just wrong.</font>

218
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eighty-five, go long.</font>

219
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a drug, isn't it?</font>

220
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel it, Troy. Throw it.</font>

221
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:38,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">The scoreboard lights up.
There will be a scoreboard there.</font>

222
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's complete. Nice catch.</font>

223
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:44,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls, the glory,
the scouts, the career.</font>

224
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">It starts when you join this team.</font>

225
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that linebacker
a pregnant woman?</font>

226
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you can meet them later,</font>

227
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this decision has to be yours,
T-Bone.</font>

228
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this decision has to be yes.</font>

229
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know my nickname
was T-Bone?</font>

230
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:01,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're a football player
and your name begins with T.</font>

231
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:07,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name begins with T.</font>

232
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?</font>

233
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you finished?</font>

234
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I have to go, but apparently,
I failed yesterday's tryouts</font>

235
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the position
of bathroom companion.</font>

236
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Britta, I wasn't trying
to hurt your feelings.</font>

237
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. You didn't hurt
my feelings, Shirley.</font>

238
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:28,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to go to the bathroom
with other people.</font>

239
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:30,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just trying to throw you a bone
because I like you.</font>

240
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. You can keep that bone.</font>

241
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listening to a story about a stranger pissing
me off and taking the stranger's side?</font>

242
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:38,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you can't talk
about your own business</font>

243
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you insinuate
my mama's a robot</font>

244
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she and I want makeovers.
That is the ladies room, Britta.</font>

245
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">A place where ladies go to share,
listen, support each other,</font>

246
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">and discretely eliminate waste.</font>

247
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I like you too.
I even like that you're a little hard,</font>

248
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you can't learn
to be soft in there,</font>

249
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to pee alone.</font>

250
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:01,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've peed alone my whole life.</font>

251
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women have always hated me.</font>

252
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know how it started.</font>

253
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:10,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was when I got boobs
before everybody...</font>

254
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shhh.</font>

255
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:14,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not out here.</font>

256
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,092

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're right.
That beige is a little light.</font>

287
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... Wow.</font>

288
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

289
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are developing
the perfect mascot.</font>

290
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:47,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stereotypical identifiers
from any race or gender.</font>

291
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:50,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Jeff, this is a chart of the
features we're staying away from.</font>

292
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:54,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pan-Asian eye folds, uh,
Irish chins, women's breasts.</font>

293
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that Seal?
Oh, that is our human color wheel.</font>

294
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes from Seal to Seal's teeth.
What do you think?</font>

295
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:05,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think not being racist
is the new racism.</font>

296
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:07,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to the prototype?</font>

297
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:09,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. I left the nose in the kiln.
Oh.</font>

298
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:14,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Troy is gonna play football.
Yes.</font>

299
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means
I'll be getting rid of these.</font>

300
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, uh, I won't mail these out
but they are staying with me</font>

301
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:22,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">until the press announces
that Troy is a part of the team.</font>

302
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want him at that pep rally tonight.
Reporters are gonna be there.</font>

303
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna unveil
the new mascot</font>

304
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">and things are finally
going to start turning around.</font>

305
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and my ex-therapist
is gonna think twice</font>

306
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he makes fun of my job!</font>

307
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is. Still hot.
Ooh. Ow.</font>

308
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Dean, I'm gonna get some
more coffee. You want anything?</font>

309
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:45,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, uh, a Desmond Tutu with just enough
cream to make it a Lou Diamond Phillips.</font>

310
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:47,345
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>La Bamba. Got it.</i></font>

311
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha!</font>

312
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been following you.</font>

313
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much did the dean pay you
to make Troy play football?</font>

314
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not having a conversation with
someone who emerges from a bush.</font>

315
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:03,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm right?
No.</font>

316
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm not in a commercial
for breakfast cereal.</font>

317
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the dean has pictures of me,
okay?</font>

318
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horrible pictures of me.</font>

319
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attending his school.</font>

320
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:17,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for that, you've convinced Troy to flush
his life down football's toilet again?</font>

321
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's right. You are the most
selfish person alive.</font>

322
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:23,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all that is gonna end right now.
I'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.</font>

323
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:27,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should tell him
you're hopelessly in love with him.</font>

324
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">High school must have been tough,
huh?</font>

325
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waiting for a superstar
to notice you.</font>

326
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:36,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here, here, he's all alone
and he needs so much help.</font>

327
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you enroll in all his classes or were
you worried that might freak him out?</font>

328
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:43,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">The important thing is
that you are there for him.</font>

329
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">The important thing is that you
are the only one there for him.</font>

330
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't really care
what he wants,</font>

331
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:51,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">just as long as you don't have
to share him with the world.</font>

332
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:54,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, really,
you are just as selfish as I am.</font>

333
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:57,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just not as good at it yet.</font>

334
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

335
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never be as good as you.</font>

336
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably because I actually care.</font>

337
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Profound
but technically meaningless.</font>

338
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't bother trying that thing
women do where they walk away</font>

339
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:15,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make the guy feel like crap,
because it won't happen.</font>

340
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

341
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

342
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, will you
please come to the bathroom with me?</font>

343
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Shirley?
Shirley's not coming.</font>

344
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:42,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, uh, I'm here to listen, girl.</font>

345
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do we inflict so much pain
on ourselves for men?</font>

346
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't</font>

347
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">know, sweetie.</font>

348
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:57,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's because
men make the world go around?</font>

349
00:16:57,847 --> 00:16:59,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kleenex?</font>

350
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:07,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been infatuated with Troy.</font>

351
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:09,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's joining football.</font>

352
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:15,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he'll have his pick of the litter
and I'll never get to be with him.</font>

353
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie, screw him.</font>

354
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are guys out there
that would kill to be with you.</font>

355
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Troy isn't one of them,
that's him failing your standards.</font>

356
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got that?</font>

357
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:29,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. I can't control him.</font>

358
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:35,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I truly cared about him,
I wouldn't want to.</font>

359
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for talking to me, Britta.
It really helped.</font>

360
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously?
Yes.</font>

361
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's my girl?</font>

362
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
I did it. I did it.</font>

363
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:51,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you did.</font>

364
00:17:56,772 --> 00:18:00,139
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Human Beings,
Human Beings, Human Beings.</i></font>

365
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,408
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Human Beings, Human Beings.</i></font>

366
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy. Troy.</font>

367
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:07,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go in there, man.
What?</font>

368
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got the most you were ever going
to get out of football in high school.</font>

369
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">A life of disillusionment
and depression</font>

370
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">begins on the other side
of that door.</font>

371
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, is this your first pep rally
or something?</font>

372
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:22,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me football was the most
important thing in the world.</font>

373
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:24,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, buckle up, Troy
I was exaggerating.</font>

374
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of my gimmick.</font>

375
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:28,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you something.
No, let me tell you something.</font>

376
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that keg flip
that cost me my scholarship?</font>

377
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:32,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

378
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hurt myself on purpose.
What?</font>

379
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:38,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a scout coming
to the final game at Riverside</font>

380
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I couldn't take the pressure.
So I took the easy way out.</font>

381
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you showed me that field,</font>

382
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw there was nothing
to worry about here.</font>

383
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could just play football
for the fun of it.</font>

384
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:49,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
have you seen these guys?</font>

385
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:52,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is nowhere to go but up.
Dude, we have feelings.</font>

386
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:56,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about you,
but I know I ended up here</font>

387
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:59,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">because things
weren't that great out there.</font>

388
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try accepting
where you're at, man.</font>

389
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a pottery class or something.</font>

390
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:11,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Greendale, we're number one
Nancy Pelosi is no fun ♪♪</font>

391
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:16,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

392
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:18,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

393
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided to support Troy.</font>

394
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">They deploy things in football.
I went for rhyme over clarity.</font>

395
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:29,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry about before.</font>

396
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think we were both wrong.
Really?</font>

397
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:35,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm an 18-year-old girl
and you made me cry in public.</font>

398
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:38,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Okay, maybe I was
a little more wrong.</font>

399
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:42,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should grow up
and make peace with being here.</font>

400
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:45,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's not like Greendale
is gonna kill me or anything.</font>

401
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.
Oh!</font>

402
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:51,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Hey, say hello
to our ethnically neutral mascot,</font>

403
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Greendale Human Being.</font>

404
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">The costume makes it difficult
for him to see.</font>

405
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't move his mouth either.
But take it from me,</font>

406
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's human for "hello."</font>

407
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get you into the pep rally.
Great idea. Let's do it.</font>

408
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've solved racism. What's next?</font>

409
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do something for
little people. Or albinos.</font>

410
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:13,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about little albinos?</font>

411
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:17,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this has the potential to be
a uniquely Greendale experience.</font>

412
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady?</font>

413
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

414
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention, students, this is Abed.</font>

415
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:39,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the disco spider.</font>

416
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here at Greendale.
Greendale.</font>

417
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:42,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what?</font>

418
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:45,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few quick announcements.
Announcement number one.</font>

419
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:47,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">All announcements will be cool,
starting right now.</font>

420
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Announcement number two,
butt soup.</font>

421
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Announcement number three,</font>

422
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,418
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I am not Hadji from Jonny Quest,
Jeff Winger.</i></font>

423
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">On security news, you guys gotta
start locking the dean's door</font>

424
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">so guys like us don't get in.
Hey.</font>
