00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:04,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm failing
Psychopharmacology.</font>

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you taking that?</font>

3
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:09,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was a class
about crazy farm animals, okay?</font>

4
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's finish the unit.
I don't wanna be late for lunch.</font>

5
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,689
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Amar is to love, right?</i></font>

6
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:18,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, speaking of love, Shirley, how's
it going with the sexy dreadlock guy?</font>

7
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sure I don't have
a chance with him.</font>

8
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:23,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed and I talked to him
by the vending machine.</font>

9
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:25,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">He asked about you.
He specifically asked about me?</font>

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Annie brought you up, he
specifically asked, "Who is that?"</font>

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Oh.</font>

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
That's what he said.</font>

13
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:35,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, your social skills
aren't exactly streets ahead.</font>

14
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean?
I don't.</font>

15
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not alone in this case.
Pierce.</font>

16
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop trying to coin the phrase,
"Streets ahead."</font>

17
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:44,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying? Ha, ha.</font>

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coined and minted.</font>

19
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:47,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been there, coined that.</font>

20
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Streets ahead" is verbal wildfire.</font>

21
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:55,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it just mean cool, or is it
supposed to be like miles ahead?</font>

22
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have to ask,
you're streets behind.</font>

23
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. We can banter
if we wanna banter.</font>

24
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:02,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm leaving for lunch early.
Me too.</font>

25
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:03,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me three.
Streets ahead.</font>

26
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:06,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, you guys really love these
stupid chicken fingers, huh?</font>

27
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:09,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not stupid, they're the
only good thing in the cafeteria.</font>

28
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had one in weeks.
They run out so fast.</font>

29
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">If God were edible,
not that I'm Catholic,</font>

30
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if it was cool to eat God,
he'd be a chicken finger.</font>

31
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:17,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

32
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't know.
I'm a vegetarian.</font>

33
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:21,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shocker.
Yeah.</font>

34
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you guys knew how they treated
the animals that you're eating,</font>

35
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd eat them even faster just
to put them out of their misery.</font>

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you would throw up.</font>

37
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, maybe I'm feeling
extra protective of animals today</font>

38
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:35,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">because my cat is sick.</font>

39
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a cat?
That's awful.</font>

40
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has diabetes.</font>

41
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't even make it
to the litter box.</font>

42
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

43
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, go on.
God bless you.</font>

44
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save some for me.
Watch out.</font>

45
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I can hear those
fingers calling my name.</font>

46
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy.
Troy, Troy.</font>

47
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:10,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get my text message?
Did you get my text message?</font>

48
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's...</font>

49
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

50
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:19,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta stop hanging out with her.
She sounds like a chicken finger.</font>

51
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again?</font>

52
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outrageous.
At least apologize.</font>

53
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you just stand there
like a mute idiot?</font>

54
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.
Well,</font>

55
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:33,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">throat surgery
might humanize you.</font>

56
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:35,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't make
this acceptable.</font>

57
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:37,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">So cute.</font>

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't even normally
like dreadlocks.</font>

59
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

60
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">His dreadlocks remind me
of the Predator.</font>

61
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is weird because</font>

62
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:50,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're doing the actual hunting,
and you seem invisible to him.</font>

63
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you know what I do?</font>

64
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I talk, I ask myself:</font>

65
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:56,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What am I about to say?</font>

66
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how might it affect
each person listening?"</font>

67
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:00,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really glad you said that,
Britta.</font>

68
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The idea that you
compulsively filter yourself</font>

69
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes your lack of flavor
kind of a flavor.</font>

70
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:10,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, guys, they ran out again.
Something's gotta be done.</font>

71
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love chicken fingers.</font>

72
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Oh, you're the man.</font>

73
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, man?</font>

74
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's half our problem
right there.</font>

75
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-Burns works the fryer
and skims fingers.</font>

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

77
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:29,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gives them to people just so
they'll act like he isn't Star-Burns.</font>

78
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I may not eat meat, but I
am not gonna eat that injustice.</font>

79
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:33,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's complain.
Yeah.</font>

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we complain, he gets a warning
and learns to be sneakier.</font>

81
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:41,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we knock him out of the kitchen and replace
him with one of our own all in one move.</font>

82
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we're the ones
with the chicken.</font>

83
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a mafia movie.</font>

84
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,561
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As far back as I can remember,</i></font>

85
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,497
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I always wanted to be in
a mafia movie.</i></font>

86
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
That's exactly what it's like, Abed.</font>

87
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you get the most important job.
You're gonna be fry cook.</font>

88
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">We may be watching
different mafia movies.</font>

89
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worked in
your dad's restaurant, right?</font>

90
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you'll apply for the job
after we get Star-Burns fired.</font>

91
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:01,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I don't know about the firing.</font>

92
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:04,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he really relies on that income.
Yeah, man.</font>

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day you flock here
like sheep</font>

94
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:08,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wait in line for a broken
promise from a dirty system.</font>

95
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,753
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Back in those days, Jeff Winger was
the guy that made things happen.</i></font>

96
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,124
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He always knew what to say, and he
always knew when to slap the table.</i></font>

97
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna be sheep,
keep flocking.</font>

98
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna be wolves,
form a pack.</font>

99
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,993
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And that was it. It was that simple.</i></font>

100
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,435
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>At that moment,
we stopped being a family</i></font>

101
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,268
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and started being a family
in italics.</i></font>

102
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:29,906
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Britta got cozy with Star-Burns.</i></font>

103
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I touch both of...? Oh.
Yeah.</font>

104
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:33,479
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He lowered his guard.</i></font>

105
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,378
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He was gone.</i></font>

106
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:40,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I mean, the way Jeff saw it,
by not respecting us,</i></font>

107
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:42,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Star-Burns had basically
brought it on himself.</i></font>

108
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,822
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And when his job opened up,</i></font>

109
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,792
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>we did what we had to do to keep
the list of applicants to a minimum.</i></font>

110
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,761
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I had worked in my dad's falafel restaurant
, so I had a pretty impressive resume.</i></font>

111
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:51,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very impressive.</font>

112
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially your reference.
Just give them a call right now.</font>

113
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,703
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But we weren't taking any chances.
The fix was in.</i></font>

114
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trump Tower, this is Donald.</font>

115
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:04,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he can deep-fry the hell out
of chicken I can tell you that.</font>

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,309
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Troy even applied for the same job and
gave the world's worst interview.</i></font>

117
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just to make me look better,
and that was that.</i></font>

118
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:15,887
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This was the glorious time. No more
racing to the cafeteria. No more lines.</i></font>

119
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:19,220
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>To us, lines were for suckers,
hacks, sheep.</i></font>

120
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,396
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We were wolves.</i></font>

121
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,861
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And we had the chicken to prove it.</i></font>

122
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">To victory.</font>

123
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:31,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels unfamiliar,
but it tastes like chicken.</font>

124
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Hello.</font>

125
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are lucky.
They're always running out.</font>

126
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:40,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like one?</font>

127
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">The name's Shirley, memorize it.
I will, Shirley.</font>

128
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:47,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">See that, ladies?</font>

129
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">The universe goes by supply
and demand.</font>

130
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more you take and use,
the more it sends.</font>

131
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's been taking a little extra.
What's in that container?</font>

132
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight fingers.
Abed.</font>

133
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's study group.</font>

134
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why you giving Chang chicken?
We have an agreement.</font>

135
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get caught skimming,
you get fired.</font>

136
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:08,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all go back to eating like Britta.
Yeah, we put you in that job.</font>

137
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dressed like a crazy pharaoh
for you, man.</font>

138
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make the fingers, Abed,
not the decisions.</font>

139
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
It's okay, buddy.</font>

140
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just remember,
these things have power.</font>

141
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">So just let me know next time you
have any more agreements, all right?</font>

142
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I agreed to give Chang
eight fingers per lunch</font>

143
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">in exchange for a 10 percent bump
on every Spanish test for each of us.</font>

144
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:27,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

145
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Abed makes the fingers
and the decisions.</font>

146
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:34,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm gonna
pass Spanish class.</font>

147
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:37,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed, you're the best.</font>

148
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>At Greendale, they were
always out of chicken fingers.</i></font>

149
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,140
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So whoever could get them
had power.</i></font>

150
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,714
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I the guy was in the apron,
so I came up with a system.</i></font>

151
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:50,545
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And pretty soon half the chicken at
Greendale was going out the side door.</i></font>

152
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:55,616
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Everybody in our crew had a job.
T- Bone was the bag man.</i></font>

153
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:59,124
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He'd move the fingers to a storeroom
where two of the girls did the packaging.</i></font>

154
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:02,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We could trust them not to eat the
supply because Britta was a vegetarian.</i></font>

155
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,931
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And Shirley figured that if she stole,
she'd go to hell.</i></font>

156
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:10,463
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They'd hand the stuff out the window to Annie.
She was the leg man, the distributor.</i></font>

157
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,671
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The crazy thing was,
it was their food.</i></font>

158
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:18,313
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And we were stealing it and giving it
back to them like it was a big favor.</i></font>

159
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:21,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nobody asked any questions, because
Pierce's experience as a CEO</i></font>

160
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,711
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>had taught him how
to keep the wheels from squeaking.</i></font>

161
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,478
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I had it all worked out
on a schedule.</i></font>

162
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:27,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've never been fired.</font>

163
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,755
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The minute before
you thought about busting us,</i></font>

164
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that was the minute
you had chicken in your hand.</i></font>

165
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just insulting that
you're eating his chicken fingers</font>

166
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">in front of me.</font>

167
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,661
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Everyone had their hand out.
Everyone wanted what we had.</i></font>

168
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, here you go.</font>

169
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,166
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And Jeff had
the most important job of all.</i></font>

170
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,501
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He was at the top.
He was the boss.</i></font>

171
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He was our leader.</i></font>

172
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on?</font>

173
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">AV kids hooked it up.</font>

174
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed supplied the whole
department with chicken fingers.</font>

175
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:58,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's good, check out
my posse and Troy's monkey.</font>

176
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, why do you have a monkey?</font>

177
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an animal that
looks like a dude.</font>

178
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:04,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't I have 10 of them?</font>

179
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:08,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, look at what
Abed scored for me.</font>

180
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has a million zippers,</font>

181
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was free.</font>

182
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, robot.
I am a robot.</font>

183
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am programmed
to love this backpack.</font>

184
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:22,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane.</font>

185
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:26,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">More insane than programming
them to replace auto workers?</font>

186
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:27,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

187
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, if you're not
in this study group, please...</font>

188
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.
That means you, sexy dreadlocks.</font>

189
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's hairdresser.
What?</font>

190
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:39,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce's hackneyed entourage.
Hackneyed?</font>

191
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:40,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see the turban guy?</font>

192
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, in a '90s ski movie
that featured an entourage.</font>

193
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you guys think
this is getting out of hand?</font>

194
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna get caught.</font>

195
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have campus security
on the take.</font>

196
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's got it all figured out.</font>

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a relief.
Yeah.</font>

198
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty cool being friends
with the biggest man on campus.</font>

199
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that right, Annie's Boobs?</font>

200
00:08:58,447 --> 00:08:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please rename that thing.</font>

201
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:01,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this time,
not with a contest on Twitter.</font>

202
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his Twitter account.
He can do what he wants.</font>

203
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are my body parts.</font>

204
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:08,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what I don't appreciate?
I do not consent to this.</font>

205
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be begging for his company.
I own that.</font>

206
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't threaten a monkey.
They have more lactic acid than us.</font>

207
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shared my chicken with him.
Talk to the backpack.</font>

208
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst, Annie.
Streets ahead.</font>

209
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, where's he going?</font>

210
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Line starts behind you.
Oh, he's cool.</font>

211
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six fingers every Wednesday.</font>

212
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. And what can you offer?
I have a bicycle.</font>

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I teach beginner's tennis.
Cool, okay.</font>

214
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six fingers Wednesdays,
all right.</font>

215
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be in touch, Janel.</font>

216
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Abed.
You're welcome.</font>

217
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:52,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff.
Hey, buddy.</font>

218
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:56,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite a setup you got here.
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it.</font>

219
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">It turns out everyone has needs
and everyone has functions.</font>

220
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I've been thinking.</font>

221
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I need to hit the big red button
and bring an end to this operation.</font>

222
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:09,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's been fun,
but it's out of control now.</font>

223
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I right?
I don't know.</font>

224
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">The entire campus
is controlled by our group.</font>

225
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:16,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our group is controlled by chicken,
and the chicken is controlled by me.</font>

226
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Float?
I'm good.</font>

227
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:23,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, the mafia movie is over.
I'm not doing a mafia movie.</font>

228
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:26,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I don't need to use movies or
TV shows to talk to people anymore.</font>

229
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I only needed them because the
day-to-day world made no sense to me.</font>

230
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now, everyone's speaking
the same language, chicken.</font>

231
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand people
and they finally understand me.</font>

232
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, eventually people
are gonna get tired of chicken.</font>

233
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm tired of chicken.</font>

234
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not tired of chicken.
You miss the taste of control.</font>

235
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's crazy.</font>

236
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:47,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

237
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, the very thing
that drove you to this dorm room</font>

238
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:55,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">is what would prevent you
from properly running this machine.</font>

239
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or even being a cog in it, your ego.</font>

240
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:04,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see. I see, this has been
about me the whole time.</font>

241
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a shot
at the Jeff Winger throne?</font>

242
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:10,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better bring a powerful ass.</font>

243
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and for your information,
I don't have an ego.</font>

244
00:11:14,783 --> 00:11:17,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Facebook photo
is a landscape.</font>

245
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the best, Eduardo.</font>

246
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you all for coming.</font>

247
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we make this quick?
I need to give a banana to Annie's Boobs.</font>

248
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed is drunk with chicken power.</font>

249
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:35,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gone from lovable Johnny Five
to evil HAL.</font>

250
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hal Holb...
Not Hal Holbrook.</font>

251
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you saying?
You all have to stop working for him.</font>

252
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let this operation dry up
and let his wheels spin down.</font>

253
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">At which point you would
be in charge again, right?</font>

254
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
This is so sad.</font>

255
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're jealous of Abed
because he's providing for us.</font>

256
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:55,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm concerned about Abed
because he won't listen to reason.</font>

257
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't listen to your reason.</font>

258
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should he?
Jeff's so not...</font>

259
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:01,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, "Streets ahead," and die.</font>

260
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Streets ahead.</font>

261
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna boss me around?</font>

262
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me an entourage.
Get Troy a monkey.</font>

263
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what a real boss does.
Yes.</font>

264
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">We probably shouldn't even be talking
to him without checking with Abed.</font>

265
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already trying him, he's not picking up.
What did you do with him?</font>

266
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe what greedy sellouts
you people turned out to be.</font>

267
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna stand and be ignored.
Shh. Voicemail.</font>

268
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:25,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed, Jeff says you're
not listening to him.</font>

269
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that mean we shouldn't
listen to him either?</font>

270
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:31,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, also, should we make special
jackets for our crime family?</font>

271
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like blazers with
chicken finger patches.</font>

272
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, long
message, I'm sorry.</font>

273
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:36,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

274
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Abed.</font>

275
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm walking out
this door right now.</font>

276
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:43,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Okay, bye.</font>

277
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:44,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real.
Good.</font>

278
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna look back.
Mm-hm.</font>

279
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye.
Goodbye.</font>

280
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Hi, hi, yeah.</font>

281
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody need anything?
Oh, everything,</font>

282
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">you look handsome.</font>

283
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like everything about you now.
You get the message?</font>

284
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a new hairdresser though.</font>

285
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Oh.</font>

286
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:14,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's my hair look?
Oh. I like this.</font>

287
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got you fired.</font>

288
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:26,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserved it.
Maybe, maybe not.</font>

289
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question is,
what do they deserve?</font>

290
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Key to the kitchen.</font>

291
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:42,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a valve on the back of the
chicken fryer that's not made anymore.</font>

292
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:46,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, say someone were
to remove it.</font>

293
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fryer wouldn't work.</font>

294
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:52,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forever.
How petty do you think I am?</font>

295
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,156
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff leaving the family
didn't turn out to be a problem.</i></font>

296
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think
we're set for the quiz.</font>

297
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.
See you guys in class.</font>

298
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, before you go.</font>

299
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, free notebooks.</font>

300
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,405
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But the family's success
started to go to their heads.</i></font>

301
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:15,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't have college ruled?
No, sorry.</font>

302
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

303
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:23,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?
Yeah?</font>

304
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.</font>

305
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a situation.</font>

306
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Who is this?</font>

307
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Travis.</font>

308
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you wanted someone in
your entourage named Travis.</font>

309
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him your license.</font>

310
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Travis is his middle name.</font>

311
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go by Travis.
No, you go by the door.</font>

312
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you, Travis.</font>

313
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?
Yep?</font>

314
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

315
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">My monkey hates this caviar.</font>

316
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, isn't that...?</font>

317
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,253
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They were spoiled, fat, lazy.</i></font>

318
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,587
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'd given them everything
and somehow I'd lost their respect.</i></font>

319
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:05,627
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I did the only thing
I could think of.</i></font>

320
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,823
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I did what I thought Jeff would do.</i></font>

321
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,865
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I sent them a message.</i></font>

322
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:24,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's backpack.</font>

323
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>These were the bad times.</i></font>

324
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:12,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.
Jeff, Jeff.</font>

325
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.
Jeff.</font>

326
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Abed killed my backpack.</font>

327
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I caught him stuffing
my man full of chicken.</font>

328
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Tyler Perry has a series
of movies about why that's wrong.</font>

329
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little Arab is off his rocker.</font>

330
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:26,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He released Annie's Boobs.
Annie's Boobs could be anywhere. Could be...</font>

331
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:29,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got it.
The monkey's name is Annie's Boobs.</font>

332
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:31,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what Abed did to my hair.</font>

333
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:34,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel terrible for all of you.</font>

334
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, no, I don't, because
I warned you about all this.</font>

335
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:39,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were so high on your
backpacks and hairstyles,</font>

336
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:41,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">you accused me of being jealous.</font>

337
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.
But what can we do?</font>

338
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, you brushed over
that first part.</font>

339
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together.</font>

340
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

341
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what you can do is go home and
write that on your bathroom mirror.</font>

342
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't that make it seem
like I was right?</font>

343
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
I don't have a mirror.</font>

344
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not reversed
because you're the...</font>

345
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have the mirror behind you.
And I would like...</font>

346
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:10,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for Abed, for his sake
I guess I'll have to take him out.</font>

347
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:15,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor little guy.
Oh, good, that's nice.</font>

348
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

349
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:39,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Making Tater Tots.</font>

350
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:42,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right, people got sick
of chicken, but I was close.</font>

351
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need a new food,
a new system.</font>

352
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna experiment with jalapeño
poppers next, and then Zucchini Zircles.</font>

353
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.
It's not that complicated, Jeff.</font>

354
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">They replaced the C in circle
with a Z for zucchini.</font>

355
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I mean, why are you here?</font>

356
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you were close?</font>

357
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you close to?</font>

358
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the group?</font>

359
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">To people?
Don't do a special episode about me.</font>

360
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:08,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I wouldn't dream of it.</font>

361
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else needs my help.</font>

362
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:17,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what people don't get,
is that they need to get me.</font>

363
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to be able to connect to people like
you can, and then I can make everyone happy.</font>

364
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why I'm here?
You got caught with a fake degree.</font>

365
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,268
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>By the way, they started using
that on Law & Order.</i></font>

366
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Total rip off.</font>

367
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:37,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to dismantle the fryer.</font>

368
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:40,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">To cut your power off at its source.</font>

369
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see what happened?</font>

370
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I manipulated the group
into getting you the fry cook job</font>

371
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could have some chicken.</font>

372
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you turned it all into a way
to make everyone like you.</font>

373
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:57,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made me ashamed of myself,
made me jealous.</font>

374
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:58,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe this is a special episode.</font>

375
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty alarming behavior, Jeff.
Yeah.</font>

376
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's specialists you could talk to.
Maybe I should do that.</font>

377
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:08,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,
let's make a deal.</font>

378
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:12,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll help you connect with people, and
you help me do a better job with them.</font>

379
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,536
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like Knight Rider.
Exactly.</i></font>

380
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,908
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like Knight Rider.
Deal.</i></font>

381
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll put on a leather jacket and make
out with an aerobics instructor.</font>

382
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:24,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pull around front and comedically startle
passers-by with your ability to talk.</font>

383
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should just stay here
and have a plate of chicken fingers.</font>

384
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

385
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,290
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Can we eat them while sitting on a
table like in Sixteen Candles?</i></font>

386
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:32,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick one reference, Abed.</font>

387
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,561
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sixteen Candles.</i></font>

388
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,526
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And just like that,
the mafia movie was over.</i></font>

389
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,931
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I quit the fry cook job,
somewhat for the sake of the family,</i></font>

390
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:44,007
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but mostly for the sake of Jeff's ego,
poor guy.</i></font>

391
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,173
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Things went back to normal.</i></font>

392
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,404
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Everyone's back to being
a bunch of regular schnooks.</i></font>

393
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I'm back to being a weirdo.</i></font>

394
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:55,313
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Back to watching
from the outside for now.</i></font>

395
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:58,085
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There's still not enough
chicken fingers.</i></font>

396
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way, no seriously.
What?</font>

397
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,356
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As soon as our family moved out, a new
syndicate moved in to take its place.</i></font>

398
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:07,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what they'll never
make a replacement for?</font>

399
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends.</font>

400
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thank you.
That's great, Abed.</font>

401
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">But could you
just answer the question?</font>

402
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was it?</font>

403
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who might have stolen
a box of hairnets from the kitchen?</font>

404
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone with hair.
I'm gonna write that down.</font>

405
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:30,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

406
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:34,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.
Never been done.</font>

407
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:37,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here I come.
Back up the same staircase.</font>

408
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good.
Double escalator.</font>

409
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. I haven't seen that before.
How did you think of that?</font>

410
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:48,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now for our signature trick.
Awesome elevator.</font>

411
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:50,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I can't do it.</font>

412
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got babies.
I gotta get home.</font>

413
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:53,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's their loss.
Yeah.</font>

414
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was awesome.
Yeah.</font>
