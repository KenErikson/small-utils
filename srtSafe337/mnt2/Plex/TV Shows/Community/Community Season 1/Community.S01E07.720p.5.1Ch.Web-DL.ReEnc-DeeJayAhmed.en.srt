This is my first college party.</font>

you took off your wedding ring.</font>

for six months.</font>

22

Oh, I have a conflict.</font>

28
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">It conflicts with
the enjoyment of my life.</font>

29
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:26,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot figure out the voice
command part of this thing.</font>

wanna beat a dead horse here,</font>

00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:40,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure.
Okay, good.</font>

35
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because one of my professors is really hot.
And I wanted to give you first right of refusal.</font>

44
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:43,156

brush up on chapters three and four.</font>

45

51
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:02,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little aggressive. But as a busy, confident woman
of authority I'm attracted to men who take charge.</font>

52
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You being sarcastic
or am I nailing it?</font>

53
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were nailing it
until you had to ask.</font>

54
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, damn it. Starting over.</font>

55
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you in the skirt, date me.
I'd like to, Mr. Winger.</font>

56
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:12,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're tall, dress nice.</font>

57
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:15,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've graded enough of your tests to know
I'd never feel mentally inadequate.</font>

58
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Only problem, I don't date students.</font>

59
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:23,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, if you agree to go...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hey. Awkward.</font>

61
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:26,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How small is this campus?</font>

62
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:27,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard.</font>

63
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine, I don't care.</font>

64
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:30,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's disgusting
the way men behave.</font>

65
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever see that Katherine Heigl movie poster,
where Gerard Butler had that heart over his wiener?</font>

66
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:35,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">That resonated with me.</font>

67
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine. But just to repeat,
I don't care what Jeff does.</font>

68
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard.</font>

69
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:43,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm barely a student.
I'm older than you, I drive a Lexus.</font>

70
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,915
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I saw Ghost Busters in the theater.
Look, my gums are receding.</i></font>

71
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:48,489

my buttons you're finding,</font>

72
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have a personal rule
about this and I stick to it.</font>

73
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:53,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a cup of coffee with me,
I can change your mind.</font>

74
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you can. That's why
you're not getting the chance.</font>

75
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo.</font>

76
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:03,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming to my party?
I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.</font>

77
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:06,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I can mark you down
as definitely being there</font>

78
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:08,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">from 7:00 sharp
until question mark?</font>

79
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:10,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing...
No, here's the thing.</font>

80
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am putting my foot down,
do you understand?</font>

81
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am being assertive,
and I am making eye contact,</font>

82
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:19,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it is achieving results.
Trying to get formidable with me?</font>

83
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">It worked on Pierce.
Infomercials work on Pierce.</font>

84
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?</font>

85
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you show up,
it will be the first party I host</font>

86
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">where everyone doesn't say they need
to get home in time for the news.</font>

87
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:33,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">This won't work.</font>

88
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:36,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time you did this,
I saved a vial of your tears.</font>

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been slowly
building up an immunity.</font>

90
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:39,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so unpopular in high school,</font>

91
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">the crossing guard
used to lure me into traffic.</font>

92
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">This party is a second chance</font>

93
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:49,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">at being hip, cool,</font>

94
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">laid-back.</font>

95
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:57,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I will come to your party.
Thank you.</font>

96
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:00,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm putting you down for two bags
of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.</font>

97
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking a pill?</font>

98
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.
"Xenolovaden."</font>

99
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandpa took that
around your age.</font>

100
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantastic.
Helped him with his going problem.</font>

101
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time Grandpa got up in years, his
memory wasn't great. He'd mix the wrong pills.</font>

102
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:30,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how old people are.
Heard stories about it.</font>

103
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time he started hallucinating and
ran down the street with no pants on,</font>

104
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real
party foul so you should probably be careful.</font>

105
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I really don't need your advice,
and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.</font>

106
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. "Pantsless grandpa."
Heh, heh.</font>

107
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary.</font>

108
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look great.</font>

109
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

110
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta,</font>

111
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">you look adorable.
Thank you.</font>

112
00:05:57,154 --> 00:06:00,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate when women use Halloween as an
excuse to dress up like sluts, you know?</font>

113
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:02,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

114
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everyone.</font>

115
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:07,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we can begin.</font>

116
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:11,867
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've got everyone's personalized
cookie tombstones, por tradición.</i></font>

117
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, in a few minutes we're going
to start the Dance of the Dead,</font>

118
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>La Danza de los Muertos.</i></font>

119
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to keep doing that.
Party on.</font>

120
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice of you to be here, I'm sure you'd
rather be out with your hot professor.</font>

121
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:32,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's funny.
I enrolled here as a selfish Ioner.</font>

122
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you and the group have given
me a crash course in friendship.</font>

123
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">She blew you off, huh?
She's grading papers.</font>

124
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:38,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Slater?</font>

125
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:41,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not grading papers, she's at
the faculty party in the cafeteria.</font>

126
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look. It's the
eavesdropping matador.</font>

127
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying
my people are sneaky?</font>

128
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

129
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:50,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a
storm building on the horizon,</font>

130
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:52,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you and I
will save the night.</font>

131
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chex mix, pretzels,
baby carrots.</font>

132
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Predictable but appetizing.</font>

133
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Hey.</font>

134
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you something that I
always wanted to ask real Batman?</font>

135
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:07,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I good-looking?
You're a very attractive young man.</font>

136
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it.</font>

137
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get this party started.</font>

138
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:15,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

139
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the Beastmaster.</font>

140
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,903
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>From the movie, Beastmaster.</i></font>

141
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">What rock
have you been living under?</font>

142
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going as?
A gay douche bag?</font>

143
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:28,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kidding.
Nice one.</font>

144
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not much of a costume guy.</font>

145
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not much of
a liking-ladies guy either.</font>

146
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:34,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Body blow.</font>

147
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that liquor?</font>

148
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.
Here's your drinks, mates.</font>

149
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:40,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Thanks, Urkel.</font>

150
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Harry Potter.</font>

151
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:45,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
What up, Urkel?</font>

152
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:55,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

153
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. What are you taking?</font>

154
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:00,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Oh.</font>

155
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the usual cool stuff.</font>

156
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got ludes, dreamers,
Johnny Boys.</font>

157
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:08,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what, I'll...</font>

158
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll trade you one of mine
for two of yours.</font>

159
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Star-Burns, I'm...</font>

160
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:17,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry. I thought I was
dealing with the Beastmaster.</font>

161
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Who said you weren't?
Heh, heh, heh.</font>

162
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saddle up, fruit pie.</font>

163
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind if I do. May I?</font>

164
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, take this.</font>

165
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:30,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give anyone that shows up
their stupid credit.</font>

166
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You going to the faculty party?
Make me your plus one.</font>

167
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up, Winger.
Professor Slater doesn't date students.</font>

168
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or married Asians
who drive mopeds.</font>

169
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you 20 bucks.</font>

170
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring the hog around.</font>

171
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, it's time for
the Dance of the Dead.</font>

172
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone form a circle.</font>

173
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:04,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lights. Music.</font>

174
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:06,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it under genre
or on a specific play list?</font>

175
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, what'd you slip me?</font>

176
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep grinding my teeth
and I wanna kiss everybody.</font>

177
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you slip me, man?</font>

178
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">My heart stopped racing
and I can't pee.</font>

179
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:20,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, for the first dance,</font>

180
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to invite
a very special guest to the floor.</font>

181
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger?</font>

182
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:31,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff?</font>

183
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Jeff?</font>

184
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please slow down.</font>

185
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.
Stop crying, Winger.</font>

186
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:39,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it!</font>

187
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Jeff gone?</font>

188
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna miss the news.</font>

189
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:46,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">News.</font>

190
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:50,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just stepped out.
He's gonna be right back.</font>

191
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to
the faculty party.</font>

192
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:57,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be with Professor Short Skirt?
We hate her.</font>

193
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not about her,
Shirley.</font>

194
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:02,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe that
Jeff would do this to Annie.</font>

195
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, absolutely, it's about Annie.</font>

196
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:07,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go find that bitch's car
and snap off her antenna.</font>

197
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like high school all over again.</font>

198
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's leaving.</font>

199
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me.</font>

200
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do this all night.</font>

201
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

202
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:31,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, pretty lady.</font>

203
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
Showing you my non-student side.</font>

204
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:36,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to admit, this
outfit is doing it for me.</font>

205
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may or may not have been deflowered
by a junior rodeo champion.</font>

206
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me
of my first time too.</font>

207
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:43,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lost your virginity
to Robin Hood?</font>

208
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:44,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, with an attractive woman
at a party.</font>

209
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:46,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">We seem destined to repeat history.</font>

210
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:50,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, no students. It's unseemly.
I go out with you, you tell your friends.</font>

211
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:54,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">What friends? I have no friends,
I hate everyone here but you.</font>

212
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
What are you doing here?</font>

213
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
You should be over at the library with Annie.</font>

214
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:04,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Yippee ki-yay.</font>

215
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you weren't a costume guy.
Had to have one to get in, squirrel.</font>

216
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. So where did you get it?</font>

217
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't think any costume
stores would be open this late.</font>

218
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
what you're getting at.</font>

219
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:16,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">The words you're looking for are,
"I own a cowboy outfit."</font>

220
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is tight too.
Did you buy it like that?</font>

221
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your toy gun to my head,
I'd say yes.</font>

222
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Michelle Slater, PhD.</font>

223
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta Perry, GED.
Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's?</font>

224
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:29,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you say classmate, it sounds like
we take naps together and eat paste.</font>

225
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's great about
community college is</font>

226
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:34,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that a lot of the students
are as mature as the teachers.</font>

227
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you must return
to Annie's party.</font>

228
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:37,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's feeling unpopular.</font>

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Pierce took something
and he is tripping balls.</font>

230
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:42,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's touching people
and dancing weird.</font>

231
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,196
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's like Grumpy Old Men,
but not hilarious.</i></font>

232
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:49,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Guys, I'm at a grown-up
Halloween party, all right?</font>

233
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:50,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all being unseemly.</font>

234
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:53,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
How are we unseemly?</font>

235
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:57,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Urkel ripping the antenna
off Professor Slater's car?</font>

236
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Professor Slim Calves.</font>

237
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what you get when
you steal Jeff from a good woman.</font>

238
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Abed.</font>

239
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he meowing?
Yeah.</font>

240
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.
I want you guys out of here.</font>

241
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:26,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I don't care about
your high school soap opera.</font>

242
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you're not Batman.</font>

243
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, Pierce, Pierce.</font>

244
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop grinding on
the Women's Studies department.</font>

245
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:35,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are too old to be tripping.</font>

246
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm old?</font>

247
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean old?</font>

248
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's hands are these?</font>

249
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop me.</font>

250
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:51,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go.</font>

251
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I'm not Batman.
You could try not being a jerk.</font>

252
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's pretty hot.</font>

253
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, where were we,
little doggie?</font>

254
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unseemly.
Yeah, crap.</font>

255
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley?</font>

256
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley?</font>

257
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is
Professor Robin Hood's office.</font>

258
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:20,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

259
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Putting this hose in her desk.
You turn the water on.</font>

260
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:24,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

261
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">To teach that long neck,
weave-having bank teller</font>

262
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">she can't steal another
woman's man, that's why.</font>

263
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

264
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a confession to make.</font>

265
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:40,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think some of what I just said may
have more to do with my situation.</font>

266
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:44,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, the long neck, weave-having
bank teller didn't feel universal.</font>

267
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">My ex-husband came by this morning,
and he asked for his ring back.</font>

268
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:51,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was his mother's,</font>

269
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he wants to give it
to his new girlfriend.</font>

270
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:56,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, that sucks.</font>

271
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best thing that ever
happened to me was him leaving.</font>

272
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:01,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just always thought
he'd come crawling back,</font>

273
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd get to tell him to go to hell.</font>

274
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">He couldn't even give me that.</font>

275
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what the crazy thing is?</font>

276
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything you've done tonight?</font>

277
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I was too proud
to admit I was hurt,</font>

278
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I had to pretend that you were.</font>

279
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I totally get that.</font>

280
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel better now.</font>

281
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go check on Annie.</font>

282
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe
I targeted this poor lady?</font>

283
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:37,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at all these awards,
I bet she's nice.</font>

284
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

285
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:42,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice and pretentious.</font>

286
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, are you okay?</font>

287
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, what's going on?</font>

288
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:59,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a full-on erection.</font>

289
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just relax. Relax, man.</font>

290
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:04,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just relax. Just relax, okay?</font>

291
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,104
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You are too old to be tripping.</i></font>

292
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to die.</font>

293
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You are too old to be tripping.</i></font>

294
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about The Beatles, Pierce.</font>

295
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about Woodstock
and sputnik, Pierce.</font>

296
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I feel a breeze here?</font>

297
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because someone
just struck out.</font>

298
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:41,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">She blew you off too, Chang.</font>

299
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh, heh, heh.
Is that what you have to fall back on?</font>

300
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me, bro. Look at me.</font>

301
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got the body of
a fifth grader, okay?</font>

302
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I was working
with what you've got,</font>

303
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">she'd be at the Comfort Inn right
now giving me a Mexican Halloween.</font>

304
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's this campus.
It feeds on my coolness.</font>

305
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got no moves anymore.</font>

306
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:01,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moves? Everything's
a game to guys like you.</font>

307
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:05,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know one move I bet you've
never tried in your life.</font>

308
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

309
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please sleep with me. Please.</font>

310
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:21,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty please. I'm so lonely.</font>

311
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:24,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't slept with anyone in a very
long time, and you're so good-looking.</font>

312
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please do me the favor
of having sex with me.</font>

313
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:35,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Stay three steps behind
and promise you won't tell anybody.</font>

314
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise. I promise.</font>

315
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:53,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody stay out of the library.</font>

316
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, it's okay.
Come out of there.</font>

317
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not ready to die.</font>

318
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna die. Look at me.</font>

319
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just keep walking.
Don't make eye contact.</font>

320
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:05,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.</font>

321
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce is freaking out.
You're the only one that can help.</font>

322
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think that?</font>

323
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Jeff there?
He's the only one who can help.</font>

324
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:14,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he's gonna kill himself
but he doesn't want us to call 911</font>

325
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he doesn't wanna
get in trouble for taking drugs.</font>

326
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:23,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I'm doing this.</font>

327
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh...</font>

328
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I have to say good night.</font>

329
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:34,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you, like, a court appointed
guardian for these people?</font>

330
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Heh. Um...</font>

331
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're my classmates.</font>

332
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Jeff.</font>

333
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loser.</font>

334
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the Pink Floyd?</font>

335
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:03,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna crush myself to
death with desks and tables, Jeff.</font>

336
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:05,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a death
befitting a beastmaster?</font>

337
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,156
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I never saw Beastmaster
, I just wanted to be cool.</i></font>

338
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming in there, Pierce.</font>

339
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:23,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those floating Mexican skeletons were right.
My life is over.</font>

340
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:27,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when we go to floating
skeletons with our problems,</font>

341
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">we get what we pay for,
don't we?</font>

342
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm old, Jeff.</font>

343
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I don't know how
you spent the first 60 years,</font>

344
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I know
in the last two months,</font>

345
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:42,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've probably doubled
the national average</font>

346
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">for amount of life lived
per lifetime.</font>

347
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:49,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do have
a young African American friend.</font>

348
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:53,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and more importantly,
you're dressed like a gladiator</font>

349
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a desk fort
that you built during a bad trip.</font>

350
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">If life is just a series of
ridiculous attempts to be alive,</font>

351
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're a hero to everything
that's ever lived.</font>

352
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
Yeah.</font>

353
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

354
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:29,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman?</font>

355
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:30,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

356
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you staying for the party?</font>

357
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:38,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I stay there can be no party.</font>

358
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must be out there in the night,
staying vigilant.</font>

359
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:49,522
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wherever a party needs
to be saved, I'm there.</i></font>

360
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,359
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wherever there are masks,
wherever there's tomfoolery and joy,</i></font>

361
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,257
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm there.</i></font>

362
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:58,790
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But sometimes I'm not</i></font>

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,333
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>because I'm out in the night,
staying vigilant, watching.</i></font>

364
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:07,600
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Lurking, running, jumping,
hurdling, sleeping.</i></font>

365
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:08,969
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, I can't sleep.</i></font>

366
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,077
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You sleep. I'm awake.</i></font>

367
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,747
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't sleep, I don't blink.</i></font>

368
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,912
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Am I a bird? No.</i></font>

369
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:17,812
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm a bat.</i></font>

370
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,621
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I am Batman.</i></font>

371
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,948
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Or am I?</i></font>

372
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,651
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, I am Batman.</i></font>

373
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,419
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Happy Halloween.</i></font>

374
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Batman.</font>

375
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:34,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound like Cookie Monster.</font>

376
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Batman.</font>

377
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Batman.</font>

378
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Candy corn
looks like tiny traffic cones.</font>

379
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:41,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it sure does.</font>

380
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">At, like, a candy traffic school.</font>

381
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a little gingerbread man
at the wheel, and he's drunk.</font>

382
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out.
We driving.</font>

383
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:52,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you keep wanting
to eat yourself.</font>

384
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:53,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">All day.</font>

385
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:54,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of my biggest fears.</font>

386
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?
If I ever, like, woke up as a doughnut.</font>

387
00:20:57,993 --> 00:21:00,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would eat yourself.
I wouldn't even question it.</font>

388
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. That would be tasty.</font>

389
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:05,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool to know other people
think about this stuff too.</font>

390
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

391
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:08,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>
