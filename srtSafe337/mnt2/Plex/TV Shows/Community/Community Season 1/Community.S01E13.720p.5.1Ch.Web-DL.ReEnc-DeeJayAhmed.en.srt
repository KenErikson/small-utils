00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:04,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome back.</font>

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Hello.</font>

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:08,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do over break?</font>

4
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:11,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's so awesome. Me and Abed
played this video game. It's so dope.</font>

5
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:13,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a whole city.
You can drive anywhere.</font>

6
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:14,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can rent an apartment.
Do taxes.</font>

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't get audited.
Because that's bad.</font>

8
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could even enroll
in community college.</font>

9
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:21,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, it sounds
as boring as real life, but it is not.</font>

10
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vacations are wasted
on the young.</font>

11
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys gotta get out there
and see the world</font>

12
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:28,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">at some point or you're gonna
miss your entire lives.</font>

13
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:31,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you go, Britta?
Amsterdam, I think.</font>

14
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:32,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll know more
when I find my camera.</font>

15
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what happened to me.</font>

16
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Pierce,
you became a grandfather?</font>

17
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:39,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I became even cooler.</font>

18
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:41,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">These ironic T-shirts
are all the rage.</font>

19
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:44,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get one thing straight.</font>

20
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:47,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I was still a lawyer, I'm only
here because I'm hot for Britta,</font>

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't want to be
anybody's friend.</font>

22
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:54,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kidding.
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.</font>

23
00:00:58,677 --> 00:00:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I gotta say,</font>

24
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I took a look back
at the guy I was last semester,</font>

25
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I realized,
that guy was a drag.</font>

26
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:07,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Good to hear you admit it, Jeff.</font>

27
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the truth is,
this is a new semester, a new Jeff.</font>

28
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:14,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is where I am
and I am gonna make the best of it.</font>

29
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:17,094
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, that's nice.
You're like Hawkeye on M* A*S*H.</i></font>

30
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kept his upbeat humor and charm, even
in the 11 th year of the Korean War.</font>

31
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Well, don't go
changing too much, Jeff.</font>

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we all like you
just the way you were.</font>

33
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I appreciate that, but...</font>

34
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just teleport here?</font>

35
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I snuck in
during the group hug.</font>

36
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:35,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys don't remember me?</font>

37
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:37,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy, from Spanish class.</font>

38
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
it's Buddy from Spanish class.</font>

39
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen you
before in my life.</font>

40
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know you.
I've seen Buddy before.</font>

41
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sits in the corner,
next to the dead plant.</font>

42
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">From watching you
all last semester grow together.</font>

43
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:00,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">F. F minus.</font>

44
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you say S?
He said F.</font>

45
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cheated?
I did it.</font>

46
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta cheated?</font>

47
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?</font>

48
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me back my bra, Annie.</font>

49
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:17,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. I'm not even wearing a bra.
Ugh! Ugh!</font>

50
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even care who wins.
What?</font>

51
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sleep a lot in class,
that one might have been a dream.</font>

52
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Buddy, as you know, we
haven't had Spanish class yet,</font>

53
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:33,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">so this meeting was more just for
catching up between friends.</font>

54
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:36,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard that. Let's do it.</font>

55
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe...
So, I... Heh.</font>

56
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Britta.</font>

57
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go first. Uh...</font>

58
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:45,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you guys
have a natural rapport and timing,</font>

59
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:48,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know you're scared
that adding a new member</font>

60
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">might throw everything off
of its natural...</font>

61
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:01,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- rhythm, but I feel like
I know you guys already.</font>

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know, let me in, just tell
me the rules, and I will follow.</font>

63
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you already broke
the only rule I have.</font>

64
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rule about
worrying about rules.</font>

65
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:13,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm saying too.</font>

66
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

67
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Spanish studying is better ♪</font>

68
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:24,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ When you're Buddy-ing around
Yeah ♪♪</font>

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff.
Hey.</font>

70
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:33,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Um...</font>

71
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:36,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I received a text message
about free Sephora samples?</font>

72
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:38,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha. It was me. Ha-ha.</font>

73
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about the ruse,
but I have something better</font>

74
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:45,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">than exfoliating soap
to rub on you.</font>

75
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">An opportunity. Mm.</font>

76
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:52,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see, I am resurrecting the
Greendale Gazette Journal Mirror.</font>

77
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we need a student editor.</font>

78
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:57,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone with a real world savvy that
extends beyond how to huff the ink.</font>

79
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:01,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, dean, I'm resolved
to spend this semester being more...</font>

80
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would be your office.</font>

81
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relaxed and awesome.</font>

82
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first desk I've seen in six months
that doesn't have "Zeppelin Rules" carved into it.</font>

83
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you get an English credit.</font>

84
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that ain't bad neither. I'm in.
Yeah.</font>

85
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, meet your new editor.</font>

86
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger is very excited to help you
bring a voice back to the campus.</font>

87
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I need to take your picture.</font>

88
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:27,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, we got it.
Okay.</font>

89
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:28,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys knock yourselves out.</font>

90
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome aboard, Jeff. This is my article
on the school's new water heater.</font>

91
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got chops, kid. But we need
your talent on a bigger story.</font>

92
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pizza wars.
Who's got the best slice in town?</font>

93
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start with Big Nick's.
Bring us a large with sausage.</font>

94
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:45,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. I heard a rumor that Riley's
Liquor is selling to underage students.</font>

95
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I need an undercover exposé.</font>

96
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find out how much they'll sell you
of anything cold and imported.</font>

97
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You expect me to watch you
do that without telling on you?</font>

98
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:57,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a hard-hitting question, Annie.
Are you a reporter?</font>

99
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. They've got me editing
the crossword because I'm a girl.</font>

100
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:04,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because I love crosswords.
Well, now you love the streets.</font>

101
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my ace newshound.
Ace? You can do that?</font>

102
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can do anything we want.
It's Greendale.</font>

103
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go find me that story.</font>

104
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">This character reboot is
really gelling for you, Jeff.</font>

105
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was all classic Hawkeye.</font>

106
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:17,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sending soldiers out for liquor.</font>

107
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:22,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slyly sidestepping the problematic
scrutiny of Annie "Hot Lips" Edison. Mm?</font>

108
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should build you a still
for making Hawkeye martinis.</font>

109
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of all your pop cultural fixations,
this is one I can work with, Abed.</font>

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me Radar?
When you've earned it.</font>

111
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I know the news
of Señor Chang's death</font>

112
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">over winter break
was a shock to us all.</font>

113
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:40,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we should take comfort
in the fact</font>

114
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:44,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he did not suffer when his
moped hit the side of that Arby's.</font>

115
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sad.</font>

116
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">But best semester ever. Heh-heh.</font>

117
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:57,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh-heh. Beat it. All right.</font>

118
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a professional actress.</font>

119
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a man who can never die,</font>

120

127
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,238

128
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. See you in study group.</font>

129
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:39,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoo-aah! Aah!</font>

130
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:43,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Jeff, can he really just decide
he's one of us?</font>

131
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">He throws off our balance.</font>

132
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:49,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got three chicks, three dudes,
and now, two weirdoes. Heh.</font>

133
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:51,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Abed.
Not all weirdoes are bad.</font>

134
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy might be a puckish agent
of change that changes our lives</font>

135
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:54,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the better
through a musical montage.</font>

136
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or he could have a row of jars
waiting for our genitals.</font>

137
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, I need my genitals.</font>

138
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who you guys sound like?</font>

139
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, from last semester.</font>

140
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cynical. Elitist.
Oh.</font>

141
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakishly good-looking.
Thank you.</font>

142
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:10,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we should at least get together to
talk about membership policies, right?</font>

143
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:11,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't ask me.</font>

144
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dealing with problems
ain't my job no more.</font>

145
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:18,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">My new job is hanging out,
having fun and cracking wise.</font>

146
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:21,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, must be nice.
Suppose I decide that's my job?</font>

147
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

148
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you've got an army of raisins,
because I've got a major scoop.</font>

149
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">In October, there was a free
Toni Braxton concert on the quad...</font>

150
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to remind me.</font>

151
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when a last-minute mix-up
shifted the showtime by an hour,</font>

152
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:45,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">an anonymous text message went
out alerting students of the change.</font>

153
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Not okay.</font>

154
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:49,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the text message was sent
exclusively to black students.</font>

155
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one French kid named Lebron.</font>

156
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's profiling.</font>

157
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:56,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is front page juice.
I gotta find out who sent the text.</font>

158
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you called
the number that sent it?</font>

159
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:02,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, nobody's that stupid, right?</font>

160
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:08,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

161
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

162
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong number.</font>

163
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. That was a good cover.</font>

164
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:24,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">So whoever it is keeps hanging up,
but he can't hide forever.</font>

165
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:27,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie the reporter. Good times.</font>

166
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up, I just want to say,
thank you guys real much...</font>

167
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real much? Duh.</font>

168
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you guys very much for this.</font>

169
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a dream come true.
Aww.</font>

170
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let's study some Spanish.</font>

171
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:47,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">So for the essay, we conjugate...
Conjugate?</font>

172
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conjugal. Visit.</font>

173
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:55,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha. Lame.
Okay, stick and move, stick and move.</font>

174
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so for the essay portion...</font>

175
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Annie got an essay portion ♪</font>

176
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Annie gonna move
Her luscious fanny all day long ♪♪</font>

177
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Buddy can sing, you guys.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

178
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's great.</font>

179
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:13,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's pretty young,
we try not to sexualize her.</font>

180
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Whoa!</font>

181
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look, I did... You know what?</font>

182
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your study group, and I don't know if you
perceive it as something that could be improved</font>

183
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do have some ideas.</font>

184
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's one right here. Boom.</font>

185
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking, we could start
saying, "You go, girl."</font>

186
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in a way that's, you know, oh,
I'm so cool saying, "You go, girl."</font>

187
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in a way that
we're kind of winking at it.</font>

188
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bottom line,
you guys need a chubby, agile guy.</font>

189
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,023
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Did anyone see
Paul Blart: Marl Car...</i></font>

190
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,529
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Paul Blart: Mall Cop.</i></font>

191
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:48,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like that, okay?
I'm fat and I'm physical, okay?</font>

192
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm strong, hmm,
and I can kick.</font>

193
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

194
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:54,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, sorry.</font>

195
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:56,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Jeff?
No, no, it's fine.</font>

196
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a little... Little nosebleed,
I get them when it's dry,</font>

197
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">or when my face gets kicked.</font>

198
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get some paper towels.</font>

199
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:11,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone say something about a
meeting to discuss member policy?</font>

200
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:17,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's obvious to everyone, that this
Buddy fellow has a few fruit loops loose</font>

201
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:21,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I think no matter what we do, we
gotta do it with grace and caution.</font>

202
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we keep Buddy in the group.
What?</font>

203
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've given it a lot of thought and
frankly I like his in-your-face style.</font>

204
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stop thinking
about his high kick.</font>

205
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">His ratio of girth
to hip flexibility is mesmerizing.</font>

206
00:10:33,953 --> 00:10:35,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like his idea of ironically
saying, "You go, girl."</font>

207
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go, girl.
You go, girl.</font>

208
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, so you kick high enough
and you get in the group?</font>

209
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're gonna add people, I really think
we should consider my friend Gary.</font>

210
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Shirley,
you friend Gary is so boring.</font>

211
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:49,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was raised in Finland,
he doesn't get our humor.</font>

212
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if we're gonna add a chair for every
bong-ripping, good-time charlie,</font>

213
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:56,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a song in his heart,
I move we institute hazing.</font>

the novel by Tom Wolfe...</i></font>

215
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:01,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why we need new blood.
I'm so bored of your pop culture references,</font>

216
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your cigarette-legged jeans.</font>

217
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Gary wears nothing
but loose-fitting jeans.</font>

218
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary is off the table.
He is a buzz kill.</font>

219
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">He grew up in a land without sun.</font>

220
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a vote.
They'd probably vote him in.</font>

221
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't.</font>

222
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys. Guys, let's take a vote.</font>

223
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secret vote,
everybody cover your eyes.</font>

224
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:26,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't know the result.
Say your vote out loud.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll know each ether's voices.
Troy's got a point.</font>

00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap. Wow.</font>

227
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:34,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says here, some guy in Seattle went nuts
and killed his entire driver's ed class</font>

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a meat tenderizer.</font>

229
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

230
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:39,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to be careful.</font>

231
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

232
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the count of three,</font>

233
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:47,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">everybody who wants to keep
Buddy out, raise your hand.</font>

234
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lied about the guy in Seattle
with the meat tenderizer.</font>

235
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:02,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put your thumb on the scale.</font>

236
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:05,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it with a smile and you
did it so you could keep smiling.</font>

237
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:07,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Hawkeye.</font>

238
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with Buddy gone,
staying that way will be a lot easier.</font>

239
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not racist.</font>

240
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:16,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had 20 minutes to let people know
Toni Braxton was starting early</font>

241
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">and 273 text messages left
before my rate tripled.</font>

242
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Racial profiling may not be right,
but it can be economical.</font>

243
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, dean, when I refer
to you in my article,</font>

244
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you prefer
imbecile or incompetent?</font>

245
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd prefer incompetent,
but what I really want...</font>

246
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:31,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter what you want.</font>

247
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people want the truth,
I have to give it to them,</font>

248
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I won't let anyone
stand in my way.</font>

249
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

250
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Hey, Jeffrey.</font>

251
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:44,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the least racist person
in the world.</font>

252
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">My best friend, when I was
6 years old, was a black man.</font>

253
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look. I've learned my lesson.
I've got unlimited texting now.</font>

254
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if she runs that story,</font>

255
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will lose this job,
and this job is my life.</font>

256
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:57,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">She listens to you.</font>

257
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:01,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, next time we're both
hanging out, having fun,</font>

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could try cracking wise
about it with her.</font>

259
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do what you think is right.</font>

260
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.
Okay.</font>

261
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying,
it's not exactly Watergate.</font>

262
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:24,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you like the dean,
he's trying to help you transfer.</font>

263
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:26,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and this time,
he might succeed.</font>

264
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:30,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this article breaks out, I can apply
for journalism scholarships.</font>

265
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:33,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody will care about my time
in rehab if they think I'm a writer.</font>

266
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:36,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, as your upbeat friend,
I gotta say, let this go.</font>

267
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:39,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Greendale, Jeff,

he was out?</font>

273
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we thought you would.</font>

274
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, my lady,
you missed my apology song.</font>

275
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,622

I'll tell them about it later.</font>

278
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">yesterday, the group took a vote.</font>

279
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you seem to have
figured out the rest of it.</font>

280
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it the high kick?</font>

281
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:26,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it, "You go, girl?"</font>

282
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys think you're so cool.</font>

283
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:31,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we don't think we're cool at all.
Just a bit.</font>

284
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put myself out there for you.</font>

285
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:36,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I laid my soul bare.</font>

286

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I baked with my own hands.</font>

288
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe a little less sugar next time.</font>

289
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:46,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm not leaving.</font>

290
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:48,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

291
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:51,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be relaxed, like me.</font>

292
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:53,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave.
You're not relaxed.</font>

293
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an uptight puppet master.
And these are your little puppets.</font>

294
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am no man's puppet, sir.</font>

295
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:00,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you.</font>

296
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy, just be reasonable and go.</font>

297
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me, Hitler.</font>

298
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:08,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Okay, so, uh,</font>

299
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:09,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">so since Buddy's not leaving,</font>

300
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:13,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll just be the person who we
wish wasn't here while we study.</font>

301
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try getting that deal from Hitler.</font>

302
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:17,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we?</font>

303
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:21,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm studying with you.
No, you're not.</font>

304
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone stop studying.
Okay.</font>

305
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not in the group.</font>

306
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then go study
somewhere else.</font>

307
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:54,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

308
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

309
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I wanna study with you guys.</font>

310
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

311
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

312
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you.</font>

313
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate your study group. I hate it.</font>

314
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suck.</font>

315
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:20,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you.</font>

316
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are not running that story.
Why not?</font>

317
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I said so.</font>

318
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:31,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody have a problem
with how that was handled?</font>

319
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
Exactly the way I would've done it.</font>

320
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suck.</font>

321
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you kidding, Abed?</font>

322
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just dragged
a screaming, crying man</font>

323
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of a library
with his pants down.</font>

324
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Martinis are for Hawkeyes.</font>

325
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the same uptight jerk
I was last semester.</font>

326
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,531
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff, what's your favorite episode
of M* A*S*H?</i></font>

327
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one with, uh, the Army.</font>

328
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I thought.</font>

329
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:08,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had actually
seen the show</font>

330
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd know that Hawkeye didn't just
bed nurses and drink martinis.</font>

331
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:14,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">He also had blood sprayed on his face and
barked orders when the choppers came in.</font>

332
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:16,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he didn't, people died.</font>

333
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a leader, Jeff.
That's your job.</font>

334
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? What's in it for me?</font>

335
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Annie.</font>

336
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I'm sorry that I yelled.</font>

337
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you did.</font>

338
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:34,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't even really occur to me what I
was doing until I saw how upset you were.</font>

339
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:37,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never want to be the reason
you're mad, because</font>

340
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're Jeff Winger.</font>

341
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:43,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">So thanks</font>

342
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:46,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">for getting mad.</font>

343
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was nothing.</font>

344
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that's the upside, isn't it?</font>

345
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you,</font>

346
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radar.</font>

347
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:07,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. You made me so happy
I just peed a little.</font>

348
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:10,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think violence is the answer
when we make decisions.</font>

349
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, guys.
Hi, Buddy.</font>

350
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:18,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you, um?
Excuse us?</font>

351
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">For one crazy stalker?</font>

352
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up,
we outnumber this guy six to one.</font>

353
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, you flash your breasts
as a decoy for the bumrush.</font>

354
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:35,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?
Britta, don't be upset.</font>

355
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't pick you as a decoy
because your breasts are so old.</font>

356
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is he even here? Hello.</font>

357
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invited him.</font>

358
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:47,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy's crime
is thinking we're cool.</font>

359
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I get it.</font>

360
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if I were him,
and I missed out on you guys,</font>

361
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be sitting in that classroom,
watching, wondering.</font>

362
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:03,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how can I exclude someone from
something that I'm so lucky to have.</font>

363
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

364
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we let him in.</font>

365
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Buddy.</font>

366
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the group.</font>

367
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes.</font>

368
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:19,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not regret this.</font>

369
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

370
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Buddy, the group
thought about what you said.</font>

371
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took a vote. And you're in.</font>

372
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way. I'm in the cool group?</font>

373
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like Christmas morning
for the guy.</font>

374
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome.</font>

375
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is...</font>

376
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is awkward.</font>

377
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys were my safety. Pfft.</font>

378
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, Buddy, you don't have
to worry about them.</font>

379
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:52,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're with us now. Come on.</font>

380
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha! Boo!</font>

381
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's amazing.
I love the kicks. The kicks are the best.</font>

382
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why I voted to keep him.</font>

383
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:13,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would have been nice to have
another person in the group.</font>

384
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:14,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call Gary.</font>

385
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it says here
you want to join as a twosome?</font>

386
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see that as a selling point.</font>

387
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:28,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">We work really well together.
Yeah.</font>

388
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me hear that rap thing
of yours again.</font>

389
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'm gonna talk it over
with the others.</font>

390
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:39,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, thanks for your time.
You traitors.</font>

391
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:43,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am appalled at your lack of loyalty.</font>

392
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:48,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you better run.</font>

393
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:51,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you decided?
We saw your tape.</font>

394
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're passing.
I don't pop on video.</font>

395
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me do the song in person.</font>

396
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Getting rid of Britta ♪</font>

397
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Getting rid of the B ♪</font>

398
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ She's a GDB ♪</font>

399
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:04,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ She's a no-good B ♪♪</font>
