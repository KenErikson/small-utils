00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man. My name is Jeff.</font>

2
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:21,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to lock down the rest
of my schedule before the deadline.</font>

3
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard this class was a cakewalk.
Are you passing it?</font>

4
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:27,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like Dane Cook?
Yeah, he's awesome.</font>

5
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far so good.</font>

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,975
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Death, so called</i></font>

7
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:38,135
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Is a thing that makes men weep</i></font>

8
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:44,013
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And yet a third of life
is spent in sleep.</i></font>

9
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your text books to page 37.</font>

10
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now close them
and throw them away.</font>

11
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:58,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw it away. Ha-ha-ha.</font>

12
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw it away.</font>

13
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">For those who are new,
the motto of this class,</font>

14
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:07,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">carpe diem, seize the day,
no tests, no papers.</font>

15
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:09,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want an A?</font>

16
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Live in</font>

17
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">the moment.</font>

18
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:17,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackpot.</font>

19
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your shoes.
Quick, take off your shoes.</font>

20
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, take your shoes off,
throw them away.</font>

21
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw them across the room
over there.</font>

22
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we learn to walk,
get up and walk out the door.</font>

23
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:28,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">This day could be your last.</font>

24
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could die in your sleep.
You could get hit by a bus.</font>

25
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:34,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, that mole is raised and dark,
it's not a good combo.</font>

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are new.
Yes, I'm new, but I'll be old too soon.</font>

27
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carpe diem, sir, carpe diem.</font>

28
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it!</font>

29
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice command.</font>

30
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice command.</font>

31
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice command.</font>

32
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:51,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice command.</font>

33
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice command.</font>

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voice comm...</font>

35
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please use the buttons?</font>

36
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, grandpa.</font>

37
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Achoo!
Oh. God bless you, dear.</font>

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so funny?
You guys, I found it.</font>

39
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ultimate blow-off class.</font>

40
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Professor Whitman, he thinks he's
in Dead Poets Society.</i></font>

41
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no tests, there's no work,
it's just day seizing.</font>

42
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:26,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">The deadline to enroll is tomorrow.
I suggest you all do it.</font>

43
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, some of us are here
to actually learn things.</font>

44
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.
Me too, it sounds educational.</font>

45
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it, I love Robin Williams.
Abed?</font>

46
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a fan. In every movie,
there's an authority figure</font>

47
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:37,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">that gets mad at him
for making people laugh.</font>

48
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, are you going to take the class?
Oh, can't.</font>

49
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad will only pay for classes that
will help me run the family restaurant.</font>

50
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been struggling since 2001, 9/11 was
pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.</font>

51
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">So your dad has your whole life
planned out for you?</font>

52
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:54,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you even interested in falafel?
I'm interested in making movies.</font>

53
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:57,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my Dad says all media's western
propaganda that negatively stereotypes Arabs.</font>

54
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then he should see Aladdin,
Jafar was a badass.</i></font>

55
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he was.
Yeah.</font>

56
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:02,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was.</font>

57
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed,
how much does a film class cost?</font>

58
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:06,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seventy dollars.</font>

59
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?
Jeff?</font>

60
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:15,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.
Isn't Abed's dad a hardcore Muslim?</font>

61
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not as understanding
as Christians.</font>

62
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could get your head cut off
with a salami sword.</font>

63
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:22,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, that's the most racist thing
I've ever heard.</font>

64
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:24,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce will beat that in one minute.</font>

65
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really nice of you.</font>

66
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">The memo says, "For dreams."
Aw.</font>

67
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys,
are we going to study Spanish,</font>

68
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">or keep getting involved
in each other's personal lives?</font>

69
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Achoo!
Hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.</font>

70
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about I pound you like a boy?
That didn't come out right.</font>

71
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you leave him alone
with his cute baby sneezes.</font>

72
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not my mother.
She's not?</font>

73
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty-nine seconds.</font>

74
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?
My name is Shirley Bennett.</font>

75
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, you get an A, Oh.</font>

76
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can tell me
why you are here at Greendale.</font>

77
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you?</font>

78
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but, uh, never again.</font>

79
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:34,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley?</font>

80
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:37,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get a degree in business
so I can sell my baked goods</font>

81
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">and whatnot on the Internet.</font>

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

83
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get a degree in business so I can sell
my baked goods and whatnot on the Internet.</font>

84
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

85
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I wasted 15 years
of my life</font>

86
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a man who left me
with nothing but stretch marks</font>

87
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a foggy memory
of two bland orgasms.</font>

88
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now it's time to get
what's mine.</font>

89
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Day seized.</font>

90
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:06,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only when we stop stopping our lives
can we begin to start starting them.</font>

91
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Edison here, for example,</font>

92
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:11,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">would rather write what happens
to other people than live</font>

93
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is happening to her.</font>

94
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought there might be a quiz.
Well, here's a quiz for you.</font>

95
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:19,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did the pretty young girl
die alone,</font>

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">surrounded
by sweater-wearing cats</font>

97
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:23,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">who were trained
to use human toilets?</font>

98
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up on your desk.</font>

99
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:31,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, stand on your desk.</font>

100
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up on your desk.</font>

101
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">She made it. Ha-ha.</font>

102
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, stand on your desks.</font>

103
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up, up, up. Come on.</font>

104
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:42,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise, rise,
rise above the programming.</font>

105
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">All your lives you were told
don't stand on your desk.</font>

106
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:47,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why not?</font>

107
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's okay, go to the nurse,
seize the day.</font>

108
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:57,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I was very moved
by your honesty earlier.</font>

109
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Particularly the part about,
uh, your husband not being...</font>

110
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:04,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your homework. Ah.</font>

111
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:05,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

112
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to swim in a lake and
tell 10 people that you love them.</font>

113
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:13,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger,
may I have a word, please?</font>

114
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:16,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?
Oh. Oh, maybe, I'm not.</font>

115
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:20,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mr. Winger,
I like to think that every life</font>

116
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">that passes through this class
is changed.</font>

117
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:25,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">But every year, there's
always one cocky opportunist</font>

118
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's just here to coast
and grab an easy A.</font>

119
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:29,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

120
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Pierce,
I can talk to him for you.</font>

121
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's actually you, Mr. Winger.</font>

122
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:36,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no intention
of seizing the day.</font>

123
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Listen, l...
I have never lived until I met you.</font>

124
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I love you.
There's one down, nine to go.</font>

125
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:47,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I need the grade
or even want it.</font>

126
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:50,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, glad to hear it, because
if you don't genuinely seize the day</font>

127
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the end of the week,</font>

128
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you will be seizing an F
for the semester.</font>

129
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:00,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no way to teach accounting.</font>

130
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:05,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to plan in advance how to
prove that I live in the moment.</font>

131
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:08,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather take an actual class,
but now it's too late to drop or add.</font>

132
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:12,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not fair how hard it is
for you to cheat here.</font>

133
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:16,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah! Hey, how's it going?
How's your film class, buddy?</font>

134
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:18,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool. Our first
assignment is a documentary.</font>

135
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:20,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like real movies
but with ugly people.</font>

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm learning a lot.
That is so wonderful.</font>

137
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:25,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people don't like getting involved
in others' lives. I think it's great.</font>

138
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:29,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, if you're making a documentary about
Britta patting herself on the back,</font>

139
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:30,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna need
a backup battery.</font>

140
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually,
I'm doing a movie about my dad.</font>

141
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is brilliant. How did he react
to you signing up for the film class?</font>

142
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">That part hasn't happened yet.
Here he comes.</font>

143
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you want to get involved
in my family's business?</font>

144
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy war.</font>

145
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do I find Mr. Britta?</font>

146
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:46,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Mr. Britta.</font>

147
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right,
I'm a woman with rights.</font>

148
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can see my whole face.</font>

149
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I get it, because I'm Arab
I must hate women.</font>

150
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you something.
I love women.</font>

151
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:00,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm getting a major B-word vibe
from you.</font>

152
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, I can't believe I missed out
on getting involved in this.</font>

153
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,734
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You go host American Idol,
and you stop messing with my son.</i></font>

154
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a special boy.</font>

155
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I raise him. You don't.
Raising him</font>

156
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:13,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">means letting him follow dreams.
Dreams are for sleeping.</font>

157
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know that.
It's clinically proven.</font>

158
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is polio.
You lost me.</font>

159
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:20,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed wants to study film.</font>

160
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he saying?
He says we're leaving.</font>

161
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him you wanna stay
and study film.</font>

162
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:28,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'm really in the scene.
See?</font>

163
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to talk to him before,
now we have this between us.</font>

164
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.
Hey. Hey.</font>

165
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.</font>

166
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You don't touch me.
Stop.</font>

167
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, you have a right to your faith
and your family's privacy</font>

168
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:44,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Abed is an adult
and a U.S. citizen.</font>

169
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?
Yeah.</font>

170
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he has the right to stay.</font>

171
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

172
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to raise him?
You raise him, I'm out.</font>

173
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?
You know, I had a father like you.</font>

174
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the day
I finally cut myself loose</font>

175
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:04,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the day
I finally started being happy.</font>

176
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">That went well.</font>

177
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to make some adjustments
to my film.</font>

178
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I think you should play
the role of my father.</font>

179
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be your father.
It's perfect,</font>

180
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">you already know your lines.</font>

181
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:24,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you dressed
like an '80s rapist?</font>

182
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:27,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Whitman
comes by here every morning</font>

183
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I need him to see me
celebrating life.</font>

184
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's all that?
I am calculating Abed's expenses.</font>

185
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:38,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there's books, there's
meals, he's renting that camera.</font>

186
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs a little spending money.
Um... All money is spending money.</font>

187
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Um, Britta, it's amazing
what you're doing for Abed.</font>

188
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean a lot of people
talk a good game, but you,</font>

189
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">you follow through.</font>

190
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

191
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:54,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, thank you.
Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.</font>

192
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happened yesterday.
Shirley's just doing her homework.</font>

193
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:59,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hillary,
thank you for getting people coffee.</font>

194
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

195
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:07,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, how's it going, buddy?
Good, my film is coming together.</font>

196
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool tie, Jeff, are you wearing that
because you're playing the role of my dad,</font>

197
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">or is it really Christmas?</font>

198
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely Christmas.
Is that a new camera?</font>

199
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's more expensive but it lets
me adjust really specific settings</font>

200
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">that most people don't notice
or think about.</font>

201
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:22,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I would like a latte,
and Jeff, let me get you something.</font>

202
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay.
Oh, come on, I got you.</font>

203
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, really, I don't need anything...
No, really. You're insulting me.</font>

204
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:31,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at all this cash.
Okay. I will get a small, black coffee.</font>

205
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo. An ordinary coffee
for an ordinary life.</font>

206
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:38,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, Professor Whitman.</font>

207
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Mr. Winger,
these won't cut it.</font>

208
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Shazbat.
I shall have...</i></font>

209
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">A birthday cake.</font>

210
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen men in your situation,
Troy.</font>

211
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, those are both for me.</font>

212
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:08,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were on top of the world before
and now no one gives a rat's ass.</font>

213
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can help you with your image.</font>

214
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:13,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, I'd lose the jacket,
you look like a high school bitch.</font>

215
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">But more importantly,
it's your sneeze.</font>

216
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:20,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a CEO,
I had an array of masculine sneezes</font>

217
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">that asserted dominance.</font>

218
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:26,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the explosive
shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze.</font>

219
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, the draw them in sneeze,
you know.</font>

220
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, maybe I wouldn't sneeze,
because I'm in control.</font>

221
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:43,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can even use a sneeze
to drive home a point.</font>

222
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:46,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, I think the Cubs
are gonna win it all this year.</font>

223
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

224
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me more.</font>

225
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:05,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's show time.</font>

226
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everybody, good morning.</font>

227
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:14,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Greendale.</font>

228
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:16,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, good morning.</font>

229
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:18,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch the kite. Uh-oh.</font>

230
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:20,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I get a chance? Oh!</font>

231
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, you guys, bring it in here.
Nice.</font>

232
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much, you guys,
that was really fun.</font>

233
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sloppy.</font>

234
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Considering the age of these girls,
unwittingly creepy.</font>

235
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

236
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:44,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beat it. Professor. Will you look at the
amount of work that I'm putting into this?</font>

237
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, throw me a bone.</font>

238
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:49,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had I not already cried
at the sunrise this morning,</font>

239
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would be weeping right now.</font>

240
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:55,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?
What do you mean, Jeff?</font>

241
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:57,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does your life mean?</font>

242
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it take you
in the morning</font>

243
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:00,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make it look like
you have bed-head?</font>

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many sweatpants-
sports jacket combos</font>

245
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:06,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">did you try before you found
the one that said, "I don't care?"</font>

246
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seize the day, Jeff. For real.</font>

247
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:13,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go running naked in a hail storm.
Kiss a girl in the middle of the day.</font>

248
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fly a kite, but do it for yourself.</font>

249
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:18,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you won't just fail my class,</font>

250
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll fail life.</font>

251
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

252
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's really got your number.
Drop the flower.</font>

253
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to talk to you about Abed.</font>

254
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went by his film class today,
he wasn't there, he's cutting.</font>

255
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know why
he would do something like that.</font>

256
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask him.
Every time I try to ask him about it,</font>

257
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:44,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">he just keeps filming me</font>

258
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">and telling me that I'm playing
the role of his mother.</font>

259
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed is not normal.</font>

260
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:51,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you bought</font>

261
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:54,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you intentionally
tangled yourself in his life.</font>

262
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:57,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, will you just...
Will you please talk to him?</font>

263
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:00,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got problems of my own.
I'm out here trying to seize a day.</font>

264
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:06,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the hell?</font>

265
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he gonna kill us?</font>

266
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the pizza, Abed,
I was starving.</font>

267
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:19,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's nice, like a picnic.
Or a family dinner.</font>

268
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a study group and a pizza,
let's not get carried away.</font>

269
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Abed.</font>

270
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's film class?
Good.</font>

271
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Did you go to class today?
Not really.</font>

272
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:38,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really. Well,
Britta's paying for those classes,</font>

273
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:40,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you think
maybe you should go?</font>

274
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was shooting my movie.
Your movie is for class.</font>

275
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:46,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">My movie's more important.
La-la-la.</font>

276
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone order seven lattes?
I got that.</font>

277
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, You don't got it.
I got it, Abed.</font>

278
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got everything.</font>

279
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong with you,
all I want to do is take care of you.</font>

280
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're not stupid,
are you doing this on purpose?</font>

281
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:06,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't you answer me?
This is the scene where you leave.</font>

282
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:10,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better believe it.
Britta.</font>

283
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:19,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think, Dad?
I think you are really weird, Abed.</font>

284
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think
the wrong person just left.</font>

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect. That's a wrap.</font>

286
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:33,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy was your dad?</font>

287
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Hey.</font>

288
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't really have tickets
for Ravi Shankar, do you?</font>

289
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied to get you here
because it's time to communicate.</font>

290
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Communicate?
Have you met Abed?</font>

291
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the two of you
that need to talk.</font>

292
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:51,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait a minute,</font>

293
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">where's Weezer?
They're coming.</font>

294
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Now, the only reason
why this whole mess got started</font>

295
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:58,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">is because both of you
wanted the best for Abed.</font>

296
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think the lesson
we can all take away from this</font>

297
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that everyone should always do
whatever they want,</font>

298
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:07,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">and leave each other out of it.</font>

299
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your take?
Let me give you mine.</font>

300
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend
got all up in my stuff</font>

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you wanted to be cowboys,
and then you turned chicken</font>

302
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you found out it would
take more than speeches</font>

303
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">and guided missiles.</font>

304
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting,
I hadn't seen the Iraq metaphor.</font>

305
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Iraq metaphor? I'm talking about
your speeches and her guided...</font>

306
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:31,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it. The point is,
is that Britta is sorry, right?</font>

307
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:32,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong.
Crap.</font>

308
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed may not be
a great filmmaker</font>

309
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that doesn't mean
that he wants to make falafel.</font>

310
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to let him
make his own decisions.</font>

311
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make his own decisions?
Have you met Abed? You know who he is?</font>

312
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no...
Guys.</font>

313
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're stupid.
I'm finished.</font>

314
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, Jeff, Dad.</font>

315
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad.</font>

316
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,092
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How's it going, buddy?
I don't want to be your father.</i></font>

317
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,260
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I think you are weird, Abed.</i></font>

318
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,595
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hey, look.
I need to talk to you about Abed.</i></font>

319
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,202
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He's not normal.</i></font>

320
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:33,467
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What is wrong with you?
All I want to do is take care of you.</i></font>

321
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:36,876
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why will you not answer me?</i></font>

322
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,816
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What do you think, dad?</i></font>

323
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,220
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I think you are weird, Abed.</i></font>

324
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,296
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I think
the wrong person just left.</i></font>

325
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's not exactly Citizen Kane.</i></font>

326
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel a little out of the loop here.</font>

327
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">That feeling is
called the joy of freedom.</font>

328
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son is hard to understand.</font>

329
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:44,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">If making movies help him
be understood,</font>

330
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I pay for the class.</font>

331
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,019
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I made this all happen.</i></font>

332
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">With falafel as a fallback.</font>

333
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Yeah?</font>

334
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you do all of that to me
on purpose?</font>

335
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:11,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a very nice way
to treat your friends.</font>

336
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Britta,
it isn't called friend business,</font>

337
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:17,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's called show business.</font>

338
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's smoking.
Honey, let him leave the nest.</font>

339
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your hand off of my knee.</font>

340
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:35,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">God... God bless you.</font>

341
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">God bless you.
Thank you.</font>

342
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">For someone who doesn't
like getting involved, well,</font>

343
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you.</font>

344
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">You owe me?</font>

345
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">That can not be comfortable for you.</font>

346
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:52,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, um...</font>

347
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:55,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should kiss me right now.</font>

348
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Day seized!</font>

349
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're even.
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

350
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">A plus, Winger.</font>

351
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:14,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a life-changing kiss
when I see one. Wowee!</font>

352
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:20,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

353
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:22,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fooled you.</font>

354
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I krumping?
No.</font>

355
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I krumping? Am I krumping?
No. No.</font>

356
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I krumping now?</font>

357
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

358
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is krumping.</font>

359
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">We... We're krumping.
No, you're not.</font>
