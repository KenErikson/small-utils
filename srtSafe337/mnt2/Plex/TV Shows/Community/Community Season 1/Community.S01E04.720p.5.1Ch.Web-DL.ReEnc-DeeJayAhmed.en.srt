00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we wrap up,
I would like to thank you guys</font>

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">for filling out these
anonymous evaluation cards.</font>

3
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:10,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found your feedback to be
largely constructive and flattering.</font>

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:12,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, gracias Abed.
- De nada.</font>

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:13,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to sign
your name anymore.</font>

6
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:22,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there was one evaluation
that was so harsh, and hurtful, and racist...</font>

8
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:28,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I took the time personally to analyze
that handwriting against past exams.</font>

9
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:32,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this particular coward...</font>

10
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:38,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">dots her I's with tiny,
itty-bitty, little circles.</font>

11
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:41,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boop. Boop.</font>

12
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:44,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that precious and cute?</font>

13
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's erratic and unstable
now, princess gringa?</font>

14
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:57,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice day out today, isn't it?
- Yeah. Shoot!</font>

15
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You forget something?
- Yeah.</font>

16
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot to stagger the timing
of my exit with Shirley's.</font>

17
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:06,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both have a class
across campus, and I can't go</font>

18
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">that kind of distance
with "ooh, that's nice."</font>

19
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's mean.
- No. That's not nice.</font>

20
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find Shirley very easy to talk to.</font>

21
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:17,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And besides, aren't you supposed to have,
like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-jabber?</font>

22
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:19,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I'm a sprinter.</font>

23
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm at my best during
high-speed bursts of wit.</font>

24
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a Shirley walk, I'd be winded
by that stoner tree.</font>

25
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:27,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Britta. Hi!
What's up?</font>

26
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Vaughn, how's it going?
- No worries.</font>

27
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:33,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting. 'Cause I might be worried if I
was playing hacky sack a decade too late.</font>

28
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My class is that way.
- All right.</font>

29
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I just wanted to point out that
we easily walked more than 100 yards</font>

30
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:42,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no awkward pauses. And
that is the sign of a true friend, so...</font>

31
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really glad that you're
not hitting on me anymore.</font>

32
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's the awkward pause.</font>

33
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sync, corrected by vNaru</font>

34
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me! Oh, sorry, ladies.</font>

35
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Duncan!
Professor Duncan!</font>

36
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:00,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry.</font>

37
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie Edison. I'm in your 101 lecture.
- Hello.</font>

38
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard about your special psych lab.</font>

39
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:06,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Duncan Principle.
- Yes.</font>

40
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know it's limited
to second-year students,</font>

41
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I had a 4.0 at Riverside High,
and I'm not looking down</font>

42
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they actually made me lose
my scholarship and virginity.</font>

43
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- If you would let me take your lab early,</font>

44
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would be a real feather
in my transcript.</font>

45
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I've actually been
in this situation many times,</font>

46
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm just going to be up front.</font>

47
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not allowed to date students.</font>

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though you're an eight.</font>

49
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:35,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is a British ten, so I'm angry.</font>

50
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if, in spite of that,
you are still interested,</font>

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you may join the lab.</font>

52
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:43,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You need to bring
two human subjects.</font>

53
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it would not hurt your chances one
bit if you could lend me a fiver.</font>

54
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:51,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seem to have left my purse in my duffle
and my duffle in the boot of my lorry, so...</font>

55
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked politely, and then
panda took his pants off...</font>

56
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never even knew
that's what asexual meant.</font>

57
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder what this
express package could be?</font>

58
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody had to get
something to me very fast.</font>

59
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought your mail to campus?</font>

60
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. My ear-noculars.</font>

61
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:10,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? It looks like
your bluetooth thingie.</font>

62
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no.
This is my cell phone headset.</font>

63
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:18,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is 'ear-noculars'.</font>

64
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for spies and whatnot.
It gives you sonic hearing.</font>

65
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All hearing is sonic.
- What's that?</font>

66
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, who wants to be
in a psych experiment?</font>

67
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, guys, guys?</font>

68
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:30,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie is talking about
some kind of experiment.</font>

69
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:33,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's behind you.
Not interested.</font>

70
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please? You get paid.</font>

71
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do they do stuff to your butt?
- No.</font>

72
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you get paid more if they
do stuff to your butt?</font>

73
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- That's fine, I'll do it. I'm in.</font>

74
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you, Abed?
It's tomorrow.</font>

75
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow? They're showing all four
Indiana Jones at the vista.</font>

76
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really looking forward
to the first three. I bought a whip.</font>

77
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:54,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really important to me, Abed.</font>

78
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:56,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please go as my friend?</font>

79
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">My really good friend?</font>

80
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't realize we were
really good friends.</font>

81
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured we were more
like Chandler and Phoebe.</font>

82
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never really
had stories together.</font>

83
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, I'll do it, Chandler.</font>

84
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Abed.</font>

85
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go save Britta
from that dude.</font>

86
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.</font>

87
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope he doesn't try to
"handsome" her to death.</font>

88
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And panda has no pants.
- Hey.</font>

89
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hi, what's up, man? I'm Vaughn.</font>

90
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You in line?
- Oh, no, no, no.</font>

91
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:22,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just, uh,
we're just chillin'.</font>

92
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you're not gonna
order coffee?</font>

93
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I was just gonna see if Britta...
- I mean, no judgment, bro. I used to do coffee.</font>

94
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I made the switch
to green tea. It's, like...</font>

95
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like filled with these
antioxidants and stuff.</font>

96
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's pretty tight.
- Tight, yes!</font>

97
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard that about green tea.</font>

98
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like green tea. I should make the change.</font>

99
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up top, sugar bear.</font>

100
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:44,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, give me some of that.
- There it is.</font>

101
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small coffee, please.</font>

102
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's making the change to green tea.</font>

103
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's good.
It's good for your skin.</font>

104
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:53,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, research assistants.</font>

105
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you turn your attention to the
monitor, you will see that our subjects</font>

106
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">are waiting for the
experiment to begin. But...</font>

107
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:03,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's actually happening right now.</font>

108
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, the waiting is the experiment.</font>

109
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:11,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Duncan Principle is simple.</font>

110
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Namely, that the more control
lost by the...</font>

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">yeah, I'm gonna write this down
too, actually. That's a good point.</font>

112
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more control lost by the ego,
the more gained by the id,</font>

113
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:28,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">resulting in a surprisingly predictable,
emotional eruption or breaking point.</font>

114
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:32,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Known to Ma and Pa as
a good old-fashioned tantrum.</font>

115
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:39,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, why don't you, uh,
go and tell our subjects</font>

116
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we're going to be starting the
experiment in five minutes, okay?</font>

117
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:46,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Annie...</font>

118
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never actually
going to start.</font>

119
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this.</font>

120
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, everyone.</font>

121
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Troy.</font>

122
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Abed.</font>

123
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, señor Chang.</font>

124
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:06,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, a Community College
Spanish teacher can't use 80 bucks?</font>

125
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're just running
a little bit behind,</font>

126
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:13,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">- so we'll probably start
in about five minutes. - No!</font>

127
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:16,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!</font>

128
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unacceptable, all right?
You lied to me!</font>

129
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:24,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you say something
starts at nine, it starts at nueve!</font>

130
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- Houston, we have an idiot.</font>

132
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:48,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know we walk
the same way after class?</font>

133
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you didn't or else we
would've been walking together.</font>

134
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:51,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you're a jerk.</font>

135
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kidding.</font>

136
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:54,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do it.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

137
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go too fast for
these dogs. Short legs.</font>

138
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, how do you like...?
- You've got a kid, right?</font>

139
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- Nothing.</font>

140
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Pierce isn't exactly
right in the head, is he?</font>

141
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:17,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a lot of grown men with radar
dishes coming out of their ear.</font>

142
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's like inspector gadget.
- Yeah, go, go, gadget incontinence.</font>

143
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how about that guy that's always
around, flirting with Britta?</font>

144
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:26,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know! He's the worst! Vaughn?
- I know, and what is it with his hair?</font>

145
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:27,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's perpetually moist.</font>

146
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:30,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're three hours in,
so let's review what we've seen.</font>

147
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:33,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">And pay close attention to
every subject's breaking point.</font>

148
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:37,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got... a shouter.
That one's a stomper.</font>

149
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, hippie.</font>

150
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:43,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a generic whack job, bouncing
up and down like a six-foot child.</font>

151
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shaking. Write that down.</font>

152
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Visible shakes.</font>

153
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:48,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, look at the little one
chase the big one.</font>

154
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him go. I'm gonna make him
go quicker. It's like benny hill looks.</font>

155
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back
again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him.</font>

156
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?
There's a bit of fun.</font>

157
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">It lightens the mood.
And back to the present...</font>

158
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, there were two.</font>

159
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break... Break...</font>

160
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no! Annie!</font>

161
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on in there?</font>

162
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why...? What is taking so long?</font>

163
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:28,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've wasted all day here, for you.</font>

164
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:32,157
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The soul train awards
were tonight.</i></font>

165
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised butt stuff!</font>

166
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... he's out. We got him.</font>

167
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Strike three, you're gone.
- There's so much dust in here!</font>

168
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what?</font>

169
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">The longer they wait,
the harder they break.</font>

170
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:54,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckle up, students.</font>

171
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see how often
hacky sack takes his shirt off?</font>

172
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd play shirts and skins
in a game of checkers.</font>

173
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad to be able
to talk to someone about this.</font>

174
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to say
something to britta about it,</font>

175
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're supposed to be friends now,
and she'd think I was jealous.</font>

176
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see why you
and Britta aren't together.</font>

177
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two cute white people going
to school together. Just seems right.</font>

178
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.</font>

179
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh, dear.</font>

180
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not what I want to see.</font>

181
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there goes the shirt.</font>

182
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:38,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

183
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:40,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm fine.</font>

184
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want me to, uh...</font>

185
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want me to check you
for grass stains?</font>

186
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure how or when to bring up
that I was hanging out with Vaughn.</font>

187
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:50,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured that you'd
make fun of him... and me.</font>

188
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:53,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, first of all, friends do
not make fun of each other,</font>

189
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:57,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if they're being tackled
in the quad by a hippie.</font>

190
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:02,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">And secondly, Vaughn seems cool.</font>

191
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you guys should
hang out sometime.</font>

192
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:10,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go. I... uh, that
was tacky out there.</font>

193
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You won't ever see that again.
- Oh, no worries, brah.</font>

194
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:25,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, did you see
Señor Chang's socks today?</font>

195
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiny bullfighters.</font>

196
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can top that. Did you see that
<i>hacky sack</i> wears an anklet?</font>

197
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:35,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when won't you
talk about Vaughn?</font>

198
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm trying to be
a good friend to Britta.</font>

199
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:42,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">She thought I was gonna make fun of
him, but I want to be unpredictable.</font>

200
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:47,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna show her that I'm not
the jerk she thinks I am, and...</font>

201
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:51,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">friend the hell out of that
green-tea-drinking drum circler.</font>

202
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but tell me you've noticed
how small his nipples are.</font>

203
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not engaging.
- What? It's not gossip when it's fact.</font>

204
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My kids have got hamsters
with bigger nips. - No!</font>

205
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:01,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, well. Jeff!
- No!</font>

206
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:11,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it on pause?
- No, that's just him.</font>

207
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:19,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry you've been waiting 26... hours.</font>

208
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just gonna be
another five minutes.</font>

209
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okey-dokey.</font>

210
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my...</font>

211
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't he leave?</font>

212
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor.
- What?</font>

213
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but this guy's not moving.</font>

214
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have classes to go to.</font>

215
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:38,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Fine!
Go kill John Lennon again, you loser.</font>

216
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's ruined my study.</font>

217
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has... He has warped
the Duncan Principle.</font>

218
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:48,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn you, you outlying piece of datum!</font>

219
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you!
It's your fault!</font>

220
00:11:56,786 --> 00:12:00,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you told me to bring subjects.
- Yeah, subjects! Not Rain Man!</font>

221
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:05,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should never have let you into this lab,
miss Annie fanny panties in a bunch!</font>

222
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's so hilarious!</font>

223
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think of that the last time
you skipped a trip to the dentist?</font>

224
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me answer that
question with another question.</font>

225
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:21,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not fair! It's not fair!</font>

226
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, why, why?</font>

227
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

228
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put... Stop writing!</font>

229
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your pen...!
Give me that!</font>

230
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!
Get out, you dorks!</font>

231
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!</font>

232
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:38,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have destroyed
the Duncan Principle!</font>

233
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:45,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go home!</font>

234
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

235
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:54,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">See ya!</font>

236
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:57,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, Britta said that you did
a lot of community service.</font>

237
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:01,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultimate frisbee at the Senior's
center. It is amazing.</font>

238
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what makes frisbee ultimate?</font>

239
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had a nickel for every time I wished
somebody asked me that.</font>

240
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get dessert.
Want anything?</font>

241
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:10,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carrots.</font>

242
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:12,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm good.</font>

243
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, you two.
- Hey.</font>

244
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:18,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a cool shirt.</font>

245
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Thank you very much.</font>

246
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:23,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's it from?
- Oh, uh, I don't even know.</font>

247
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,325

00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.</font>

250
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, people
underestimate the elderly.</font>

251
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, but you
see these guys out there</font>

252
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:37,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're throwing the bee,
and they're just loving life.</font>

253
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:40,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's just inspiring.
- You know, I'm gonna really...</font>

254
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna think about it.
- All right. I'm gonna go check on Britts.</font>

255
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See ya.
- See ya.</font>

256
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,823

<font color="#FFFFFF">You like Vaughn, right?</font>

262
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, he's very cute.
- I'm just worried</font>

263
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he's thinking
a little bit more intensely</font>

264
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:11,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">about this thing than I am.</font>

265
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says stuff, you know, after...</font>

266
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:16,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">School?</font>

267
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After...
- Dinner mints?</font>

268
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:21,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After...
- Not having sex?</font>

269
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How was that?
- What? Forget that.</font>

270
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem right now
is that he's calling me "babe",</font>

271
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's trying to hold my hand.</font>

272
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting a little relationship-y.</font>

273
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he gave me something.</font>

274

<font color="#FFFFFF">Herpes?</font>

275
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. This.</font>

to something like that?</font>

278
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:50,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's a very good question. And
it's one I will answer. Uh...</font>

279
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm getting a text. I'm just gonna
read it, if you don't mind.</font>

287
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:21,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the stain of a teardrop
over the word "rad."</font>

288
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:22,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he said "rad"?
I thought he said "bad."</font>

289
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:24,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that makes it worse.</font>

290
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm surprised he can read. You know?
- I know.</font>

291
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sorry about bailing
on the psych experiment.</font>

292
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the experiment, Troy.</font>

293
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were testing to see how long
people would wait in the room.</font>

294
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gotcha.</font>

295
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Gotcha"? That's all you have to say?
- Yeah.</font>

296
00:15:43,598 --> 00:15:49,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sat in a room for 26 straight
hours. Didn't that bother you?</font>

297
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I was livid.
- Then why didn't you leave?</font>

298
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you asked me to stay
and you said we were friends.</font>

299
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Is this still
part of the experiment?</font>

300
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's more like a puppy
with a fish mouth.</font>

301
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right, it's more like this.</font>

302
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Laugh it up.</font>

303
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys want to know
what they're doing?</font>

304
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Sure.</font>

305
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making fun of all of us.</font>

306
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you with my own
ear... noculars.</font>

307
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:23,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, we are not making fun of you.
- Ah-hah. Calling me "hacky sack",</font>

308
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ripping my six pack abs
and my moist hair.</font>

309
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that face you made?</font>

310
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think it's pretty obviously, Annie.</font>

311
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this is definitely still
part of the experiment.</font>

312
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, we were not
making fun of you. - Yeah.</font>

313
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're making fun of Britta's
boyfriend Vaughn.</font>

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good. Well, in that case.</font>

315
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we're gonna do something,
let's do it as a team.</font>

316
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the ball rolling.
Maybe he has a tiny penis.</font>

317
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is this guy?
- You all have got to see him.</font>

318
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's all,
"no worries, no worries."</font>

319
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he always says hello
three times in a row.</font>

320
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, good evening,
how are you?</font>

321
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:58,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... here, look!
He wrote a poem!</font>

322
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:01,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I read it?
- We shouldn't show that.</font>

323
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's fine.
- So I'll be done in, like, an hour.</font>

324
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:06,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, no worries.
- He just said it!</font>

325
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, you've met Vaughn, right?
- Hey. What's up? Hi.</font>

326
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What a fool.
- This troop's got a case of the giggles, huh?</font>

327
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait... is that...?</font>

328
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you give them my poem?</font>

329
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

330
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, why is the dinosaur
rocking a picture of my poem?</font>

331
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, read it.</font>

332
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:36,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys are... right?</font>

333
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are laughing at me, aren't you?</font>

334
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- No.</font>

335
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, uh, wow.</font>

336
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:48,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the least tight thing
that's ever happened to me.</font>

337
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:53,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you.</font>

338
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Jeff, how dare you?</font>

339
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hear him outside. He's crying.</font>

340
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's barking.</font>

341
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff, wait! I'm sorry I sold you out.
- Britta is never gonna forgive me.</font>

342
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:15,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I showed you that
poem. Oh, my god, my life is <i>Degrassi High.</i></font>

343
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff, I have a gossip problem.</font>

344
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:21,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stir the pot, Jeff. I'm a pot stirrer.</font>

345
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't even the only study
group I've had this year.</font>

346
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see those ladies over there?</font>

347
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:29,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to be in their group
till they kicked me out.</font>

348
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:33,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called me "tattle-ina."
It's a bumblebee nickname.</font>

349
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cute, but it stings.</font>

350
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look at the size
of that woman's earrings.</font>

351
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like little dogs
should be jumping through them.</font>

352
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is never going to work. This has to end.
- Look at them.</font>

353
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, don't do this.
Look, we can still hang out.</font>

354
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:52,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, you know,
we won't bag on people.</font>

355
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Jeff. What are
we gonna talk about?</font>

356
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">My kids? Your doctor career?</font>

357
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was a lawyer.
- See? I'm already bored.</font>

358
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:05,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll always have
"tiny nipples."</font>

359
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:07,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were tiny.</font>

360
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:11,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Jeff, wait, wait.
I know I shouldn't do this,</font>

361
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">but one last little piece of gossip.</font>

362
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta told me she had
a sex dream about you.</font>

363
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still have a chance.</font>

364
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Details.
- Mm.</font>

365
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Details! Details!</font>

366
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, here.</font>

367
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:36,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to say sorry
for yelling at you.</font>

368
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indiana Jones. Cool.</font>

369
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got the first three because...</font>

370
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The fourth one blows.
- The fourth one blows.</font>

371
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're cool.</font>

372
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta!
- I do not want to talk to you.</font>

373
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:52,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I know and I'm sorry.</font>

374
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry,</font>

375
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and I will go talk to Vaughn if you
want me to. - Vaughn broke up with me.</font>

376
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:03,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You broke my trust. You suck.
- No, I know, and I'm sorry,</font>

377
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was in a tough position.</font>

378
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't handle
just being one of the girls.</font>

379
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want to be?</font>

380
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a spot on
the friendship spectrum</font>

381
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:21,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">between total stranger and having
to hear about the guys you date?</font>

382
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:26,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ideally, just a notch underneath, driving
you to the airport and painting your kitchen?</font>

383
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:29,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about the friend level where you
sometimes have to cat-sit?</font>

384
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:34,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done. And if I'm occasionally naked
in your dreams, I won't complain.</font>

385
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:35,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shirley.
- I know.</font>

386
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a problem.
She stirs the pot.</font>

387
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a pot stirrer.</font>

388
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, dudes.</font>

389
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">No worries, man.</font>

390
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:47,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, some worries, man.
Some worries.</font>

391
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley would have said
something funny about that guy.</font>

392
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:05,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so I told him...
Oh, hey, Jeff.</font>

393
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:06,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

394
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:08,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

395
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:10,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce! Pierce,
give me your ear-thing.</font>

396
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got rid of it.</font>

397
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:18,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Jeff, there are certain things
man was not meant to hear.</font>

398
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:22,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were designed by...
whatever entity you choose,</font>

399
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:28,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hear what's in this range,
and really, this range alone.</font>

400
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you know who's
talking to us in this range?</font>

401
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people we love.</font>

402
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:44,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must have heard us
call him Inspector Gadget.</font>

403
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:52,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think it's time for burning man.</font>

404
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:55,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew, I'm Saddam Hussein. Ew.</font>

405
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:57,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you, dude.</font>

406
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow. I love reading and
being a desperate housewife.</font>

407
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:03,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, coming through. I love
the desperate housewives.</font>

408
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:10,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Dr. Doogie Seacrest. I think I'm better
than everyone else because I'm forty.</font>

409
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not forty.</font>

410
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hear you through
the window, morons.</font>

411
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pretend like you're asleep.</font>

412
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pretend like you were sleeping.</font>
