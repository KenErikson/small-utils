1
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:07,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Raisins don't belong
in a chocolate chip cookie.</font>

2
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It gives them depth.</font>

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, watch it, punk.</font>

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, 80?
He's trying to bring back disco.</font>

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have to be old
to know it's not gonna happen.</font>

6
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">What it is, soul brother.</font>

7
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boys are gonna make me
breakfast in bed for Mother's Day.</font>

8
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:26,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make breakfast and get in
bed, but they're gonna bring it to me.</font>

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.
Aw.</font>

10
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:29,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. They said
the cutest thing last night.</font>

11
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said, "Mama,"
they call me Mama...</font>

12
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be the fun police.
If I'm the fun police,</font>

13
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you're director
of Funland Security.</font>

14
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, more of this.
More of what?</font>

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?
The constant bickering.</font>

16
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was cute at first, but...</font>

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Abed explains it best.
Jeff and Britta is no Ross and Rachel.</font>

18
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sexual tension, lack of chemistry
are putting us on edge, ironically,</font>

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">on every level,
you're keeping us from being friends.</font>

20
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff and I
do not have sexual tension.</font>

21
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:56,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just argue all the time.</font>

22
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just like Sam and Diane.</font>

23
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated Sam and Diane.</font>

24
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are Sam and Diane?
Okay, we get it. You're young.</font>

25
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
See what you're doing to us?</font>

26
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want my advice?
Pork her and move on.</font>

27
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did it all the time in my day.</font>

28
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:12,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you also put hydrogen
in blimps, that was bad.</font>

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everybody.</font>

30
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a reminder.
Our Spring Fling is on the quad today.</font>

31
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:21,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Music, food, activities. What, what?</font>

32
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">He makes me uncomfortable.</font>

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still in the room.</font>

34
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's also going to be a game
of Paintball Assassin</font>

35
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a prize for last man standing.</font>

36
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or last man in a wheelchair
with no paint.</font>

37
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or last woman.</font>

38
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it a rest, Britta.
What's the prize?</font>

39
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a Blu-ray DVD player,
but it was stolen.</font>

40
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now it's TBD.</font>

41
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want TBD. Is that new?</font>

42
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's what I think,
I had it in the '70s.</font>

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get back to Britta and Jeff.
There's no Britta and Jeff.</font>

44
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, fully erect.</font>

45
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna let you guys figure this out
while I go take a nap in my car.</font>

46
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:01,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?</font>

47
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

49
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on?</font>

50
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">The paintball game was starting,</font>

51
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the dean...
The dean announced the prize.</font>

52
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prize.</font>

53
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">We turned on each other
like animals.</font>

54
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was the prize?
Was?</font>

55
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not over.</font>

56
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is still happening right now.</font>

57
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard? Leonard, I'm not playing.</font>

58
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's playing.</font>

59
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

60
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:54,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suck.</font>

61
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:01,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me if
you don't want paint on your clothes.</font>

62
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Look what I found
wandering the neutral zone.</font>

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger.</font>

64
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:17,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch.</font>

65
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were dead, man.</font>

66
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just taking a nap.</font>

67
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has everyone lost their mind?
It's just a game of paintball.</font>

68
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. With one rule.</font>

69
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:31,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last man standing gets the prize.
The prize.</font>

70
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prize.
What is this prize?</font>

71
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know.</font>

72
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priority registration.
Priority registration?</font>

73
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:46,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why everyone's running
around like a bunch...</font>

74
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that mean what I think?</font>

75
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you could have first choice
of your classes next semester?</font>

76
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, sugar bear.</font>

77
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you could schedule
all your classes on a Monday</font>

78
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">and take a six-day weekend.</font>

79
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could do a lot of things.</font>

80
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:06,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk him through the hunger.
Every student wants that prize, Jeff.</font>

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way to share it,
so we'll all turn on each other.</font>

82
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the longer we wait
to do that... Jeff.</font>

83
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">The longer we work together,
the longer we last.</font>

84
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone running in packs?</font>

85
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Debate team was first,
they fell to infighting.</font>

86
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The glee club is luring stragglers
into sniper traps</font>

87
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">with cheery renditions of songs.</font>

88
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

89
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">And people fall for that?
Yeah.</font>

90
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm all for winning,
but let's not resort to cheap ploys.</font>

91
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:33,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the girls in the game?</font>

92
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?
No, I don't mean Britta.</font>

93
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I say Britta?
Twice now.</font>

94
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chess Club.</font>

95
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

96
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a pawn.</font>

97
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:56,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checkmate, bitches.</font>

98
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell the drama club
their tears will be real today.</font>

99
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's all sugar, man.
Get some protein.</font>

100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here. Peanuts.</font>

101
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Peanuts, peanuts.</font>

102
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, take the stuff out closer to you.
No, no.</font>

103
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones in the back
are the freshest.</font>

104
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">That will keep us going. Yeah.</font>

105
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:21,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

106
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?
I got you covered, bro.</font>

107
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys formed an alliance
without me?</font>

108
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You with Star-Burns?</font>

109
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if I can be with you.</font>

110
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just Star-Burns.</font>

111
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone else need a pee break?</font>

112
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Yeah.</font>

113
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:38,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
Hey.</font>

114
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:40,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stand guard.
I don't need to pee.</font>

115
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm wearing a diaper for the game.
Oh, yeah.</font>

116
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the game.</font>

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, make this quick before
Pierce's chewing attracts enemies.</font>

118
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:14,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, guys?
Hold it.</font>

119
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move.
Drop it.</font>

120
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody, be cool.</font>

121
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:31,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can beat the others if we merge.
We're doing fine.</font>

122
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">You win the game
camped on a crapper?</font>

123
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worked on you.
Did it?</font>

124
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a gun in your face?
Matches yours.</font>

125
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice comeback.
Shut up.</font>

126
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez.
Jeez.</font>

127
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

128
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the agreement is we're allies</font>

129
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we're sure
we're the last seven standing.</font>

130
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:00,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thinking what I'm thinking?
Mm-hm.</font>

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our team's walking with God.</font>

132
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:05,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking we might already
be the only seven left,</font>

133
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">in which case,
this is a window for the two of us</font>

134
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take out the others.</font>

135
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real nice, Troy, that'd be
great PR for the black students.</font>

136
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not an ambassador.</font>

137
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am gladiator.</font>

138
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you want to win or not?</font>

139
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

140
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy made God mad.</font>

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take cover.</font>

142
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run, Pierce.</font>

143
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:38,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glee club.
How do you know it's the glee club?</font>

144
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

145
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪♪</font>

146
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, brother.</font>

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so uninspired.</font>

148
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not so sure.</font>

149
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a plan. Get ready.</font>

150
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:57,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Pierce.</font>

151
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't come over here, okay?</font>

152
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you. I'm coming over there.</font>

153
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Medic.</font>

154
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the trees. There.</font>

155
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write some original songs.</font>

156
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:29,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna do
if you win priority registration?</font>

157
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:32,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make my schedule airtight.</font>

158
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe get out of here
in 3 years instead of 4.</font>

159
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd take any class with no tests
and no papers.</font>

160
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you do, Shirley?</font>

161
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd choose all morning classes</font>

162
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could get home early
to spend some time with my boys.</font>

163
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard being away from them
so much.</font>

164
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

165
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:53,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say if any of us win, we give it
to Shirley as a Mother's Day gift.</font>

166
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.
What?</font>

167
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you don't have to do that.</font>

168
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sick of you guilting people
with your phony humanitarian shtick.</font>

169
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phony?
When I win, you can watch me do it.</font>

170
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,
but that won't make it less phony.</font>

171
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be a lot more likeable...
If I never did anything for anybody?</font>

172
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Because when you help people,
that always turns out great.</font>

173
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

174
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

175
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study group.</font>

176
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come out and play.</font>

177
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:25,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, it's post-ironic Disco Stu.
You still trying to bring it back?</font>

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

179
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, he brought it back.</font>

180
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your hands in the air.</font>

181
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.</font>

182
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">They shot us.</font>

183
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:55,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hot, it's hot. Let's go, fool.</font>

184
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last guy almost got me.</font>

185
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">My legs.</font>

186
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Shirley, I'm so sorry.</font>

187
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going home, Britta.</font>

188
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:23,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, Shirley, I know.</font>

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, seriously, I'm going home.
Can you help me up?</font>

190
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah, sure.</font>

191
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I'm gonna win
for you and your boys.</font>

192
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

193
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I'm gonna win that prize,
but not for you and your boys.</font>

194
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's less nice.</font>

195
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you've been hit.
What?</font>

196
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

197
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.</font>

198
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's blood.</font>

199
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was paint,
but I'm just bleeding.</font>

200
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk about luck.</font>

201
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe this game
is still going on. It's 2 a.m.</font>

202
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:13,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if someone gets hurt
and the police come?</font>

203
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll think I'm a bad dean.</font>

204
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's classes in the morning.
This has to stop.</font>

205
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

206
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me in the game,
because I'll take everyone out.</font>

207
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I play paintball
three times a week, bro.</font>

208
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:30,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm one of the douches
who brings his own equipment.</font>

209
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it wouldn't be fair.
You're not a student.</font>

210
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can change that,
can't you? Huh?</font>

211
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enroll me in a class.</font>

212
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are your interests?
Arts and crafts.</font>

213
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I do watercolors.
Oh, cool.</font>

214
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group would be thrilled.</font>

215
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:03,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wounded soldier fantasy means
we're moments from doing it, right?</font>

216
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:08,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, can you feel that tension?
It's a miracle we still have clothes on.</font>

217
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, you know.</font>

218
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:14,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a phony.</font>

219
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to act compassionate,
because I'm afraid that I'm not.</font>

220
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please, I invented phony.</font>

221
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">You care about people.</font>

222
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accuse you of faking to convince
myself I'm not such a jerk.</font>

223
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you help people more than I do,
and you don't even want to.</font>

224
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a jerk. You're fine.</font>

225
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially now that I've repaired
your overworked torso</font>

226
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my trembling
feminine fingers.</font>

227
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Too much sexual tension.</font>

228
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn bursting.</font>

229
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:48,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would totally serve them right
if we did it here in the study room.</font>

230
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, could you imagine?
I can't stop imagining.</font>

231
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither can I.</font>

232
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get dressed before
the third-shift librarian shows up.</font>

233
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,711
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, we don't want this to turn
into a letter to Penthouse, right?</i></font>

234
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:11,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the group is right.
We did need to relieve some tension.</font>

235
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me you didn't have sex with me
to win at paintball.</font>

236
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I had sex with you,
and I'm gonna win at paintball.</font>

237
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be gross.
I'm gross?</font>

238
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:26,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem pretty practiced
at putting on panties one-handed</font>

239
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:27,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">while holding a gun.</font>

240
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get dressed
before you assassinate me?</font>

241
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">So all that happened,
it meant nothing to you?</font>

242
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say that.
What did it mean to you?</font>

243
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you first.
Very mature.</font>

244
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said the woman wearing Hello Kitty.
Said the woman holding the gun.</font>

245
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure that's a gun?</font>

246
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because maybe it's a metaphor
for your fake, jaded persona.</font>

247
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

248
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">No paintballs, Hans?
What do you think, I'm stupid?</font>

249
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">When'd you take it?
When you started seducing.</font>

250
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:01,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't though. Assuming that
makes you way grosser.</font>

251
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not when I'm right.</font>

252
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:34,573
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Buenos dias, children.
You'll be happy to know you made it till the end.</i></font>

253
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not even a student.
Wrong.</font>

254
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Critical Media Literacy
and Politics of Gender, biatch.</font>

255
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your clip.
Oh, that would be brilliant of me.</font>

256
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you got the drop on me. I lost.</font>

257
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me do this for you.</font>

258
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be pretty crazy
if I shot you right now, huh?</font>

259
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:37,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so funny, Chang?</font>

260
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's the fact there's no such
thing as priority registration.</font>

261
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:45,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe it's this.</font>

262
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ta-da.</font>

263
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean.</font>

264
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one moment.</font>

265
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi there, Jeffrey.</font>

266
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good look for you.</font>

267
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody out there
is shooting each other</font>

268
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:35,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">for nothing while you sit here
in your ivory tower.</font>

269
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I can explain.</font>

270
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I messed up
when I promised priority registration.</font>

271
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a violation
of some student equality act,</font>

272
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:47,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this isn't. Ta-da!</font>

273
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now, it's not Blu-ray, but it
comes with its own remote, so...</font>

274
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:55,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

275
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:00,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

276
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:02,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

277
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

278
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get it all out of your system?</font>

279
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost.</font>

280
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me, Jeffrey?
Guess.</font>

281
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi.
Hey, how's it going?</font>

282
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still have some paint.</font>

283
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks.</font>

284
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I was thinking...
You don't have to.</font>

285
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't happen. It's not a mistake.</font>

286
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't happen.
It was a crazy night of paintball.</font>

287
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. Tension relieving.</font>

288
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely. No need
to mention it to anyone.</font>

289
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.</font>

290
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's changed.</font>

291
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed. Crazy Abed.</font>

292
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, something's different now.</font>

293
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be me. Sporting a man-thong.
Maybe.</font>

294
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:12,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe it's that I
have emerged victorious</font>

295
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a priority registration form.</font>

296
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,120
