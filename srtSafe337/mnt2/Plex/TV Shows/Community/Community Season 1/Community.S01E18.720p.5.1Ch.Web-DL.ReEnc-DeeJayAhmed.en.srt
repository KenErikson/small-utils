1
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:05,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Haven't seen you all day.</font>

2
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:06,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah. I've been really busy.</font>

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus I had to find 30 extra chairs for
my classroom since it's Family Day.</font>

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Speaking of, I was gonna invite
my mom so you could meet her</font>

5
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh, she still thinks
I'm a lawyer.</font>

6
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look. A Human Being
has a little Human with it.</font>

7
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">How bloodcurdlingly adorable.</font>

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we need to talk.</font>

9
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:21,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?
Are you breaking up with me?</font>

10
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Heh-heh.
Maybe we don't need to talk.</font>

11
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:29,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so excited for everybody
to meet my sons.</font>

12
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope they're not twins. Twins freak me out.
They always know what</font>

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">the other one is... Yeah.
Thinking?</font>

14
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And finishing each other's...
Pie.</font>

15
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. It's creepy.
It's nice spending time with them.</font>

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get to see them that much
since I started school.</font>

17
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:43,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister likes to joke they don't recognize me
anymore, and I like to joke she's just jealous</font>

18
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she's barren.
Hmm.</font>

19
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:47,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad's bringing cousin Abra.
She's visiting from Gaza.</font>

20
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she look like you,
but in a wig and lipstick?</font>

21
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's Halle Berry.</font>

22
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abra wears a full burka in public so she just looks
like someone covered head to toe in black fabric.</font>

23
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:58,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe my grandma's
rolling her old bones down here.</font>

24
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta pick a cabinet to hide in.</font>

25
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hide from her?
Yeah, she's crazy.</font>

26
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy. Society programs us to dispose
of the elderly because they don't work</font>

27
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:10,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">or buy things, but don't be blind
to your grandmother's value.</font>

28
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:13,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to cherish her.
You cherish her.</font>

29
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I will.
She's not gonna be around forever.</font>

30
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna believe you're right, Britta,
but you never quite are, are you?</font>

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I'm late.
Was somebody canoodling</font>

32
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:24,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a certain professor?</font>

33
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, no. She dumped me.</font>

34
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:32,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, that's so sad.
I'll give Jeff a shoulder to cry on.</font>

35
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">You boys put a dead bird
in that bitch's glove compartment.</font>

36
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:36,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.
Guys, guys, sit.</font>

37
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:39,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I don't need to cry. I'm fine.</font>

38
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:42,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we're your friends.
Let it all out.</font>

39
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to let out.</font>

40
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:46,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just glad I didn't have to do
the dumping.</font>

41
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'd have to lay low
for three weeks to look sensitive.</font>

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">on campus now and all anyone
will feel for me is sorry.</font>

43
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew. Not anymore.</font>

44
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:01,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your heart's desensitized, Jeff.</font>

45
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a machine.
It feels no love, just sex.</font>

46
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like the Booty-nator.</font>

47
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Booty-nator?
Like "I'll be back," but with booty.</font>

48
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would Booty-nator be back
with booty?</font>

49
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't he just try and kill it?</font>

50
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe he kills it,
then brings it back as a trophy.</font>

51
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he want dead booty?
I want Pirate's Booty.</font>

52
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're hungry?
Guys.</font>

53
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:23,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be back, but with booty.
Yeah.</font>

54
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:24,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's beneath you.
Gross.</font>

55
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're too gorgeous
to be a teacher</font>

56
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're too happy
to be a student.</font>

57
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me
to where your car broke down.</font>

58
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:38,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for Family Day.
I'm looking for my family.</font>

59
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:41,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, at the very least,
I could fill in for a creepy uncle.</font>

60
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.
Amber.</font>

61
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is.</font>

62
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you, all grown up.</font>

63
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:49,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, this is my stepdaughter, Amber.
Small world.</font>

64
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:53,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, actually, it's a very big world with
5 billion other women in it. Heh-heh.</font>

65
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

66
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'll show you around.</font>

67
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm back.
Without booty.</font>

68
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I feel sorry for you.</font>

69
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands in the air.
Homeland Security.</font>

70
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys, leave that man alone.</font>

71
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orange alert. Orange alert.</font>

72
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. They're just excited.</font>

73
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're, uh, Abed's father?
I'm Shirley.</font>

74
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:34,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's Elijah like the prophet and
Jordan like the 14-time NBA All-Star.</font>

75
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gubi Nadir.
Is it how you say hello?</font>

76
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my name.</font>

77
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! I'm sorry, you...
You're like a black ghost.</font>

78
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my cousin, Abra.</font>

79
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greetings.</font>

80
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over the course
of seven marriages,</font>

81
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:53,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I amassed some 32 stepchildren
and obviously, Amber's my favorite.</font>

82
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there was something
about his mass e-mails</font>

83
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">that made me certain
this would be a family reunion.</font>

84
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sure is, sweetie.</font>

85
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to photography school.
Oh, sounds interesting.</font>

86
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:04,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it in your pants.</font>

87
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:08,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're embarrassing yourself. She
may be hot, but she's my princess.</font>

88
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step princess.</font>

89
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Family Day.</font>

90
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see what we got here.</font>

91
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:19,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. I can't believe Star-Burns
isn't a virgin.</font>

92
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:23,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">But judging from that Bluetooth
headset, his son is. Ch-chang!</font>

93
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger.</font>

94
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too cool for family?</font>

95
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:29,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone here is my family.
Oh...</font>

96
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weak.
Cute.</font>

97
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your family, El Tigre?
Ugh.</font>

98
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">My older brother
will be at the barbecue.</font>

99
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:39,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's none of your business,
but I ate my twin in utero.</font>

100
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Hey, Phantom Menace.</font>

101
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's the trade embargo
with the Naboo?</font>

102
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, oh, looks like Pierce
broke the piggy bank</font>

103
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the escort service this time.</font>

104
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, duck sauce. That was rude.</font>

105
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:56,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">The call girls I frequent are not nearly
as attractive as my daughter.</font>

106
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:58,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stepdaughter.</font>

107
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically, ex-stepdaughter.</font>

108
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, your mother April...
Mm-hm. Wanda, her name's...</font>

109
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it Wanda? Yes.
Yes.</font>

110
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need one sec. Excuse me.</font>

111
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Jeff, Jeff. Uh...</font>

112
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cards on the table, Jeff.</font>

113
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amber's the best shot
I'll ever have</font>

114
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:19,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">at something like a real daughter
and I'm striking out.</font>

115
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you told her
she's prettier than a hooker?</font>

116
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you come to the barbecue...</font>

117
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you'd never think
of touching her.</font>

118
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you could say
a couple cool things about me.</font>

119
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:33,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to wingman you
with your ex-stepdaughter?</font>

120
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I got a thing.</font>

121
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a thing?</font>

122
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and it's on the rebound.</font>

123
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:43,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not subjecting it to a night
with a hot girl that I can't have.</font>

124
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't holster it for a friend?</font>

125
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Pierce is barely a friend.</font>

126
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:48,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's no more related to Amber
than you are,</font>

127
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">and was a total jag
about shutting me down.</font>

128
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much effort do I rate?
For you?</font>

129
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I'd break a light sweat.</font>

130
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, I need a favor.</font>

131
00:05:58,273 --> 00:05:59,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help Pierce with his stepdaughter?</font>

132
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're becoming dangerous, Annie.</font>

133
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's those doe eyes.</font>

134
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disappointing you is like choking
the Little Mermaid with a bike chain.</font>

135
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this Nana Barnes?</font>

136
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy didn't mention
you were such a knockout.</font>

137
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that supposed to mean?
Oh. Come on.</font>

138
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you've broken a few hearts
in your time.</font>

139
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:21,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

140
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

141
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many men
do you think I've laid with?</font>

142
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:30,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?
I am Britta.</font>

143
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have offended you
and I am sorry.</font>

144
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anything I can get you?</font>

145
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

146
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get me a switch.
A what now?</font>

147
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not family, Nana.
You can't make her get a switch.</font>

148
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can make me get it.
I just have to know what it is.</font>

149
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">A switch is a stick she can use
to whoop you with.</font>

150
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:54,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cherish, Britta. Cherish.</font>

151
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. Well, it was wonderful
meeting your brother.</font>

152
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adios, Señor Chang,
shalom, Rabbi Chang,</font>

153
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to both of you, sayonara.</font>

154
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go.</font>

155
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Señor Chang?</font>

156
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?</font>

157
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that is who I am. So drop it.</font>

158
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dropping. I'm dropping.</font>

159
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:20,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa. Amber alert.
You are allergic to peanuts.</font>

160
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:23,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">That might be a different step kid.</font>

161
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:24,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">My flight actually leaves so...</font>

162
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your flight actually leaves
after I tell you a story called:</font>

163
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:31,227
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Pierce Takes On The School Bully.</i></font>

164
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh.
Are you a ninja</font>

165
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, baby. Don't be rude.</font>

166
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:38,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, she's wearing a burka.</font>

167
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a way women to
express their modesty.</font>

168
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like Islamic turtlenecks.
Ask her if she wants to play with us.</font>

169
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bouncy house.</font>

170
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds heated.
Did she call him a pig's anus or something?</font>

171
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's saying she's old
enough to jump in a giant balloon.</font>

172
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's saying he's overprotective.</font>

173
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now she says he's a pig anus.</font>

174
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">That fight made me crave a hot dog.</font>

175
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay put, boys. I'll be right back.</font>

176
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:24,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at them.
You are a bad mother.</font>

177
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:25,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Control your children.</font>

178
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:29,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go back to my car
and get my emergency shirt.</font>

179
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't even like that shirt.</font>

180
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only did he join a band,
they got jealous and booted him.</font>

181
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:36,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

182
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh-heh.
That's exactly what they said.</font>

183
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off to the bathroom, Stepdad.</font>

184
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:46,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been called Stepdad.
I don't think anyone has.</font>

185
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:50,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, when she gets back, come up with
some reason why you have to leave, okay?</font>

186
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:52,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll beg you to stay, but you don't.</font>

187
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, why don't you just leave now.
Cut our work in half.</font>

188
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, buddy.</font>

189
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:09,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're leaving?
My girlfriend is pregnant.</font>

190
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce said you were gay.
He...</font>

191
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup. As the sunrise.</font>

192
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm deeply ashamed.</font>

193
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just glad I have friends like Pierce
to keep me...</font>

194
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honest.</font>

195
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is slightly wrong.</font>

196
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too much tongue?
Just enough.</font>

197
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it... It's Pierce.</font>

198
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean the guy who decided
he doesn't want men</font>

199
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:39,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">touching his ex-stepdaughter, but
divorced Mom for our housekeeper?</font>

200
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:40,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be the same guy, yeah.</font>

201
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amber?</font>

202
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amber, there you are.</font>

203
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:49,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here, Jeff?
I go to school here, remember?</font>

204
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem. There's a Pictionary
tournament in the student lounge.</font>

205
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds fun. Is Jeff joining us?</font>

206
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:57,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if he can, can you?
I can't.</font>

207
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Come on, stay.
Stay.</font>

208
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:00,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.
Maybe I shouldn't, either.</font>

209
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay, Jeff.
You think I should?</font>

210
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:05,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you have to.</font>

211
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stay.
Me too.</font>

212
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha. Good Family Day.</font>

213
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:17,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

214
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting Nana a switch.</font>

215
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, stop pretending that
my mean old nana is awesome.</font>

216
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not pretending.</font>

217
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's cool that she's got
her own style of discipline.</font>

218
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nana's old school.</font>

219
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:32,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, my mom told me there'd
be white people that did this.</font>

220
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the pocket watches
and coffee grinders,</font>

221
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:36,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pretending
to be into steamboats.</font>

222
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let's get this straight.</font>

223
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is real life.</font>

224
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Nana is gonna whoop you.</font>

225
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not unless I find her a switch.</font>

226
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about this?</font>

227
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's a great switch, Britta.</font>

228
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very hip. Should hurt a lot.</font>

229
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, where's Elijah and Jordan?
Uh, Abed?</font>

230
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what a surprise
that you lost them.</font>

231
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're playing hide and seek.</font>

232
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, where?
I don't think that's how it works.</font>

233
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop screwing around, Abed.</font>

234
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you want to yell at someone?
Go find your crazy kids.</font>

235
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boy is disciplined.
It's not his job...</font>

236
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:12,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you got me, Gubi.
I'm a bad mother.</font>

237
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:16,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let my kids be kids instead
of acting like a jail warden.</font>

238
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. You don't like her burka?
I'm not talking about the burka.</font>

239
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking about her
never having any fun.</font>

240
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Abra, you look me in the eyes
and you tell me...</font>

241
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:26,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

242
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I seemed to have forgotten
the napkins.</font>

243
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:33,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do... Do you mind?
Fine.</font>

244
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm the napkin man.</font>

245
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Uh-huh.</font>

246
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Circle.</font>

247
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Circle with a squiggly line.</font>

248
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:57,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Squiggly line circle.</font>

249
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You did hear me say circle.</font>

250
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:03,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smiling sideways vagina.
No.</font>

251
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy sideways vagina.
No.</font>

252
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy face.</font>

253
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's a clam?</font>

254
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:12,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">As happy as a clam.
Yes.</font>

255
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">As happy as a clam?
What a gay guess.</font>

256
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot.
Pierce, you're up.</font>

257
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat my dust, Winger.</font>

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do know
we're on the same team?</font>

259
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:24,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

260
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

261
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, here we go. Uh...</font>

262
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see.</font>

263
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't, uh...</font>

264
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce you have to add more.
Draw more.</font>

265
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.
Stop circling the same thing.</font>

266
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:49,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess something,
you girlfriendless geek.</font>

267
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:53,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you drawing?
You're supposed to know, stupid.</font>

268
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

269
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get this.</font>

270
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they'll both drop charges,
but we gotta take statements.</font>

271
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:04,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be a while.</font>

272
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I may just be a simple cop,
but people need to know.</font>

273
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:11,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't gonna stop until Pictionary
bans the word windmill.</font>

274
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:14,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, we'll meet you at the gala.
We're gonna go get you some coffee.</font>

275
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:16,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is coffee code for sex?</font>

276
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

277
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

278
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:25,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nana, here's your switch.
Bring it here.</font>

279
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make do.</font>

280
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Let me have it.</font>

281
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't no nun. Bend over.</font>

282
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your pants
and get over my lap.</font>

283
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do is walk away.</font>

284
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:01,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
She's respecting her elders.</font>

285
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">See Troy?
Did you think I was a hypocrite?</font>

286
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:05,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I wouldn't really...
Okay, that really...</font>

287
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Okay, that really...</font>

288
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand you, Britta.</font>

289
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand you at all.</font>

290
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:20,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

291
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally wrong room.
Will you get the door?</font>

292
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:26,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... She's had enough.</font>

293
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... She's had enough.</font>

294
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's focus on you,
the forbidden fruit</font>

295
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is the ex-stepdaughter
of a casual acquaintance.</font>

296
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:42,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oops. Don't wanna lose that.</font>

297
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have a $25,000
check from Pierce?</font>

298
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:48,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tuition for fashion school.</font>

299
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:50,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not photography school?</font>

300
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">You caught me.</font>

301
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Maybe I'll just buy a car.</font>

302
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:58,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can just do that, huh?</font>

303
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:01,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it helps that he's
kind of desperate and stupid.</font>

304
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:04,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you wanna be a good person right
now or did you wanna be with me?</font>

305
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:12,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there you are.</font>

306
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:13,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks a lot, Pollyanna.</font>

307
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made me hang out with Pierce
and his stepdaughter.</font>

308
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's grifting him.
She's what?</font>

309
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's taking a bunch
of money from him.</font>

310
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks it's for school,
but it's for grifting.</font>

311
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you tell him?</font>

312
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:28,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that simple.
It's not?</font>

313
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my... Jeff.</font>

314
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gross. You're gross.</font>

315
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it with her?
Yeah, but not twice.</font>

316
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to do it twice.</font>

317
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:39,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gross.</font>

318
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:44,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">You met her this morning.
You're faster than some bacteria.</font>

319
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:46,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you just doing this
because Slater hurt you?</font>

320
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No, I'm not hurt.</font>

321
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Amber threw herself at me.</font>

322
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:52,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you still have to tell Pierce that
she's taking advantage of him, don't you?</font>

323
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:57,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when you think about it,
nobody's getting hurt.</font>

324
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce is getting a daughter, Amber's
getting an allowance, I'm getting...</font>

325
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:03,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">We already talked about it.
But don't forget this is Pierce.</font>

326
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a racist, homophobic old goof.</font>

327
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">He does bad stuff all the time.</font>

328
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it sounds like you've got it
all figured out,</font>

329
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">so why are you talking to me
about it?</font>

330
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're...</font>

331
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:17,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.</font>

332
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">A decent person?
Maybe.</font>

333
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you knew talking to me about it
would make you feel like a bad friend.</font>

334
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:25,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to feel like a bad friend
because you wanna be a good friend?</font>

335
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:28,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really suck, you know that?</font>

336
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, mm, mm! Go get you and your brother
some Ding Dongs and calm down.</font>

337
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

338
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?
Oh. Abed, did your family take off?</font>

339
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:42,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Thanks for distracting my dad while
we helped Abra get back in her burka.</font>

340
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:45,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if a young lady wants to go
in a bouncy house, she should go.</font>

341
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:48,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a noble thing you did.
Oh, I didn't do it.</font>

342
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:51,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it was Jordan and Elijah's idea.
They're good kids.</font>

343
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they weren't,
they wouldn't help Abra.</font>

344
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see why you were so excited
for me to meet them.</font>

345
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be proud of them.</font>

346
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good mom.
Oh. Come on.</font>

347
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:02,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mom. Look what I got.</font>

348
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:06,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ding Dongs, my favorite.</font>

349
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
Ha-ha.</font>

350
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:11,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty rough, huh?
Mm.</font>

351
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

352
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nana is a monster.
What did you say?</font>

353
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said you were a monster, ma'am.</font>

354
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you said Troy was right.</font>

355
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me a switch.</font>

356
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

357
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, stranger.</font>

358
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:33,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna pick up where we left off</font>

359
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:35,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I log some time
with Daddy Warbucks?</font>

360
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Amber. Uh...</font>

361
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:41,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought about it and what I want
is for you to tear up that check</font>

362
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">and go dance with your stepdad.</font>

363
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to get me
to cut you in?</font>

364
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have leverage.</font>

365
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I walk over there
and tell him everything,</font>

366
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:51,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">guess who he'll forgive.</font>

367
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:54,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, but I'd rather be the bad guy
than watch you siphon him.</font>

368
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:55,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about this?</font>

369
00:17:56,035 --> 00:18:00,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I walk away and if the check clears,
I won't make problems for you.</font>

370
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:01,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stay gone.</font>

371
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back whenever you want,</font>

372
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">but be good to him when you do
because I'll be around.</font>

373
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his friend.</font>

374
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:10,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can be his stepdaughter,
or not.</font>

375
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

376
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:16,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take the 25 grand.</font>

377
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over him, I'd take 25 cents.</font>

378
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

379
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff. Heh.</font>

380
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen Amber?
Yeah.</font>

381
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:33,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Pierce. Uh...
I gotta tell you something.</font>

382
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not coming, is she?</font>

383
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:37,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote her a pretty big check
this afternoon.</font>

384
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a feeling
she might take it and run.</font>

385
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to help you cancel it?
Oh, hell, she earned it.</font>

386
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky, Jeff.
It's not too late for you.</font>

387
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:49,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a family. Share your life.</font>

388
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">That and understanding computers
are two things</font>

389
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">you just can't knock out
at the end.</font>

390
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:59,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, who did you call last week
after you farted on Vaughn?</font>

391
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:01,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha. You.
And who did Abed call</font>

392
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">after that squirrel
stole his hotdog?</font>

393
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.
That's sharing your life.</font>

394
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have friends, you have family.</font>

395
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

396
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here, son.</font>

397
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we hugging or dancing?</font>

398
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
if the roles were reversed,</font>

399
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have had sex
with your ex-stepdaughter.</font>

400
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

401
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chip off the old block.</font>

402
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:40,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was either that
or deal with your actual pain.</font>

403
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">What pain?</font>

404
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:44,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelve o'clock.</font>

405
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you kidding me? l...</font>

406
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:55,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, it's okay.</font>

407
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it out.</font>

408
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:01,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">We always used to watch the shows
she wanted to watch.</font>

409
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:05,425
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hate Glee.
I'm not crazy about Glee, either.</i></font>

410
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate it.</font>

411
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand the appeal at all.</font>

412
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:16,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did we do this again?</font>

413
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought it looked fun.
Is your cell phone in your pocket?</font>

414
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I can't reach it.
I can only move my right arm.</font>

415
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. There's money
already in there.</font>

416
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slide your arm through that bottom
slot and press the button G-14.</font>

417
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a snack is selected, the mechanical lever
that's holding it will be thrust forward,</font>

418
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">thereby knocking your cell phone out of
your pocket and into the receptacle below.</font>

419
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:34,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could pick it up and call for help.</font>

420
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

421
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:44,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy?</font>

422
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:47,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I hit G-13.</font>
