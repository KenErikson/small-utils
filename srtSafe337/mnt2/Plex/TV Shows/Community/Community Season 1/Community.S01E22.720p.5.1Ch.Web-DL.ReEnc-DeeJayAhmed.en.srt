00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Britta, what
are you gonna knitta?</font>

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good mood, bad rhyme and is
that a carb on your plate?</font>

3
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a B on my nutrition final</font>

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:16,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am celebrating with pie
and a dollop of whipped irony.</font>

5
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:19,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. I'm knitting something
for my new cat.</font>

6
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:22,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been two weeks since I lost Suzie B,
so I figured it was time to move on.</font>

7
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not being an animal lover, I assume it'll
nice to start over with a fresh kitten.</font>

8
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:28,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fresh kitten?</font>

9
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:33,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go to a shelter and rescue an animal
that genuinely needs my help, okay?</font>

10
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:36,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think I am knitting
a tiny, little eye patch?</font>

11
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, hi.</font>

12
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in high school but we're taking
classes for college credit.</font>

13
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, all right.
Way to be go-getters.</font>

14
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
So we were just wondering,</font>

15
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">can you tell us exactly what you
did in your lives to end up here</font>

16
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that we don't make
the same mistakes?</font>

17
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:56,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, because if I end up 35</font>

18
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:00,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and celebrating a B in nutrition
in community college,</font>

19
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:01,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill myself.</font>

20
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:05,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it.
Yeah, watch it.</font>

21
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:06,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what, schmitty?</font>

22
00:01:08,054 --> 00:01:09,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmitty.</font>

23
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:12,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna knit me something sad in your
house full of cats with no furniture?</font>

24
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, it is a studio apartment
and knitting is hip.</font>

25
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winona Ryder knits.</font>

26
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,891

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmitty.
Schmitty.</font>

28
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmits.
Schmitty.</font>

29
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:28,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have done things
with my life, awesome things.</font>

30
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been to 14 countries.</font>

31
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:32,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I helped build a school in Kenya.</font>

32
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:35,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once met Sting
at a Cracker Barrel.</font>

33
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:37,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you letting
a bunch of teenagers get to you?</font>

34
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:40,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even remember what they said.
It just rolled...</font>

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you stop tuning that guitar?
You are 105 years old!</font>

36
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what you did with your life
to end up here</font>

37
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I don't make
the same mistakes!</font>

38
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me!</font>

39
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:57,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's springtime
and I thought I might woo a few chicks.</font>

45
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:17,248

00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what?</font>

47
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

48
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:26,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,656
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Animal House.</i></font>

50
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:31,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">A reference my ears applaud.
I couldn't resist.</font>

51
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smashing the guitar
of someone singing a love song</font>

52
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">was on my quintessential
college experience list.</font>

53
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:36,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your what?
It's a list</font>

54
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">of everything movies have taught me comprises
a successful first year at college.</font>

55
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bond with a group of lovable misfits."
Check.</font>

56
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Take on the school bully."
Check.</font>

57
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Make out with the hottest girl."
Check-a-rooni.</font>

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?
No.</font>

59
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:52,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, the school year is almost
over and there's stuff left on the list.</font>

60
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll help you finish it.
I'll be like your Morgan Freeman.</font>

61
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:57,657
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like in The Bucket List.
The what?</i></font>

62
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:00,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand up for a second.</font>

63
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come over here. Stand there.</font>

64
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:08,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, turn around.
Okay.</font>

65
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?
Pantsing someone was on my list.</font>

66
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would've been better if you were wearing
the giant hearts underwear, but I'll take it.</font>

67
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:21,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah? Well, I hope
getting pantsed is on your list.</font>

68
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

69
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so funny?</font>

70
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:31,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">This.</font>

71
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

72
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:42,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it?</font>

73
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally.
No, Pierce.</font>

74
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley is way too angry
to talk to you right now.</font>

75
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you'll have
to apologize later.</font>

76
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologize for what?
She should apologize to me.</font>

77
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">She ruined my joke.</font>

78
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:15,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

79
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a grandpa schlip-schlap.</font>

80
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen my schmitty, sonny?</font>

81
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me,
I'm gonna crap my pants.</font>

82
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone help me.</font>

83
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, nutrition, this is your life?</font>

84
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I was a lawyer.</font>

85
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:30,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like that went well.</font>

86
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you hang out
with schlip-schlap and schlap-skank...</font>

87
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God,
is she wearing a Discman?</font>

88
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do this to me?
What?</font>

89
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Discmans are retro.</font>

90
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:50,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is retro when you're 30 and broke
and can't afford an iPod, schmitty?</font>

91
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think "schmitty" means loser.</font>

92
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:57,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know.
We know.</font>

93
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may come back in now.
I have something to say.</font>

94
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">This better be a good apology.</font>

95
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has been a long time coming.
We have joked and rolled eyes at him.</font>

96
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there has been
a transgression today.</font>

97
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:12,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will no longer continue to be
a part of the group with this man.</font>

98
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just skip to the "I'm sorry."</font>

99
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:17,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are pathological
and you will never change.</font>

100
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:22,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! That is the pot calling the kettle
a kettle, okay?</font>

101
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:24,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can say black, Pierce.
I'm a black woman.</font>

102
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cat is out the bag.</font>

103
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:29,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have literally identified me
to strangers as "the black woman."</font>

104
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of context.
Context is everything.</font>

105
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:36,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call the other women "flat-butt"
and "the one Abed wants to nail."</font>

106
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:38,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you?
Not me.</font>

107
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's the context for constantly
referring to me as a lesbian?</font>

108
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:47,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the wallet chain fits...
I'm just trying to help you find yourself.</font>

109
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least he doesn't think
Shirley's my mom anymore.</font>

110
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:51,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks we're cousins.</font>

111
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not?</font>

112
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">He still assumes I'm a terrorist.</font>

113
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:57,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're not, I'm sorry.
If you are, I'm a hero.</font>

114
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:58,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm willing to take that chance.</font>

115
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said I have a crafty Jew brain.</font>

116
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody knows how to take
a compliment anymore.</font>

117
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, either he leaves the group
or I do.</font>

118
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:11,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just dug your own grave.</font>

119
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:26,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up?</font>

120
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">They kicked me out of the group.
Whoa.</font>

121
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna buy some cookies?
Ten bucks a box.</font>

122
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap, damn it.</font>

123
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen a Chinese kid?</font>

124
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:44,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twerps.</font>

125
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Pierce. How is it going?</font>

126
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unrepentant child.
Such a child.</font>

127
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here comes
stinky turd face.</font>

128
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember,
we don't stop till he's crying.</font>

129
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, check out Franken-mom.
Oh, we can use that.</font>

130
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no wedding ring.
He's a child of divorce.</font>

131
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:07,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can make fun of him
for coming from a broken home.</font>

132
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if this gets dirty.
He asked for it.</font>

133
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

134
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready to meet

137
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:24,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Clearasil, what time
is your mommy picking you up?</font>

138

140
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:33,932

141
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That's a clever retort." Duh!</font>

142
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:38,639

148
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, forget this. Duh!</font>

149
00:07:51,657 --> 00:07:54,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you going, schmitty?
I'm sorry, little schmitty.</font>

150
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mimicry is the lowest form...
Stop talking.</font>

151
00:07:57,596 --> 00:08:00,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Mimicry is the lowest form of..."
Stop talking.</font>

152
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Hey, you two.</font>

153
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

154
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Billy,
City College's mascot.</font>

155
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:12,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stealing a mascot was part of the list.
Check.</font>

156
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:15,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bringing a goat to our study group,
that's a great idea, Troy.</font>

157
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:17,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, must have been hard
for you to say that.</font>

158
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called sarcasm, Troy.
Ask the goat to explain it to you.</font>

159
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I feel like I'm being dissed?
Because you are being dissed.</font>

160
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:29,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you two dissing Troy?
They no longer have Pierce.</font>

161
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

162
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:34,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce's universally recognized social flaws
made him the scapegoat, a lightning rod.</font>

163
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's gone, so there's
lightning everywhere.</font>

164
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:39,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds dangerous.
My uncle was struck by lightning.</font>

165
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:42,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think it'd give superpowers, but
now he just masturbates in theaters.</font>

166
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very dangerous.</font>

167
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:46,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've lost our Cliff Clavin,
our George Costanza,</font>

168
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">our Turtle or Johnny Drama
or Eve.</font>

169
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, that show is sloppy.</font>

170
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gonna happen?</font>

171
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only a matter of time before
one of us becomes the new Pierce.</font>

172
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I sure as hell am not
gonna be the new Pierce.</font>

173
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:03,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if all we
need is an escape-goat,</font>

174
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:06,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
we should just let this one go.</font>

175
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes,
you've got to be pretending, Troy.</font>

176
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the new Pierce is Britta.
Yeah, right.</font>

177
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you
pronounce bagel again?</font>

178
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bagel.
She calls bagels, bagels.</font>

179
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do make fun of a lot
of what you do and say.</font>

180
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right to my face,
because I can take it,</font>

181
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">unlike a certain someone else.</font>

182
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:26,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Ah.</font>

183
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:28,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not make fun of Annie.
No, no.</font>

184
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:32,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want pity. Come to think of it,
after Pierce, you're the most bigoted.</font>

185
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
You found out I was Jewish,</font>

186
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">you invited me to a "pool" party.
Turned out to be a baptism.</font>

187
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me for trying
to sneak you into heaven.</font>

188
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:42,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Abed? Abed's weird.</font>

189
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's not it.
He's all right, we like Abed.</font>

190
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, have you considered
the new Pierce concept is stupid?</font>

191
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:55,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spoken like the new Pierce.
You're right.</font>

192
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not the new Pierce.
You are too.</font>

193
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said "the World Wide Web."</font>

194
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn the old Pierce.
He makes me mad.</font>

195
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't double Pierce me.
You're the triple Pierce.</font>

196
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:05,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so unfair.
Guys, guys.</font>

197
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
I'm gonna utter these words,</font>

198
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we need Pierce
in this group.</font>

199
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we can't ask Shirley to let him
back in, that would be so insensitive.</font>

200
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe he'll admit
he's wrong.</font>

201
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:21,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three, four, uh, not.</font>

202
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:26,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need Pierce.</font>

203
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stick to the
script and make it sincere.</font>

204
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not gonna be sincere,
I'm pretending to apologize.</font>

205
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:35,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but you're not getting back into the
group unless she thinks you're sincere.</font>

206
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stubborn fool.
Can we, um, hurry this up?</font>

207
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and I are pledging
the cool fraternity.</font>

208
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:43,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbeknownst to us, we're the target of ridicule
and don't have a chance of getting in.</font>

209
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:46,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. They're making us walk
around with pretzels in our butts.</font>

210
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:47,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put mustard on mine like an idiot.</font>

211
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:52,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Pierce, you can do this.</font>

212
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:03,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he...?</font>

213
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:10,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

214
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:13,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I know you don't
wanna hear what I have to say,</font>

215
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I owe you this.</font>

216
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the moment we first
met, I knew you...</font>

217
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously.</font>

218
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh, Shirley. Ha, ha.
I could have...</font>

219
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:26,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are unbelievable.</font>

220
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not wearing contacts.
These are mine, give them.</font>

221
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm a bag guy.
You have the same bag.</font>

222
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I thought, you know...
Right, nothing is ever your fault.</font>

223
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you.
I don't owe you an apology.</font>

224
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wrote this.</font>

225
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretend like you asleep,
pretend like you asleep.</font>

226
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:48,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, now I fully understand
where I have always stood.</font>

227
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:52,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm entitled to my pride until it gets
in the way of what you guys want.</font>

228
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got nothing to say?</font>

229
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do. I'm out of the group.</font>

230
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Shirley.</font>

231
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:01,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, please.
Oh, Shirley, don't go, please.</font>

232
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh. Sassy black schmitty's
out of the group.</font>

233
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, not the group.</font>

234
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor, sad, little schmitties.</font>

235
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:10,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't all of us little schmitties
get along?</font>

236
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please hurry up?
I am late for my bikini wax.</font>

237
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry, please.
Who was that?</font>

238
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">A punk-ass
who needs to be destroyed.</font>

239
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:19,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just figured out how.</font>

240
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:23,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we focus on what's important here?
Shirley thinks we don't care about her.</font>

241
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, you're right. You're right.
That's totally more important.</font>

242
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:30,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just thought of one thing.
You need to bang that kid's mom.</font>

243
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, after we fix everything
with Shirley.</font>

244
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Yes, yes, yes, we'll deal
with Shirley. But that's brilliant!</font>

245
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know because then anything
he says about you...</font>

246
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:41,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be saying to a dude
that banged his mom.</font>

247
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you guys.</font>

248
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Shirley.
Shirley.</font>

249
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:46,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Yes!</font>

250
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, bye, everybody.
Have a great day.</font>

251
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:10,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right here at 3:00, please.
I'll be in a hurry.</font>

252
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:15,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

253
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to bother you.</font>

254
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:19,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't happen to have an extra
bottle of sports drink, do you?</font>

255
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I do, here you go.</font>

256
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:24,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks, got to hydrate, right?</font>

257
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">But obviously you know.
You work out.</font>

258
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I try to keep things
where they should be.</font>

259
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I might be
where should I be.</font>

260
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about your robot, Abed.</font>

261
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boobatron's great.</font>

262
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once someone spills bong water
on his circuitry and he comes alive,</font>

263
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:44,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's gonna make us the coolest
guys on campus, help us get babes.</font>

264
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are real babes
who will really laugh at us.</font>

265
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you're my friend, right?</font>

266
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends are supposed to help
each other no matter what.</font>

267
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

268
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ridiculous situation descending
into heavy-handed drama</font>

269
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the illusion of story, check.</font>

270
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? That was awesome.</font>

271
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I am back in.
Cool.</font>

272
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:10,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

273
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know, I'm Shirley.</font>

274
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:21,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't want you reaching for me should
you get a hankering for pancakes.</font>

275
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:26,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm old and I do not see well.
And you already won, so shut it.</font>

276
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won? Oh, no,
they want you in the group.</font>

277
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I quit. So you go ahead,
hang with them.</font>

278
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:34,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thanks, I'm sick of the way
that group treats me.</font>

279
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Preaching to the choir.</font>

280
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:39,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what I'm not gonna miss.
Abed and Troy's silly games.</font>

281
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grow up already. Ha.
By the way, thanks for including me.</font>

282
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:47,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. You think Annie and Britta invite me
when they take those weekend trips to the mall?</font>

283
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just think of me
as some sort of mom.</font>

284
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:52,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need to learn manners.
Annie needs to stop dating Vaughn.</font>

285
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:55,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's cute, but he's not the boy
I envisioned her ending up with.</font>

286
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how hard you try, you can
never be as cool or funny as they are.</font>

287
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:02,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called respect
and no one ever gave me diddly.</font>

288
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except me.</font>

289
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I respect you more
than anyone else in the group.</font>

290
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why you pantsed me?</font>

291
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, but you see,
that wasn't wrong.</font>

292
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:16,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for heaven's sake, you are such
an arrogant, self-righteous ass.</font>

293
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are a strong, dignified woman
who's raising a family.</font>

294
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:22,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bigger accomplishment
than anybody else in that room.</font>

295
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:25,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nobody can ever strip you of that,
not even me.</font>

296
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really believe that?
Yes.</font>

297
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why you think
pantsing me wasn't wrong?</font>

298
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't.</font>

299
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:43,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

300
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I misread that?</font>

301
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here, let me just do that.</font>

302
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure
you don't want some vodka?</font>

303
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:54,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm good, I'm good.</font>

304
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm at school at 2:00 p.m.</font>

305
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone just take a schmitty?</font>

306
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, looks like you'll be calling
somebody daddy soon.</font>

307
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or at least your mom will be tonight.</font>

308
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you are so pathetic.
Mark!</font>

309
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, I've been pwning this loser.</font>

310
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks he can get back at me
through you.</font>

311
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:26,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Pwning?
Pwning.</font>

312
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't even know
what that means?</font>

313
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh, heh.
I see what's going on here.</font>

314
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't want to come
between a son</font>

315
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:35,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his beautiful, vivacious mom.</font>

316
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you are pathetic.</font>

317
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so is the whore in on it.</font>

318
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

319
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:46,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta tell you, Chantel, you have
raised a terrible human being.</font>

320
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're better than this.
No, you're not.</font>

321
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I raised a winner who will continue to
crush junior college losers like you.</font>

322
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, schmitty.
Schmitty!</font>

323
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:02,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, it's a matter of pride.</font>

324
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at?
"What are you looking at?" Duh!</font>

325
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What are you looking at?" Duh.</font>

326
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:17,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh!
Ha, ha.</font>

327
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">School his ass, Mark.</font>

328
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">"School his ass, Mark." Duh.</font>

329
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, leh, leh, leh.</font>

330
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh.
Duh, duh, duh!</font>

331
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh. Duh, duh, duh.</font>

332
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are Jeff and Britta making fun
of those handicapped kids?</font>

333
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't even realize
how much they need us.</font>

334
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:11,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they doing this?</font>

335
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:15,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you've noticed, but Jeff and Britta
have the two most fragile egos of the group.</font>

336
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Losing to these kids
will pretty much destroy them.</font>

337
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Whoa!</font>

338
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, a priest?</font>

339
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
What the hell?</font>

340
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you didn't say, "Duh."
We win.</font>

341
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:36,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
You're the schmitties!</font>

342
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:38,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, we're minors.
Yeah.</font>

343
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm calling the cops.</font>

344
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not.</font>

345
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have already embarrassed me
by getting pwned.</font>

346
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be such a girl, now go.</font>

347
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, see that.
Yes, suck it!</font>

348
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:50,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmitty face!</font>

349
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:53,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">We showed you, high schoolers!
Suck it!</font>

350
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:56,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations
on your victory.</font>

351
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Annie.
Yeah, thank you.</font>

352
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:01,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thanks, you guys.
Any time.</font>

353
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:04,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Pierce and I are
considering rejoining the group.</font>

354
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:07,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe we can all be
a little more mature.</font>

355
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear that.</font>

356
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I've had enough
of this list.</font>

357
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doing this stuff isn't fun.
It feels forced.</font>

358
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, I'll deactivate Boobatron.</font>

359
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:19,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, classic college experiences
never happen organically.</font>

360
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Food fight!
Food fight!</font>

361
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

362
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:29,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure it's the name of my grade
school and my favorite soft drink?</font>

363
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:33,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, pretty sure.
George Washington Lemon Fresco.</font>

364
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:35,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a horrible porn name.</font>

365
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't make the rules.
What's yours?</font>

366
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:39,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Henry David Thoreau Diet Squirt.
Oh, that's good.</font>

367
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:41,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Henry David Thoreau
Diet Squirt.</font>

368
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many pornos have you been in?
Six thousand and 12.</font>

369
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:48,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many pornos have you been in?
Two thousand and 19.</font>

370
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my first week.
Impressive.</font>

371
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
You're welcome.</font>

372
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone here order a pizza?</font>

373
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:58,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it you guys?</font>

374
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has extra sausage.</font>

375
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

376
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's big and hot.
That's my pizza.</font>

377
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you took longer than 30 minutes
so I'm not paying.</font>
