<font color="#FFFFFF">Has this always been here?</font>

295
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to take Jeff back.</font>

296
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,783

don't want him, especially now.</font>

297

What am I supposed to do?</font>

302
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use your lady parts.
Abed.</font>

303
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be naive. The charge between
you two is keeping him going.</font>

304
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,094

a shower and finds a nice place to live.</font>

305
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm heading back.
Pavel's making bobka.</font>

than that family on Good Times?</i></font>

319
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but they had good times.
Do good times really matter?</font>

320
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about good cars,
good lobster?</font>

321
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about that sport where
the British people ride the horses</font>

322
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,857

<font color="#FFFFFF">But for you?</font>

326
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're one of those rare people
with nothing underneath the surface.</font>

327
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe if you put stain remover
on a turd, you don't get a diamond.</font>

328
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just get a turd
with less direction in life.</font>

329
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, coach.
Can you turn the TV back on?</font>
