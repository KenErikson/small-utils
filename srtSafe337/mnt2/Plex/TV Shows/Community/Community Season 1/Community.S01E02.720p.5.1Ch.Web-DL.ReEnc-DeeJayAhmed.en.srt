00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:15,701

should be smiling,</i></font>

6
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:17,879
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but I suppose
that's a matter of opinion.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>More on that story as it unfolds.</i></font>

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dude makes
a lot of announcements.</font>

17
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it. It makes every 10 minutes
feel like a new scene of a TV show.</font>

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">The illusion lasts until someone says
something they never say on TV,</font>

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">like how much life is like TV.
There, it's gone.</font>

20
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:59,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess Jeff's running late again.
Oh. What a shame.</font>

21
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should get started...
No, no, no.</font>

22
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:04,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we should wait for
Jeff before we start studying.</font>

23
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:09,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when Jeff gets here, we could talk
to him, as a group, about his tardiness.</font>

24
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:12,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on now.
Don't use that word around Abed.</font>

25
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want me to have
a chat with Jeff, I'd do it.</font>

26
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a bond going, kind of,
sort of like brothers.</font>

27
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope your mom didn't make
you take baths together.</font>

28
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because one of you
would have been like 30.</font>

29
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha, ha, ha.
That's funny.</font>

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff probably comes late so he doesn't
have to sit through your tardiness.</font>

31
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:28,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Abed.</font>

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, will you guys have
some self-respect?</font>

33
00:01:31,186 --> 00:01:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are obsessing over someone who
does not give you a second thought.</font>

34
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:37,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are
being killed by their own government.</font>

35
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:40,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You jumped a column there.
What's happening in Guatemala?</font>

36
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.
Journalists are being murdered?</font>

37
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:47,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, every day in that country,
people are killed for speaking out.</font>

38
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">The worst part of it is,
when it's all over,</font>

39
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:52,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spoilers.
It's as if it never happened.</font>

40
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:57,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed, real stories,
they don't have spoilers.</font>

41
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand that TV and
life are different, right?</font>

42
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, baby.
Hi, sweetie.</font>

43
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smell nice. Vitamin P.</font>

44
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, Jeffrey.
People were jazzed to see me too.</font>

45
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word them up.
Word them everywhere.</font>

46
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:18,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good entrance. Thank you.
It was for you.</font>

47
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

48
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff.</font>

49
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:28,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's something that the
group would like to talk to you about.</font>

50
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, there's nothing more to say.
Nice jacket.</font>

51
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're gonna study
with people,</font>

52
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would be cool of you
to show up on time.</font>

53
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Were you waiting?
No.</font>

54
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:38,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got here.
No.</font>

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys spend the first 20 minutes
talking about your interesting lives</font>

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your cool emotional problems.</font>

57
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like
I never have anything to offer.</font>

58
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh.</font>

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Truth is, my life is emptier
than this three-ring binder.</font>

60
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:56,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, do you have any Spanish
notes that might fit in there?</font>

61
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:58,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Double-spaced.
Thank you.</font>

62
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's a guy gotta do
to get a C around here?</font>

63
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:04,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the one.</font>

64
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:34,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good study.</font>

65
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for good study.
See you later.</font>

66
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know what today is?</font>

67
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two-week anniversary
of my horrible first impression.</font>

68
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a card for that?
Well, not specifically.</font>

69
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you think of grandsons
as metaphors for friendship,</font>

70
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:49,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll agree with
this Transformer here</font>

71
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:52,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it's time for ours to become
a man by reading from the Torah.</font>

72
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Jeff,
you're harmless enough to me.</font>

73
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:57,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">A life full of ups and downs
has given me douche-ray vision.</font>

74
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">But those are good people in there,
and they trust and respect you,</font>

75
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">and watching you exploit them
bums me out.</font>

76
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exploit them? They're my friends.
Can I bring your car around?</font>

77
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Abed, I don't want you
bring my car around.</font>

78
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:13,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring yours around, good guy.
You get going, all right?</font>

79
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're cute but selfish,</font>

80
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">and narcissistic to the point
of near-delusion.</font>

81
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said I was cute.
Tell you what. You take her.</font>

82
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have less to prove.</font>

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Jeff, you can't
pursue people so desperately.</font>

84
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:30,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">It starts to creep them out.</font>

85
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we get a beer?
I'll give you advice,</font>

86
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can have what the kids
are calling a sausage fest.</font>

87
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:39,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not much of a sausage guy,
Pierce. Maybe next time.</font>

88
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time then.</font>

89
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:43,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

90
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you tell us more
about Guatemala?</font>

91
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be political.</font>

92
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good. You should discover
that stuff on your own.</font>

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your help.</font>

94
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:56,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been living on the wrong
side of the looking glass.</font>

95
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like Jodie Foster
or Susan Sarandon.</font>

96
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd rather keep it real
than be likeable.</font>

97
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you at least tell us
what to Google?</font>

98
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could start with the
journalist Chacata-Panecos.</font>

99
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:07,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wrote an article critical of the
government and they killed him.</font>

100
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
That's horrible.</font>

101
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:10,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we have a protest?</font>

102
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:11,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna protest the hell
out of something.</font>

103
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">A candlelight vigil, like
lesbians on the news.</font>

104
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could make brownies.</font>

105
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brownies?</font>

106
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every once in a while,
a student will ask:</font>

107
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Señor Chang,
why do you teach Spanish?"</font>

108
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say it just like that.</font>

109
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:33,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why do you teach Spanish?"</font>

110
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why you.</font>

111
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not math?</font>

112
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:45,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not photography?</font>

113
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not martial arts?</font>

114
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:53,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, surely it must be
in my nature to instruct you</font>

115
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:56,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">in something that's ancient
and secret</font>

116
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:59,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, oh, building a wall that
you can see from outer space.</font>

117
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:04,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll tell you why I teach Spanish.
It is none of your business, okay?</font>

118
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:08,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't wanna have
any conversations about what</font>

119
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">a mysterious, inscrutable man I am.</font>

120
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a Spanish genius.</font>

121
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:24,571
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In español my nickname is
El Tigre Chino.</i></font>

122
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because my knowledge
will bite her face off.</font>

123
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:37,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't question Señor Chang
or you'll get bit.</font>

124
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:41,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, bit. Yeah, bit.</font>

125
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,135
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay, Friday mañana,
we'll be having conversations</i></font>

126
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the rest of the class, using
some phrases we learned in unit one.</font>

127
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You'll be partnering up
in pairs of dos.</i></font>

128
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh.</font>

129
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you look under your desk,</font>

130
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:03,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will find a card with either
a picture or a word on it, okay?</font>

131
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:05,351
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Por ejemplo, Blondie, aqui,</i></font>

132
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">has a card with a picture
of a house on it.</font>

133
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:10,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that means the person
with the card</font>

134
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,756
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>with the word "casa" on it
is her partner.</i></font>

135
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,795
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Comprende, Star-Burns?</i></font>

136
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:21,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, see you Friday, find your
partners, have a great day.</font>

137
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:24,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do we say
at the end of every class?</font>

138
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, hands.
Ninety percent of Spanish.</font>

139
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:37,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Abed, do you want to trade cards?</font>

140
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:39,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I'll give you 20 bucks.</font>

141
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

142
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:43,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty bucks.
No.</font>

143
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:46,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want money. I want your shirt.
What?</font>

144
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had my eye on it
since registration day.</font>

145
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:50,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Give me your card.</font>

146
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you understand.
I wanna wear it out of here.</font>

147
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:56,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

148
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are the odds?</font>

149
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you didn't
adjust the odds?</font>

150
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Abed's been eyeing
that shirt for three weeks.</font>

151
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost like you gave it to him
so he would switch cards.</font>

152
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:09,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave Abed my shirt
because I'm not selfish.</font>

153
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:14,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is something I guess you'll
finally discover while we work on this.</font>

154
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:16,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow night?
Dinner, drinks?</font>

155
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's something that we
should discuss with our partners.</font>

156
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, see, I did switch cards.</font>

157
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe this?
What are the odds? Heh, heh.</font>

158
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a nice shirt. Wanna sell it?
Yes.</font>

159
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the moist towelette
industry like? Oh.</font>

160
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me,
it's nothing like the product.</font>

161
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:43,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's a hard,
dry, large business.</font>

162
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:44,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroyed all my marriages.</font>

163
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't help any
that I can't have children.</font>

164
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sterile. In fact it's a rare
condition called hyper-virility.</font>

165
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:55,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently my sperm shoot through
the egg like bullets. Heh.</font>

166
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:59,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe that?
I can't. But you can, so that's fine.</font>

167
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:03,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the assignment is to write
a Spanish conversation</font>

168
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:06,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">using those five phrases that...
Ooh.</font>

169
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hemingway's lemonade.</font>

170
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:10,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to make this
a long evening.</font>

171
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I,
a piece of garbage to you?</font>

172
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

173
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:22,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got you. Hey, come on, let's
have one drink before we work.</font>

174
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, mm, mm.</font>

175
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the empowerage of words.</font>

176
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:34,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the irony of that sentence.</font>

177
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's up with you?</font>

178
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:39,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like you got a burr
up your ass or something.</font>

179
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess that it's, uh...
I think it's Britta.</font>

180
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:47,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget Britta. All you have to
know about her is her name.</font>

181
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:50,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is she, a water filter?
I mean, heh, heh, she's ugly.</font>

182
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

183
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,586
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why don't we start
with me saying, donde...</i></font>

184
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing?
Our assignment.</font>

185
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no.</font>

186
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:03,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first time people are gonna
see Winger and Hawthorne together.</font>

187
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna show them
we're to be reckoned with.</font>

188
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
let's brainstorm some story ideas.</font>

189
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:14,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better yet, before we do that,
let's ask ourselves...</font>

190
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is a story?
Oh, my God in heaven.</font>

191
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:24,642
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Guatemala, we hate</i></font>

192
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:27,446
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Guatemala, we hate</i></font>

193
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:31,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you like that brownie, you're gonna hate
what's going on in Guatemala. Google it.</font>

194
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, hey.
Hi.</font>

195
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Raise the truth.</font>

196
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:37,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, once it gets dark,
I hand out the candles,</font>

197
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we do what's called
a speechless protest.</font>

198
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">We put tape over our mouths
and gather hand in hand</font>

199
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a sea of outraged silence.</font>

200
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-Burns, no, no.</font>

201
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:56,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gotten into you?
This is not how you do this.</font>

202
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not how you do it.
We're doing everything.</font>

203
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:01,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is tacky and lame.</font>

204
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.</font>

205
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:09,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I meant to say was that this
cause is really personal to me.</font>

206
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:13,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that
we're not allowed to protest?</font>

207
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you sound like Guatemala.</font>

208
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody has a case of
"use fringe politics</font>

209
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:21,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make themselves feel special
but doesn't ever do anything."</font>

210
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:24,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Itis.
No, I do things. I...</font>

211
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to...</font>

212
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't do anything.</font>

213
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:33,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do?</font>

214
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can hang the
Chacata-Panecos piñata.</font>

215
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys realize
he was beaten to death, right?</font>

216
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:43,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where we got the idea from.
Poignant.</font>

217
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

218
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:52,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, tell me what I've got so far.
What we have so far?</font>

219
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:55,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we have something
incredibly long</font>

220
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">and very confusing,
and a little homophobic.</font>

221
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And really, really,
specifically, surprisingly</font>

222
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:03,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gratuitously critical
of Israel.</font>

223
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,113
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's called "Two Conquistadors.
" Should be dos.</i></font>

224
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it is Spanish class.
Oh, which reminds me.</font>

225
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing not included
in this epic</font>

226
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the five phrases required
to get me a passing grade.</font>

227
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. Needs more work.</font>

228
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing?
I have no idea.</font>

229
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're headed to the demonstration.
Hippies?</font>

230
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some cause Britta's into.
It's a silent protest, lots of candles.</font>

231
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gets the ladies in the mood for social
change, if you know what I mean.</font>

232
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good chance to put
some miles on this shirt.</font>

233
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:33,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize these conversations
are due in the morning, don't you?</font>

234
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Right.</font>

235
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you wanna do?</font>

236
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tsk. Hacks. Okay, what do we do
about the ending of act two?</font>

237
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:57,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We are gonna take this</font>

238
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:00,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna put it
in a museum for crazy people.</font>

239
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we're going to take this
and memorize five phrases from it</font>

240
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:08,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">tomorrow morning before class.
Good night.</font>

241
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. You're bailing
on our first sausage fest?</font>

242
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:14,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your definition of friendship?
No, this is my definition</font>

243
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">of you trying way too hard</font>

244
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:19,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">and me finding it harder
and harder to stay polite.</font>

245
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a fine enough way to
spend an evening devoid of hope,</font>

246
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:25,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the woman I kind of like
is out in the moonlight</font>

247
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">caring about something stupid.</font>

248
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is my chance to show her that I
care enough to act like I care about it too.</font>

249
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you had to say, Jeff.</font>

250
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was it? Oh.</font>

251
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would have been great
if I had done that two hours ago.</font>

252
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice sign.
Thanks.</font>

253
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like what you've done
with the place.</font>

254
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:31,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think was a little too harsh on you.
I'm not perfect.</font>

255
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am. I'd be happy
to show you the ropes.</font>

256
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

257
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.</font>

258
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:42,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too awesome for old Pierce</font>

259
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your hip shirts
and your gelled hair</font>

260
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:50,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your cool tape
over your mouth.</font>

261
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:53,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is everybody wearing
tape over their mouth?</font>

262
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a protest, Pierce.</font>

263
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:56,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good.</font>

264
00:14:56,857 --> 00:15:00,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I know what I'd like to protest.
How much you hurt me.</font>

265
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:03,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conflicts like these will ultimately
bring us together as an unlikely family.</font>

266
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have horrible breath
right now.</font>

267
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, you constantly blow me off,</font>

268
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you want me to do
your homework.</font>

269
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:13,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you tell me I'm trying too hard
to be your friend so you have to go.</font>

270
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had to come out here
to pretend to care</font>

271
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the stupid stuff
she cares about.</font>

272
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">His words, not mine.
He is paraphrasing.</font>

273
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got an idea.
Why don't you go get a cup of coffee</font>

274
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hold some waitress hostage
with a monologue about sperm.</font>

275
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you some sperm,
buddy.</font>

276
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:33,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your idea?
What the hell?</font>

277
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire.</font>

278
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not ready to die.</font>

279
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh. He's...</font>

280
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's jumped in the fountain.</font>

281
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:46,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fine.
Please call 911.</font>

282
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen it?
We did it, girl. Page three.</font>

283
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about Pierce,
but listen to that paragraph.</font>

284
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:59,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The incident occurred during a protest
regarding events in Guatemala."</font>

285
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awareness.
This isn't the school paper.</font>

286
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a real damn newspaper.
There's a Marmaduke in here.</font>

287
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more than I ever accomplished.</font>

288
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know about
ethnic cleansing in Burma?</font>

289
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to bust out
that brownie mix.</font>

290
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning.
Morning.</font>

291
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I get it.</font>

292
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor
Day, and you'd like a fresh start.</font>

293
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try.
It's actually Secretaries Day.</font>

294
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:26,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says that I'm sorry
about crashing your protest</font>

295
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">with that drunken,
self-immolating baby boomer.</font>

296
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't blame you.
Pierce has been on my watch list.</font>

297
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dude is crazy.
He told me girls have two pee holes.</font>

298
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sang Christmas carols
at a nursing home once.</font>

299
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen the face of dementia,
and last night, I saw it again.</font>

300
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:43,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what he did
that's really crazy?</font>

301
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">He offered me a 100 dollars
to switch cards with him</font>

302
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:49,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so he could be partners
with Jeff.</font>

303
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:54,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he thought getting closer to Jeff
would bring him respect in the group.</font>

304
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he spent his whole life
looking out for himself,</font>

305
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he would trade it all
for a shot at some kind of family.</font>

306
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,698
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hola, class.</i></font>

307
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, time
for our presentations.</font>

308
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">First up was supposed
to be Jeff and Pierce,</font>

309
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Pierce explained
the situation to me.</font>

310
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a falling out,
things were said,</font>

311
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">people were betrayed.</font>

312
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:22,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

313
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, having
heard Pierce's side of the story,</font>

314
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">the thing to do
would be to give you a C</font>

315
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let Pierce do
his presentation alone.</font>

316
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that sounds fair to you.</font>

317
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't sound fair
to me at all.</font>

318
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand if you don't
wanna be my friend.</font>

319
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:46,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this thing that we've created,
it is bigger than the both of us,</font>

320
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:50,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it deserves to be done right.</font>

321
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

322
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, um, guys, why are
there costumes involved?</font>

323
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are short conversations.
They're not supposed to take...</font>

324
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your breath away?</font>

325
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:04,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, tough.</font>

326
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:06,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready, amigo?</font>

327
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:32,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">F, F-minus.</font>

328
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

329
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you say S?</font>

330
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:42,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

331
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:46,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was one of the worst
things I have ever seen.</font>

332
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:49,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I guess makes being a part
of it a pretty selfless act.</font>

333
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm impressed.</font>

334
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:54,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know I didn't do it
just to get another shot at you?</font>

335
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">A smart guy like you would know
that no woman in that class</font>

336
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:01,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be able to look at you as a
sexually viable candidate ever again.</font>

337
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:07,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I know. I thought of that.</font>

338
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looked back.</font>

339
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:14,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did an all right job up there,
my friend.</font>

340
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Pierce.</font>

341
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:16,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">A couple of notes.</font>

342
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got this thing you do with your
face when you're trying to be funny</font>

343
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">that forces people to think
about how cool you think you are.</font>

344
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, boy, boy.</font>

345
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
What.</font>

346
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 2009.
Word.</font>
