before winter break, Greendale.</i></font>

00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:05,197
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Time to visit our loved ones.</i></font>

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,096
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Some of you will travel
as far as three miles.</i></font>

00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:12,701
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland,
where we're giving away catalogues</i></font>

5
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:15,035
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>of next semester's classes.
Ha-ha-ha!</i></font>

6
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! What's that sound?</font>

7
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the tippy-tapping
of secular boots on the roof?</font>

8
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:29,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, it must be yet another sign
that it 'tis the season,</font>

9
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">because rumor has it</font>

10
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:35,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">that non-denominational
Mr. Winter</font>

11
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">is on his way
to the student lounge.</font>

12
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sick of the dean jamming
his PCness down my throat.</font>

13
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:46,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I'd like to commend you
for letting that one go.</font>

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">PCness. Now I get it.</font>

15
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds like penis.
I just got it too.</font>

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's still Christmas to all of us.</font>

17
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:57,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I made you all a little gift,
because you're like my new family.</font>

18
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:59,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">"W.W.B.J. D?"</font>

19
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that stands for
"What would Billy Joel do?"</font>

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you right now,
he'd write another crappy song.</font>

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.</font>

22
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,328
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who is that?</i></font>

23
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:09,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?
" And it's to remind us</font>

24
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the real meaning
of this season is Christmas.</font>

25
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, thank you, Shirley.</font>

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna put that in the pocket
closest to my heart.</font>

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
It's a bracelet, you put them on.</font>

28
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody put them on.</font>

29
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:34,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey.</font>

30
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took all the Winter-Doodles.</font>

31
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, a douche bag?</font>

32
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're for my friends.
But there's a lot left.</font>

33
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:44,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Only macadamia nut cookies.
I have a tree-nut allergy.</font>

34
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should stay away from
Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.</font>

35
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:50,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha-ha! That did not even make allergic sense.
What are you, an idiot?</font>

36
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:55,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we get it, you and the A-Team
are awesome, now beat it.</font>

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at that. Pretty boy,
standing up for bird-face over here.</font>

38
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:00,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a Winter-Doodle.</font>

39
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:04,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're trying to be menacing, maybe
don't call the cookie by its name.</font>

40
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:08,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're funny, you're a funny man.
Wanna hear something funny?</font>

41
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock, knock. My fist up your balls.</font>

42
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:19,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Merry happy.</font>

43
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ain't over.</font>

44
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:25,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't always be
a dean around, all right?</font>

45
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still waiting on
those cookies, Abed.</font>

46
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:57,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff protected my honor.</font>

47
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,736
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was like My Bodyguard,
but I was the kid from Meatballs,</i></font>

48
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:03,206
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff was from Full Metal Jacket, and the mustache
guy was the brother of the guy in Entourage.</i></font>

49
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for dumbing that down for us.
You got it.</font>

50
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the deal, Jeff? You leave
your stones in your other suit?</font>

51
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you rap that guy
in the face?</font>

52
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:14,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the same reason that I floss
and keep my guitar in its case.</font>

53
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:15,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm over 23.</font>

54
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm proud of you for
handling it peacefully, Jeff.</font>

55
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:21,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a certain little birthday boy.
Heh-heh-heh.</font>

56
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:24,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real men turn the other cheek.
Let's see them.</font>

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nonsense. Men were wired
to fight each other</font>

58
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">so women could choose
the right mate.</font>

59
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:33,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the real reason men fight
is to release their pent-up gayness.</font>

60
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy wasn't gay,
he had a mustache.</font>

61
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:37,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I have? Finals.</font>

62
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we cramming
for Spanish or not?</font>

63
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a 65
or I'm gonna flunk the class.</font>

64
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you do the extra credit
if you knew that you were</font>

65
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:46,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">failing?</font>

66
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because doing more than the
minimum work is my definition of</font>

67
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">failing.</font>

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick question.</font>

69
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all coming to my
Christmas party right after the final</font>

70
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are you stopping home to
change into your Christmas outfits?</font>

71
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I could wear
one of my Hanukkah sweaters.</font>

72
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:09,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Annie, I didn't know
you weren't, um, Christian.</font>

73
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:13,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep, one might
even say I'm Jewish.</font>

74
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's good for you.
That's wonderful.</font>

75
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:17,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I respect all religions of the world.</font>

76
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Muslim.
Jehovah's Witness.</font>

77
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Atheist.
The Lord is testing me.</font>

78
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:25,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is a subject that
breeds conflict, can we please...?</font>

79
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">What religion are you, Jeff?
I'm agnostic.</font>

80
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:31,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agnostic. Lazy man's atheist.</font>

81
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:34,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm born-again.
Oh!</font>

82
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had are-birthing ritual
in my friend's hot tub.</font>

83
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:41,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm now a level five Laser Lotus
in my Buddhist community.</font>

84
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">That does not sound like Buddhism.
You sure you're not in a cult?</font>

85
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:49,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just by asking me that question,
you put me back down to a level four.</font>

86
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You now owe me
2000 Energon Cubes.</font>

87
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:54,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how foolish
you sound right now?</font>

88
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:56,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else do you believe in,
blood transfusions?</font>

89
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jehovah's Witnesses are
a type of Christian, right, Troy?</font>

90
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:04,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays
or Christmas, and we can't drink.</font>

91
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it helps.</font>

92
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:06,660
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So you're like a Muslim.
Assalamu alaikum.</i></font>

93
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shama-lama-ding-dong.</font>

94
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't we have
a diverse little family.</font>

95
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we open up this party
to all faiths.</font>

96
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought my Star of Bethlehem,</font>

97
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">which led the wise men
to the savior of all mankind.</font>

98
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:22,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you guys can bring a little trinket
or doodad from your philosophies.</font>

99
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:23,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds good?</font>

100
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:26,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an agnostic, I'm gonna
bring my winning smile.</font>

101
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! So boring.</font>

102
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done. Hee, hee!</font>

103
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Feliz navidad.</i></font>

104
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,938
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>"True or falso
or none of the above?"</i></font>

105
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make any sense.</font>

106
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:03,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look at that,
Forehead's taking a test.</font>

107
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you get going,
Chuck Norris?</font>

108
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:09,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just shoo me?
Why don't you just kiss him already?</font>

109
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:12,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I will shoo your nose
down your throat.</font>

110
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:15,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Señor Chang, can you do
something about this?</font>

111
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll allow it.</font>

112
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Qué pasa here, huh?</i></font>

113
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,908
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's usted, dude. Even I know that.</i></font>

114
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You picked the wrong day to correct
my Spanish, No Sleeves. It's on.</font>

115
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:33,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's doing this for me.
He's my bodyguard.</font>

116
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:34,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna dance?
To some show tunes?</font>

117
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I want to beat you,
and I'm gonna enjoy it.</font>

118
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're like this school.</font>

119
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:42,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're obnoxious, cramping my style
and you smell like french-fry oil.</font>

120
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:43,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

121
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three o'clock. Bike rack,
but not the one by the parking lot.</font>

122
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:50,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, the one by the trash cans, near the orange
cones, where they're building the wheelchair ramp.</font>

123
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Best exam ever.</font>

124
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:56,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's awesome.</font>

125
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">So help me, if that
jerkweed made me fail.</font>

126
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, I aced it, amigo.
That means cousin.</i></font>

127
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:07,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's my role going to be?</font>

128
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a key moment where
I stand up for myself, take revenge?</font>

129
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, maybe you should
just hang back.</font>

130
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I will. In his face.</font>

131
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you do,
don't tell Shirley about the fight.</font>

132
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll start in with all her
mothery guilt-inducing powers.</font>

133
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean?
No.</font>

134
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet
because it gets me chicks.</font>

135
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know guys like this Mike.</font>

136
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used to be a nerd,
now he's a meathead.</font>

137
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:29,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dangerous combo.</font>

138
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyson, Lou Ferrigno,
Rosie O'Donnell.</font>

139
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a pretty big dude.
You've probably got moves.</font>

140
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got some theories.</font>

141
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:40,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never been in a fight?
Technically, no.</font>

142
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:44,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm too charming
and likeable. Call me a name.</font>

143
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.
Mm.</font>

144
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you telling me you've never
been punched in the face?</font>

145
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank God.
This is the moneymaker.</font>

146
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time I got punched in the face,
I was like, "Oh, no."</font>

147
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:58,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I was like, "This is a story."</font>

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a good one.
Yeah.</font>

149
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:03,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man should be punched
in the face. It's a rite of passage.</font>

150
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:06,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my day, Friday night was
smoke a doobie, feel up a gal</font>

151
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then get your teeth
knocked out by a Republican.</font>

152
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:12,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, the plan here isn't for me
to get hit. It's for me to hit him.</font>

153
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:13,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, then it's settled.</font>

154
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to teach Jeffrey
how to fight.</font>

155
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:17,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a few moves.</font>

156
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I assume you're
handy with a switchblade.</font>

157
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:23,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you get back to the family tent,
try to find a chicken for Jeff to chase.</font>

158
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but I think I got this.</font>

159
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, look who it is.</font>

160
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got Forehead, Old Head,
Dumb Head and the Other Head.</font>

161
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at 3, Forehead.</font>

162
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a snowman, dork.</font>

163
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">See this, funny guy? Huh?</font>

164
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

165
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Classic Rosie.</font>

166
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:54,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight lessons in a half an hour?</font>

167
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good plan.</font>

168
00:08:56,464 --> 00:09:01,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Joy to the
world The Lord is come ♪</font>

169
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:07,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ The Lord, the Lord, the Lord ♪♪</font>

170
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

171
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Is this your Hanukkah holder?</font>

172
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's, uh... It's pretty.</font>

173
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just, uh... Let's just put it here.</font>

174
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go. That's nice.</font>

175
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:23,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can't believe
I never knew you were a Jew.</font>

176
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say the whole word next time.</font>

177
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:32,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you think everyone
will start arriving soon?</font>

178
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they're gonna come
after Jeff's fight.</font>

179
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:36,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">After Jeff's what, now?</font>

180
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:39,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff wants to fight that bully.</font>

181
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Christmas?</font>

182
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:43,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you excuse me for a moment?</font>

183
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:47,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you finish the manger scene?</font>

184
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:51,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you were one of us.</font>

185
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up? What's up?</font>

186
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:01,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up.
No, it's a question.</font>

187
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?
What's up?</font>

188
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:07,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a real question, a rhetorical one.
You have the answer, he does not.</font>

189
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you give them
the Forest Whitaker eye.</font>

190
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's pretty good.</font>

191
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, hold that stare.
There you go.</font>

192
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:17,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it. Then, look straight through
his eyes and deep into his soul.</font>

193
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you move to Vermont.</font>

194
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick and tired of you
saying that fighting is gay.</font>

195
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's got a point. In boxing,
you fight for the purse and a belt.</font>

196
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:27,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta write a paper about that.
Let's see what we're working with.</font>

197
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead,
throw a few at the old paws.</font>

198
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you?
A North Korean seamstress?</font>

199
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:37,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if that's bad.
Get mad, come on!</font>

200
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:39,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it helps, think of me
as somebody who annoys you.</font>

201
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:42,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. That's good.</font>

202
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, put your blouse back on.</font>

203
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:46,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh! Ow!</font>

204
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a game.
You gotta be ready for anything.</font>

205
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, that is not cool.</font>

206
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that foxy black girl thinks it is.
Hm?</font>

207
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:54,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

208
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:57,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Why she have to be black?</font>

209
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on?</font>

210
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:04,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to get Jeff
ready for the fight.</font>

211
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't think of another word.</font>

212
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:09,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot.</font>

213
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">He meant we were figh...</font>

214
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">ting. It is hard to
think of another word.</font>

215
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize there's
no way to take this</font>

216
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:19,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">than as a giant middle finger to
the most important day of the year.</font>

217
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">December 10th?
It's our Christmas.</font>

218
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm having a party.</font>

219
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Due to my divorce,
and my relatives picking sides,</font>

220
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">this will be the only Christmas party
I throw this year.</font>

221
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:30,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you be there</font>

222
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">or will I have another family
letting me down?</font>

223
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him not to fight.</font>

224
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't listen.</font>

225
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that is.</font>

226
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I have two boys.</font>

227
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when we have
a serious discussion,</font>

228
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find that a brownie
helps them to relax.</font>

229
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why do you hate me and Jesus?</font>

230
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:59,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think my brownie's working.</font>

231
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't do something so ugly
on a day so important to me.</font>

232
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:04,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, it's December 10th.</font>

233
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think religion is stupid.</font>

234
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:10,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. To me,
religion is like Paul Rudd.</font>

235
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:13,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see the appeal and would never
take it away from anyone,</font>

236
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:15,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I would also never
stand in line for it.</font>

237
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, look, the die has been cast
with this crazy bully guy.</font>

238
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:21,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">He picked on Abed,
and he corrected my Spanish.</font>

239
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you go to your party
and I'll see you soon.</font>

240
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.</font>

241
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you don't get to.
You're not my mom.</font>

242
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:35,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, but if you show up for
the fight, don't show up for my party.</font>

243
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
I'm not mad, I'm disappointed.</font>

244
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:41,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Mom for mad.</font>

245
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hash browns and
applesauce, that's nice.</font>

246
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what is that interesting smell?</font>

247
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a traditional Muslim dish.</font>

248
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks delicious.</font>

249
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing as a woman
I won't be allowed to eat that.</font>

250
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's too bad.</font>

251
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, Britta brought
what she believes in.</font>

252
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:07,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

253
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where should I put
my Buddha incense holder?</font>

254
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure that's a bong.</font>

255
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Jeff?</font>

256
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess he made his choice.</font>

257
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna go to Jeff's fight.</font>

258
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I told Jeff, no one that goes
to the fight can come to my party.</font>

259
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:28,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead to me. And if any of you
leave you'll be dead to me too.</font>

260
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's sing.</font>

261
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:33,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪</font>

262
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪</font>

263
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody.</font>

264
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:38,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪♪</font>

265
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:40,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everybody.
You don't know it?</font>

266
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:44,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're banning Jeff from the party?
That doesn't seem very Christian.</font>

267
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:49,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's an interesting point
of view coming from an atheist.</font>

268
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:52,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did my best to create
a special Christmas</font>

269
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my one intact family.</font>

270
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, ahem, this is the thanks I get?</font>

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, you are a guilt machine.
Mm.</font>

272
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:04,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Annie knows a thing or two
about guilt, am I right, Jew?</font>

273
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say the whole word.</font>

274
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:09,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jewie?</font>

275
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:12,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would never catch
a Jehovah's Witness saying "Jewie."</font>

276
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell it to the birthday cake
you never got.</font>

277
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there's an
old Buddhist saying...</font>

278
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:19,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not a Buddhist,
you are in a cult.</font>

279
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:20,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suck it, Nietzsche.</font>

280
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:24,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, everyone's faith is weird.
Let's just not talk about it.</font>

281
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys.</font>

282
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:37,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys, are we really gonna
let religion divide us like this?</font>

283
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's one thing
we can all agree on.</font>

284
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get 72 virgins in heaven.</font>

285
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that we would all like
to have Jeff at this party.</font>

286
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. He can't come. Mm-mm.
Shirley.</font>

287
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:51,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get that this is your first Christmas
since your husband left you.</font>

288
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:55,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know, maybe that's why
you're being so stubborn,</font>

289
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:58,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're trying so hard
to recreate something</font>

290
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're afraid
that you've lost forever.</font>

291
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:03,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you really want us
to be your second family,</font>

292
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you've gotta start
treating us like one.</font>

293
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:08,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if that means supporting us</font>

294
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:11,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we do things
that you don't agree with.</font>

295
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:14,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can start
by rooting for Jeff</font>

296
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">while he rolls around on the ground,
groping another man.</font>

297
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm gonna do.</font>

298
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cranberry sauce
has real cranberries.</font>

299
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this dude doesn't show up,
we're definitely going to Applebee's.</font>

300
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:43,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm getting into a fight
no matter what today, I'm telling you.</font>

301
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look who showed up.</font>

302
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, check him out. Ohh!</font>

303
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, dude?</font>

304
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">No backup today, huh?</font>

305
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:57,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't
show up to get their teeth knocked out.</font>

306
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you a question? Are you
perpetually on your way to the gym?</font>

307
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:02,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, my life is a gym.</font>

308
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what's up? What's up?
What's up, man?</font>

309
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up?</font>

310
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?
What's up?</font>

311
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?
What's up? What's up?</font>

312
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:12,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

313
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:17,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what is that?
One sec, these are very expensive.</font>

314
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:19,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is he doing?</font>

315
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

316
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you wear a bracelet?</font>

317
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name is Mike, right?
So?</font>

318
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:35,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, I'm not gonna fight you.</font>

319
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a friend that believes this is the time of year
where you put aside your differences and make peace.</font>

320
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:44,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? I don't believe in any of that,
but I do believe in friendship.</font>

321
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:47,830
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And as much as I hate you
and the cast of Breakin',</i></font>

322
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:50,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to ask myself,
what would Shirley do?</font>

323
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:54,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
What would Shirley do?</font>

324
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:58,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that she would
shake your hand</font>

325
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wish you a Merry Christmas.</font>

326
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

327
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick his ass.</font>

328
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cavalry's here. Shirts off, boys.</font>

329
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:11,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'm being punk'd, right?</font>

330
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:13,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick them. Come here.</font>

331
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:43,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, it's Christmas.
It's December 10th.</font>

332
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:44,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

333
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the moneymaker,
not the moneymaker.</font>

334
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:49,090

00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

362
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:24,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Spanish 102, ha-ha-ha!
Because he passed, you know.</font>

363
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,558

Yay!</font>

364
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:29,320

366
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

367
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, Mike got you good.</font>

368
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:39,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, that was
my present to Jeff.</font>

369
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,173

I've got a mountain to shred.</font>

How does it feel?</font>

371
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:50,481
