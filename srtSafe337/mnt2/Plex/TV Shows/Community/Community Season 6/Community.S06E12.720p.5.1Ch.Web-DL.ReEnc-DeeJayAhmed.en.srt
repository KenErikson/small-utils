00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what are you doing?</font>

2
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:09,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freelancing.</font>

3
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:11,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a spy for
the city, are you?</font>

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been sending footage
of my classroom and</font>

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:17,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">pronounced me no worse than
the teachers that work hard.</font>

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you who
I'm working for.</font>

7
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a surprise.</font>

8
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:22,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't get in the way.</font>

9
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the rules, Jeff.</font>

10
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sooner you ignore me, the
sooner I stop being a factor.</font>

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:26,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, people.</font>

12
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:32,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday I wrote the
word law on the board.</font>

13
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:37,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time, don't erase it, and maybe
tomorrow we'll get even further.</font>

14
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:41,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm told Garrett has prepared
a presentation for extra credit.</font>

15
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:43,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, everyone in class gets
the credit because I'm not sure how</font>

16
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">much I should encourage this.</font>

17
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:46,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, Garrett.</font>

18
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:46,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

19
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:52,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">My presentation is
about marriage law.</font>

20
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:57,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is me, Garrett.</font>

21
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in your class.</font>

22
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Stacy.</font>

23
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is in our class as well.</font>

24
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I want.</font>

25
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:10,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Garrett.</font>

26
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy, will you marry me?</font>

27
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:18,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

28
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!</font>

29
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Garrett!</font>

30
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:30,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett and I have been seeing each other
for 16 months, two weeks, and four days.</font>

31
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:33,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">We met at the school
store, Pencils and Such.</font>

32
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was there
for the such.</font>

33
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:38,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember I was sweating a
lot, and breathing heavy, and</font>

34
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">my heart felt like it was
going to burst in my chest.</font>

35
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:43,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the day I met Stacy, most of
those symptoms actually declined.</font>

36
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:46,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you quite done?</font>

37
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:47,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

38
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:48,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett wanted the
proposal recorded.</font>

39
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thought his family
might wanna see proof.</font>

40
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:51,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now what are you shooting?</font>

41
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had a strange
look on your face.</font>

42
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're noticing faces now?</font>

43
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm. Aren't you still smelling
hair to tell Frankie from Annie?</font>

44
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:59,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

45
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:00,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's official.</font>

46
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting laid.</font>

47
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me some more
time in a dream.</font>

48
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:09,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the hope to
run out of steam.</font>

49
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:12,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody said it could be here.</font>

50
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:16,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year.</font>

51
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't count the
reasons I should stay.</font>

52
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:24,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">One by one, they all
just fade away.</font>

53
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

54
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:37,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

55
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, stop.</font>

56
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't put that silly thing away,
I swear, I'm gonna stop loving you.</font>

57
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's it.</font>

58
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:53,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy birthday.</font>

59
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you two doing?</font>

60
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doing Annie's
missing lover footage.</font>

61
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, you know in movies where the
hero's wife or girlfriend is dead or</font>

62
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">missing, and so he sits in the dark
and he watches her in a home movie,</font>

63
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:05,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">or-Or a hologram.</font>

64
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a hologram over and over, and she's
always beautiful and full of love,</font>

65
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:10,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">almost to the point
of being stupid.</font>

66
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:13,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're making footage like that for me
in case I get kidnapped or murdered.</font>

67
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:14,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, super healthy, guys.</font>

68
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The health department called.</font>

69
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't want anything back.</font>

70
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:20,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, don't look
at the camera.</font>

71
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look at the camera.</font>

72
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:23,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today's Garrett's wedding.</font>

73
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">For those who don't know, Garrett,
he's a guy we don't really know,</font>

74
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we've known for like six years
at school, the funny-looking guy.</font>

75
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, mean!</font>

76
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry!</font>

77
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">The eccentric-looking guy.</font>

78
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

79
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's going wrong.</font>

80
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy.</font>

81
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when we said
we were cleaning?</font>

82
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. But remember about
Abed's documentary?</font>

83
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">The documentary is about
what we're doing.</font>

84
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're cleaning.</font>

85
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:52,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but if we're both cleaning
then there's nobody to explain why.</font>

86
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:53,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't understand
filmmaking.</font>

87
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived in New York.</font>

88
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:56,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else should we talk about?</font>

89
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">We volunteered our apartment as a
staging area where our friends can get</font>

90
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">ready and keep each
other on time.</font>

91
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

92
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing to understand
about our friends</font>

93
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:15,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that friends isn't
an adequate label.</font>

94
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:19,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're an intensely,
intimately bonded crew.</font>

95
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can't, no!</font>

96
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:22,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

97
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want flashy forward,
or cherry and classic?</font>

98
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:27,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have black?</font>

99
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a no.</font>

100
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">That beleaguered sigh means,
no, I can't have black nails.</font>

101
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at the camera.</font>

102
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:38,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You absolutely can, and we all
will when our bodies decompose.</font>

103
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't Jim the
camera like that.</font>

104
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim the camera?</font>

105
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">The color black hasn't
had-It's not a color.</font>

106
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything to do with death
or edginess since '89!</font>

107
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:45,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, absence of color.</font>

108
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">My accountant has black nails!</font>

109
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your what?</font>

110
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't jump on that, my accountant,
it's a figure of speech.</font>

111
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a form of speech
called making things up.</font>

112
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:55,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, can you get that?</font>

113
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:57,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can film you getting it.</font>

114
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:58,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's open!</font>

115
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

116
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:03,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, let's see.</font>

117
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:05,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie. Hi girl.</font>

118
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I didn't, put on my wedding
clothes, like you said.</font>

119
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we can get dressed together
and be girls together.</font>

120
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be fun.</font>

121
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie and Britta told me to come
over and get ready with them for</font>

122
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett's wedding.</font>

123
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say no.</font>

124
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who says no to
something like that?</font>

125
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cold, off-putting
incompatible person.</font>

126
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:31,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind of person that turns
a sleepover into a stoning.</font>

127
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:34,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had rocks, thrown at me.</font>

128
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:38,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biblical, igneous, jagged,
hateful, pointy, ninja rocks, and</font>

129
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's not gonna happen again.</font>

130
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you been up to?</font>

131
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:49,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you already asked that.</font>

132
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:49,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you answer?</font>

133
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't I?</font>

134
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I did. I
don't think you did.</font>

135
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:55,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not like me.</font>

136
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you're nervous.</font>

137
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

138
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't we just say that
if you did answer, we forgot so</font>

139
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're asking again.</font>

140
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I have been working.</font>

141
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:13,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been tending
to my personal affairs.</font>

142
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:13,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

143
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mia, I don't know
if I mentioned.</font>

144
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of my sisters as well, you
know, one of them is deceased,</font>

145
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:32,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the other is
mentally retarded.</font>

146
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Panty raid.</font>

147
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I say drink, you say now.</font>

148
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink. Now.</font>

149
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

150
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. When I say
drink, you say now.</font>

151
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:42,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink. Now.</font>

152
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:44,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink. Now.</font>

153
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey what are you guys doing?</font>

154
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:50,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta go. The wedding
starts in like 40 minutes.</font>

155
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:52,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">We batted the time.</font>

156
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? We lied to you cause
we knew you'd be late.</font>

157
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we lied to you
about the time.</font>

158
00:06:57,072 --> 00:07:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! You don't need perfect
people to make a perfect team.</font>

159
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need people whose flaws
feed into each other.</font>

160
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what do you call it?</font>

161
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:07,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Co-dependence.</font>

162
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:08,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Synergy.</font>

163
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">For instance, there might be
something Britta hates doing,</font>

164
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Annie loves doing.</font>

165
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or there might be something
that Annie hates doing, but</font>

166
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:18,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">she does it anyways, because what
she really loves is to feel useful.</font>

167
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">You literally just
defined co-dependence.</font>

168
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's to synergy.</font>

169
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:24,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at you.</font>

170
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little helper.</font>

171
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:25,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Okay,</font>

172
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:31,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you Garrett take Jack Nicholson
to be your lawfully wedded wife?</font>

173
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:33,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

174
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:36,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do, Johnny.</font>

175
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">We invented a new game.</font>

176
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Celebrity Garrett marriage.</font>

177
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:46,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian Slater to be
your lawfully wedded wife.</font>

178
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:49,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

179
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

180
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo.</font>

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only Nicholson.</font>

182
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, listen to him.</font>

183
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:56,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were genius to pad
the time margin.</font>

184
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because now we have, like, three
more hours to play the game.</font>

185
00:07:58,762 --> 00:07:59,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

186
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you, Garrett, take Aubrey
Plaza to be your wife?</font>

187
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

188
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

189
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

190
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean,
three more hours?</font>

191
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that even possible?</font>

192
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what time is the wedding?</font>

193
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what time is it now?</font>

194
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're late.</font>

195
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:21,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're late.</font>

196
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:22,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

197
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:29,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gather everyone to the car.</font>

198
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:29,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Yeah.</font>

199
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:30,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll drive together.</font>

200
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:31,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not driving together.</font>

201
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:31,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's already been settled.</font>

202
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:32,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing was settled.</font>

203
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:38,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

204
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:38,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">They left me home alone.</font>

205
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm home alone.</font>

206
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:43,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not really.</font>

207
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell you doing?</font>

208
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">C'mon, let's go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.</font>

209
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay geez.</font>

210
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you too.</font>

211
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:54,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

212
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:55,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

213
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are here to witness
the union of Garrett and</font>

214
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:08,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy in the eyes of, well in the
eyes of whatever power you choose.</font>

215
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:12,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personally, I find the notion of
choosing to be needlessly limited.</font>

216
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:15,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I'm capable of
total contradiction?</font>

217
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:21,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if science and religion
were mine to wield as I choose?</font>

218
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I'm God?</font>

219
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:26,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I'm God?</font>

220
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is likely that I am not, but</font>

221
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:36,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's totally out of line to
take that possibility off of the table.</font>

222
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I understand that
vows have been written.</font>

223
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:46,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy, when I first saw you,
looking at you made me feel good.</font>

224
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Touching you, felt better and</font>

225
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:53,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">knowing you made me realize that
without you, I, I am incomplete.</font>

226
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I look pretty complete.</font>

227
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:59,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody over there laughed
at that the wrong way.</font>

228
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:02,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my body and my soul.</font>

229
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my favorite video game.</font>

230
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:04,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

231
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:05,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

232
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys guys.</font>

233
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:09,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody's looking at us.</font>

234
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:12,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your was louder
than what I said.</font>

235
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome! Everyone back
there, you're welcome.</font>

236
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please join us.</font>

237
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:25,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of those people
could be God.</font>

238
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:25,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

239
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over there.</font>

240
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Oh.</font>

241
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Ow!</font>

242
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:38,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, since we met you
have felt so familiar.</font>

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love making
sandwiches with you.</font>

244
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love folding towels with you.</font>

245
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:46,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love giving you your pain
killers, at the end of the day.</font>

246
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

247
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well that, those
aren't really vows.</font>

248
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a list of things
you love about me, yeah.</font>

249
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:55,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

250
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:56,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

251
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, do you take Stacy to
be your lawfully wedded wife.</font>

252
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:00,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

253
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:06,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy, do you take Garrett to be
your lawfully wedded husband,</font>

254
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have and to
hold and to honor.</font>

255
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes I do.</font>

256
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
and Mrs.</font>

257
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett Lambert, Garrett
you may kiss Mrs. Garrett.</font>

258
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the party at?</font>

259
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:42,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's endure this.</font>

260
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we mailing today, or what?</font>

261
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would have thought Barrett's</font>

262
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">wedding would be the
best day of our lives.</font>

263
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely not Garrett, since
his name's not Barrett.</font>

264
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:49,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoopsie.</font>

265
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:50,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We say a wrong a name.</font>

266
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:51,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

267
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Racist.</font>

268
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. You a racist.</font>

269
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's a racist.</font>

270
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">From here to there is racist.</font>

271
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

272
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

273
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Having a good time?</font>

274
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes.</font>

275
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Garrett's mom?</font>

276
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sure am.</font>

277
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

278
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you guys could maybe take a
step back, gain a little perspective,</font>

279
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:18,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you don't wreck the whole night
for some really wonderful people.</font>

280
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came to a wedding in the
middle of the vows through a bush.</font>

281
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:27,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Dr. Phil, but, I don't
want my son to kill himself,</font>

282
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, do what you gotta do!</font>

283
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:34,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

284
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

285
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:38,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

286
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:40,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have we done?</font>

287
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we just got checked.</font>

288
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:43,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm. And it was
pretty deserved.</font>

289
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:46,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, we're not just gonna stand
here and lick our wounds either.</font>

290
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:47,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff is right.</font>

291
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that chipper passive
aggressive lady, she's right, too.</font>

292
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:57,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's spread out and-Be the best
wedding guests, anyone has ever seen!</font>

293
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

294
00:12:57,918 --> 00:12:59,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm not gonna over think
it, I'm just gonna try it.</font>

295
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try it. Okay.</font>

296
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

297
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:02,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

298
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:03,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mazel tov.</font>

299
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:07,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, a stranger walked over to our very
proud group and smashed our pride</font>

300
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:12,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">into pieces with a hammer, which
definitely felt like a disaster.</font>

301
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:17,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, I started to pick up the pieces
of our pride, and weirdly enough,</font>

302
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:22,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first piece I picked up
was my own pride, all of it.</font>

303
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:25,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost like groups
and people in groups,</font>

304
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">can never be complete
at the same time.</font>

305
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:29,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that make any sense?</font>

306
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? Well, that's your problem.</font>

307
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:37,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, Abed.</font>

308
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I know how to be a
good wedding guest?</font>

309
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

310
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:42,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little too well,
that's the problem.</font>

311
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:46,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Elroy Patashnik,
and from 2006 to 2009,</font>

312
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was addicted to
encouraging white people.</font>

313
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!</font>

314
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there's a man who
knows his meatballs.</font>

315
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

316
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">It started as simple survival.</font>

317
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tech industry in the
90s, this face, this voice,</font>

318
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're either gonna help
you or hold you back.</font>

319
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you tap the gas, because
well, why tap the brake?</font>

320
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:08,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know, you know
what you're doing.</font>

321
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:11,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man knows exactly
what he's doing.</font>

322
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned the cheat code.</font>

323
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">White people like encouragement.</font>

324
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really doesn't
matter what for.</font>

325
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that's a
container for liquid.</font>

326
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:20,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never felt like a sellout.</font>

327
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:23,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never laugh at anything unfunny,
never said anything untrue.</font>

328
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing is, and this
will sound racist,</font>

329
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:32,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">white people are very discouraged,
and very discouraging to each other.</font>

330
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:35,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, you, you're getting meatball
juice everywhere but your plate.</font>

331
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm going better than
you are, with your asparagus.</font>

332
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:41,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now that's the way
to handle meatballs.</font>

333
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look at you.</font>

334
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Working that asparagus.</font>

335
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the day you start telling them,
hey, just do what you're doing!</font>

336
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:50,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

337
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

338
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel like a superhero.</font>

339
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, what's the danger?</font>

340
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd I stop?</font>

341
00:14:56,856 --> 00:15:01,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, same as anything
else that makes you feel good.</font>

342
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:03,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't put a lid on it.</font>

343
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at these pants.</font>

344
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, oh.</font>

345
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:11,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should keep on wearing,</font>

346
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep on wearing his pants.</font>

347
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no lid.</font>

348
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:21,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy has a 90 year
old meemaw here.</font>

349
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pushed her around
the dance floor.</font>

350
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:25,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she liked it.</font>

351
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's Polly.</font>

352
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:30,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Great Aunt Polly
is Garrett's side.</font>

353
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:30,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't met her.</font>

354
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:34,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my God, do you think she
saw me pushing meemaw, and</font>

355
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">now she's wondering
what's wrong with her?</font>

356
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

357
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, the world will still need
you after you finish your cake.</font>

358
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I that bad?</font>

359
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:43,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have the same dragon.</font>

360
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:49,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually you will slay it, or train
it, or dissolve in its stomach.</font>

361
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Its name is Helping Others.</font>

362
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I train it, can I
give it a cooler name?</font>

363
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you train it, you can
do anything you want.</font>

364
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you slay it, I don't know.</font>

365
00:15:57,086 --> 00:16:00,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you get a new
dragon named Yourself.</font>

366
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you'd be Jeff Winger.</font>

367
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that guy needs help!</font>

368
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:10,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you name your dragon?</font>

369
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:14,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need a
list of dragon names.</font>

370
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! And then we need to
get you away from Jeff.</font>

371
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is what I wanted to say, but
how is that my business?</font>

372
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:27,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't show these to
people when you finish them?</font>

373
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:29,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Okay, good.</font>

374
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then why do you
make them, again?</font>

375
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:36,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">It relaxes me.</font>

376
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like knitting
with less discipline.</font>

377
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:39,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Firebreath.</font>

378
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Pent.</font>

379
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctor Rachel Spinetail.</font>

380
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:43,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holly Hotbreath.</font>

381
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:44,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

382
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:45,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy Talon.</font>

383
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian Scale.</font>

384
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:49,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got into a bit of a
celebrity pun barrel here.</font>

385
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carson Scaley.</font>

386
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:51,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jude Claw.</font>

387
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ariana Puffington.</font>

388
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Are these your
biggest ice cubes?</font>

389
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're boisterous!</font>

390
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my brother!</font>

391
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta thing to say
about my friend Garrett!</font>

392
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:05,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has been a plot twist in the story
of our comeback as wedding guests.</font>

393
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:10,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett's older brother Bones has
relapsed during his weekend pass and</font>

394
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:13,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be unable to do
the best man toast.</font>

395
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:14,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got him?</font>

396
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:17,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I took Garrett's
mom's side and</font>

397
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:21,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">told her after our behavior today, it
was the least I could do for them.</font>

398
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not gonna Winger speech
it, this is a thing of substance.</font>

399
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:28,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">We pooled all the inside info
based on all the mingling, and</font>

400
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">this toast is rocket
fueled selflessness.</font>

401
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:35,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this wedding is gonna regret the
day it thought we'd make it about us.</font>

402
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're about to be the first
guests in history to out-toast</font>

403
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">the entire wedding party.</font>

404
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I love my job!</font>

405
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:44,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, this isn't my job.</font>

406
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I love myself!</font>

407
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was Stacy's first time!</font>

408
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not gonna be her
last time, right Garrett?</font>

409
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many classic toast errors.</font>

410
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fire hydrant
could follow this.</font>

411
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:06,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you so much, and
please, keep painting.</font>

412
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:08,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let Garrett, don't paint.</font>

413
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:11,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let Garrett keep
you from painting.</font>

414
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:12,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm done.</font>

415
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Stacy's friend
Andi everybody.</font>

416
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:17,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next up we have a
replacement best man,</font>

417
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett's friend from Greendale
College, Jeffrey Winger.</font>

418
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:24,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of things I
can say about this couple.</font>

419
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're both in my class
at Greendale, and</font>

420
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:30,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">like all my students, I
give them till about June.</font>

421
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:36,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you guys'll be fine forever, as
long as Stacy never lets Andi babysit.</font>

422
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:40,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or go near a child.</font>

423
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or be in the same town
as a pair of scissors.</font>

424
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">This girl's a wreck.</font>

425
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's being too mean.</font>

426
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's reading the room.</font>

427
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:51,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andi was a bummer,
they needed this.</font>

428
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:54,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life's about two people
merging their lives, but</font>

429
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:59,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">that means two families are
leaving here tonight as one.</font>

430
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a big deal.</font>

431
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:04,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now my friends and I came here
tonight as outsiders, but</font>

432
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">thanks to some good advice,</font>

433
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:12,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">we spent the night learning about
these two clans of outsiders.</font>

434
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:15,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">We learned that Garrett's
uncle Tony is a photographer.</font>

435
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:18,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Uncle Tony, did you know that
Stacy's friend Lawrence makes and</font>

436
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:19,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">sells frames?</font>

437
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:22,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look each other up,
get some business going.</font>

438
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and Garrett's neighbor
Dawn loves vintage cars.</font>

439
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:30,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy's chiropractor Susan
brought her dad, and guess what?</font>

440
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:34,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her dad worked in an
automobile factory in the 60s.</font>

441
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know, these are the kind of
things you learn being the biggest</font>

442
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">jerks at a wedding.</font>

443
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's another golden
nugget in the gravel.</font>

444
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:46,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of you have worked the dance floor
with Garrett's divine great aunt</font>

445
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Polly, 90 years young.</font>

446
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:55,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some of you chatted with Stacy's
meemaw, also 90 years young.</font>

447
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:02,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know if they've
even met before tonight,</font>

448
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:08,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we did learn that both of
them were born in the same town.</font>

449
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:10,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheridan, Wyoming.</font>

450
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:13,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Garrett and Stacy, would you
mind getting them both out here?</font>

451
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:14,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

452
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

453
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Aunt Polly's here.</font>

454
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't she beautiful?</font>

455
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

456
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:25,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who has got eyes on meemaw?</font>

457
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is meemaw.</font>

458
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is meemaw!</font>

459
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I feel like an idiot.</font>

460
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so, so sorry.</font>

461
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:38,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, where's Aunt Polly?</font>

462
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

463
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:47,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, now I don't feel as stupid
because either someone</font>

464
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:52,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">here is lying, or this family's
a lot closer than we thought.</font>

465
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:08,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, this is a man that
knows how to marry his cousin.</font>

466
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:25,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of this would have happened
if I wasn't always trying to help.</font>

467
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, none of this would have
happened if I hadn't tried helping you</font>

468
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your helpfulness.</font>

469
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:30,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't torture
yourself with that logic.</font>

470
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us would have met
if Hitler hadn't been born.</font>

471
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also none of Britta's arguments
would have a default analogy.</font>

472
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

473
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's saying you go to
the Hitler well a lot.</font>

474
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, Hitler, Hitler?</font>

475
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:42,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Britta, we're all the worst
right now, take a day off.</font>

476
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

477
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:48,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between us ruining the ceremony and
ruining the reception when we were all</font>

478
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">just individual people,
I wasn't the worst.</font>

479
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only the worst
with you guys.</font>

480
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:53,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, me too. Me too.</font>

481
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a good dean
before you guys.</font>

482
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:55,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

483
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:56,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't disprove it.</font>

484
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">I relapsed because of you guys.</font>

485
00:21:58,813 --> 00:21:59,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Oh it's not a big deal.</font>

486
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:00,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">White people problems.</font>

487
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

488
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:02,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like this group.</font>

489
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm at my best when
I'm with you guys.</font>

490
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:04,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that clinches it.</font>

491
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:05,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Separate cabs.</font>

492
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Separate cabs.</font>

493
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:08,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Separate cabs.</font>

494
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!</font>

495
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:13,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">For those still with us, we won't
be cutting the cake or dancing.</font>

496
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:16,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I believe there was a guy in a
Homer Simpson costume that was gonna</font>

497
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:16,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">surprise me.</font>

498
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">That won't be necessary!</font>

499
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drive safe, and thank
you for coming.</font>

500
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do?</font>

501
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:25,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang!</font>

502
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:25,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang!</font>

503
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going home.</font>

504
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna stay married?</font>

505
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:28,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang!</font>

506
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:29,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang! Chang!</font>

507
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">We consulted with a lawyer, and</font>

508
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is legal in this state
to marry your cousin.</font>

509
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after talking to our family,
we feel an annulment is warranted.</font>

510
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What no, screw that.</font>

511
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:40,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang. No.</font>

512
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang. No.</font>

513
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:41,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, get back here.</font>

514
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:42,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, screw you guys.</font>

515
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this family
is so screwed up,</font>

516
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">you thought you were two
different families.</font>

517
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that you know you're not,</font>

518
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't wait to leave, and
you want this guy to do what?</font>

519
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:51,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget he's in love?</font>

520
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you?</font>

521
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want him to take one
for this crappy team?</font>

522
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:56,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him finish.</font>

523
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were letting
me finish, sir.</font>

524
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:59,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I was being sarcastic.</font>

525
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know?</font>

526
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:09,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, who loves you
here more than Stacy?</font>

527
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:11,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody.</font>

528
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy, is it your fault
Garrett's your cousin?</font>

529
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

530
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anyone here going to make
less fun of these two or</font>

531
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:21,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">be better friends to them
no matter what they do?</font>

532
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:22,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

533
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:23,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

534
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you against the world,
and you will not win.</font>

535
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:29,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you get to make your moves.</font>

536
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:30,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not them.</font>

537
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:44,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stacy, will you be my
legally incestuous wife?</font>

538
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

539
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone stay and eat
cake, or go to hell.</font>

540
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about me.</font>

541
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:04,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think I could
do it, but I did.</font>

542
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:04,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile.</font>

543
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile.</font>

544
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:07,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, look up.</font>

545
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!</font>

546
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

547
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much Jenny.</font>

548
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, what an episode
of Community.</font>

549
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:31,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Briggs Haddon credited
author of this weeks episode.</font>

550
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might have noticed an
emphasis on the topic of incest,</font>

551
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">well that's no accident.</font>

552
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:38,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the past two years, when not
serving as writer's assistant on</font>

553
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Community, I've been researching
incest on the internet.</font>

554
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I found, surprised me.</font>

555
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that first cousins can
have children without great risk of</font>

556
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">birth defect or genetic disease?</font>

557
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:51,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a quote directly from the
New York Times, April 4, 2002.</font>

558
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">But despite this
scientific fact,</font>

559
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:56,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">state laws on incest remain
inconsistent and woefully outdated.</font>

560
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean I, I can make love to
my cousin in Nebraska, but if</font>

561
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:03,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take her on a date in South Dakota,
I'm looking at 15 years prison time.</font>

562
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:06,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told the Community writers,
attention must be paid.</font>

563
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said they'd allow me to
address it on one condition.</font>

564
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:13,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the end of the episode, I must
appear and identify myself as a writer.</font>

565
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:15,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm not trying to tell
you how to feel about incest,</font>

566
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:19,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just letting you know, there's
more to it than you've been told.</font>

567
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:25,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Briggs Haddon, and I wrote the
Community season six, incest episode.</font>

568
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

569
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:02,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get any of that?</font>
