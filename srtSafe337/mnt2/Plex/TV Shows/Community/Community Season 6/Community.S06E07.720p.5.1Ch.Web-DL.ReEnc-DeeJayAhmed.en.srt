00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next item is Friday's alumni dance.</font>

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that progressing.</font>

3
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:09,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've emailed every former
student who's not in prison</font>

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">or jail, everyone remember
there's a difference.</font>

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our alumni are touchy about that.</font>

6
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:14,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the difference?</font>

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go to jail if a cop doesn't like you.</font>

8
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:19,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't send you to prison
without knowing you're poor.</font>

9
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:21,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe half our own politics?</font>

10
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:22,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

11
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm still trying to find a good DJ.</font>

12
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:28,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">By which I mean figure out
what makes a DJ good, or bad,</font>

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">or different from a phone or laptop.</font>

14
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, how's it going with the
PowerPoint for the city council meeting?</font>

15
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:34,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good question.</font>

16
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:51,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you asked if I knew
PowerPoint, I said, yes.</font>

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:51,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I really mean?</font>

18
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:56,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are yeses and nos in the chart.</font>

19
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">They appear to be the same.</font>

20
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:01,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, I</font>

21
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:06,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">think you'll find.</font>

22
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:13,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">That within some</font>

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:19,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">eggs is the truth.</font>

24
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:24,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should have been a dollar bill.</font>

25
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm no magician.</font>

26
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a guy that knows PowerPoint.</font>

27
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, pushing that meeting.</font>

28
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:37,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">In other news, campuses across
the country including this area</font>

29
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:40,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">have been seeing a dramatic
rise in guerilla marketing.</font>

30
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did they need
marketing, they're amazing.</font>

31
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:42,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's guerrilla with a u.</font>

32
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:43,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

33
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking about undercover
advertisers that blend in with the public</font>

34
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:48,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">while covertly marketing certain products.</font>

35
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:51,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can advertise things
without you knowing?</font>

36
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that legal?</font>

37
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:53,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds like brain Windexing.</font>

38
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is legal.</font>

39
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mostly harmless, but I
would like to protect some of our</font>

40
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">more impressionable students
from being unduly influenced.</font>

41
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you see anything let the Dean know.</font>

42
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, don't freak out.</font>

43
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone just told me that Honda
has released some kinda super</font>

44
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:10,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">vehicle called the Honda Fit.</font>

45
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:14,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a small car with a big
personality that can handle anything,</font>

46
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:15,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">life throws at you.</font>

47
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I standing here talking about it?</font>

48
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:19,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to find a Honda
dealer, school is cancelled.</font>

49
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:20,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Honda Fit is happening.</font>

50
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's finally happening.</font>

51
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just going to give this school's
assets a quick freezy wheezy. it.</font>

52
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this meeting over?</font>

53
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:30,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so, but sometimes we
just hang out and say funny stuff.</font>

54
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun with that.</font>

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

56
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:41,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, do you feel like Elroy doesn't
like us as much as we like him and</font>

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">each other?</font>

58
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably doesn't know his role yet.</font>

59
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:48,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, is he black Pierce, old Troy,
or Shirley without a giant purse?</font>

60
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:50,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't exactly been a whirlwind
of entertainment since Troy left.</font>

61
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true.</font>

62
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:53,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just me, you
guys have been boring too.</font>

63
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I just gotta ask.</font>

64
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was so special about this Troy person?</font>

65
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he own a rainbow?</font>

66
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he the group's pharmacist?</font>

67
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't like to talk about it.</font>

68
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you often do.</font>

69
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:07,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a problem solver give me information.</font>

70
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:07,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll handle this.</font>

71
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:12,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy was very gifted at steel drums.</font>

72
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steel drums.</font>

73
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting.</font>

74
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this has been a great meeting.</font>

75
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm off.</font>

76
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:23,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">That won't pay off immediately,
but it's gonna pay off.</font>

77
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that Jeff, is the truth.</font>

78
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:33,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you lose the egg you
put the dollar bill in?</font>

79
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how it works?</font>

80
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

81
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that guy you were in love
with, but your love was torn asunder</font>

82
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:11,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he was a human incarnation
of certain sandwich franchise?</font>

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sub. Don't say it.</font>

84
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ever say that name
without compensation.</font>

85
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how much that experience hurt you,</font>

86
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:21,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I'm warning you that
I just saw him in the parking lot.</font>

87
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:22,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

88
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Breathe, the self destructive part
of you wants to run straight to him,</font>

89
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you need to be
smarter than that, right?</font>

90
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:28,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

91
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:29,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you Annie.</font>

92
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:36,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I have one more class, but if you
can wait 40 minutes I will meet you.</font>

93
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nuh-uh.</font>

94
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:39,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">See I just don't fling
myself into the wild.</font>

95
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:43,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hub of a quality camping experience
is a safe and reliable generator.</font>

96
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:48,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'll talk
to you girls later, right.</font>

97
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay inventive and enthusiastic.</font>

98
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

99
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:52,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

100
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sub. No, no, no, no,
that's my sandwich name.</font>

101
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm my own man now.</font>

102
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a free, reliable,
quality man, named Rick.</font>

103
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Rick.</font>

104
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:04,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. That's for half of my heart.</font>

105
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's for the other half.</font>

106
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:09,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is for being the reason
there's two halves of my heart.</font>

107
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you actually crouch down a
little bit cuz you're taller than my</font>

108
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">instructor and I'm only a yellow belt.</font>

109
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Britta it took me this
long to gain my freedom.</font>

110
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never stopped thinking about you.</font>

111
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you touched me in ways no one ever has.</font>

112
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

113
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came back for you.</font>

114
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did?</font>

115
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Rick.</font>

116
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:28,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what I got.</font>

117
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Great Dean.</font>

118
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

119
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">But where's your Honda Fit?</font>

120
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I drive a CR-V.</font>

121
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:37,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fit combines the efficiency of
a sub-compact with the versatility to</font>

122
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:39,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">take whatever life throws at you.</font>

123
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! That's what you said!</font>

124
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:40,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's me!</font>

125
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can the CR-V not take
what life throws at it?</font>

126
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:46,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but the CR-V has
durability and storage.</font>

127
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:48,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that makes sense.</font>

128
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet my bank has a grace period.</font>

129
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to get a CR-V!</font>

130
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:58,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guerrilla marketing for Honda?</font>

131
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:59,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

132
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:00,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not allowed to know that.</font>

133
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:02,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm useless to Honda, if anyone knows.</font>

134
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:03,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

135
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same story all over again.</font>

136
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:06,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I disagree.</font>

137
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I think it's a whole new story.</font>

138
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a beard now and an identity.</font>

139
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selling Hondas is just my job.</font>

140
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:14,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they make great products
that I'd wanna sell, anyway.</font>

141
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">So can you have a girlfriend?</font>

142
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I thought.</font>

143
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, see you around as a friend.</font>

144
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:22,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">As friend, Britta,</font>

145
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">can I at least show you the CR-V's
easy fold-down 60-40 split row seat?</font>

146
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:30,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 15 minutes.</font>

147
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:31,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, friends for real.</font>

148
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great news.</font>

149
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The steel drum thing paid off?</font>

150
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">We invited Elroy to meet us in
the study room for a game night.</font>

151
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:42,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, yes.</font>

152
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Are you gonna play pretty

156
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">The classic game of whose ears
you have, which ears have it, and</font>

157
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">whether you have those ears.</font>

158
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're work-shopping new hand shakes.</font>

159
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys realize it's just
reinforcing his aloofness.</font>

160
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want someone to like
you, you don't get to know them.</font>

161
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sit back and wait for
them to notice you're cool.</font>

162
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:10,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you? 13?</font>

163
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:12,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the age allowance
on The Ears Have It?</font>

164
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven and up. Then I'm six.</font>

165
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say, you've become
more reliable and durable.</font>

166
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm, I hope we could do this again.</font>

167
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Rick, I want a normal relationship.</font>

168
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:30,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to experience brunch in public.</font>

169

reason to text my parents.</font>

171
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can have a relationship, we just
have to follow a few simple rules.</font>

172
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rick?</font>

173
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you in there?</font>

174
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to hide.</font>

175
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:43,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">The windows are fogged over.</font>

176
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you napping heavily?</font>

177
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hide forever.</font>

178
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but you can hide in comfort.</font>

179

183
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ta-da.</font>

184
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why choose, when you can Hond-oose.</font>

185
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and that blower that
was just an impulse buy.</font>

186
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, Dean, you know, one
vehicle's enough for one person.</font>

187
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I know that in
my head, but I can't shake</font>

188
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">this fear of losing even one small
part of what Honda has to offer.</font>

189
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, you're level seven susceptible.</font>

190
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

191
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:19,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

192
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:23,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing, I

193
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:23,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on board.</font>

194
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:26,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

195
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:28,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are.</font>

196
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,349

197
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and San Diego, and The Bronx.</font>

198
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman?</font>

199

<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I large?</font>

200
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I Elvis?</font>

201
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:51,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking dolphin, but I knew
they didn't have ears because my dentist</font>

00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:54,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">has a poster of one on the ceiling,
and I recently had a root canal.</font>

you all the way down the hall.</font>

00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you can have my spot.</font>

208
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:03,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should, I should leave.</font>

209
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

210
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, well, fun hanging
out with you Elroy.</font>

211
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you have your choice of friends
and we thank you for choosing us.</font>

212
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:12,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy choice to make.</font>

213
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, told ya.</font>

214
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy doesn't like us,
what are we gonna do?</font>

215
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are goofs.</font>

216
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:22,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we were silly.</font>

217
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got up to make nachos and
Elroy said, that was not-cho job.</font>

218
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we laughed.</font>

219
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he made them for me.</font>

220
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:28,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was more than word play.</font>

221
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really wasn't my job in his eyes.</font>

222
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't seen that side of him until now.</font>

223
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a great time.</font>

224
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Till Jeff showed up.</font>

225
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Maybe he just doesn't like Jeff.</font>

226
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:39,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, my deal.</font>

227
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:39,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boston rules.</font>

228
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,143

229
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elf ears are wild, joker
ears are regular ears.</font>

231
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:45,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rat ears are an automatic loss.</font>

232
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sneaking, sniffing, or grunting,
and no asking do I have lobes.</font>

233
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shane's ahead by three pair.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">With an asterisk.</font>

235

236
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:53,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it is. I cheat my
ass off at everything.</font>

237
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cheating at a game of
hide and seek right now.</font>

238
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't supposed to
leave the rec center.</font>

239
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's do this.</font>

240
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extra cards.</font>

241
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid sink!</font>

242
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time!</font>

243
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother.</font>

244
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:07,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate.</font>

245
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

246
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">No rush.</font>

247
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. What do you need?</font>

248
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">A club soda please.</font>

249
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a little something
in there to keep it company?</font>

250
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:18,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you recommend?</font>

251
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, scotch and soda's is a classic.</font>

252
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's okay.</font>

253
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just got this one in.</font>

254
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got a pig on the bottle.</font>

255
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:27,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this one, this one's really good.</font>

256
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:28,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aged eight years.</font>

257
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoky.</font>

258
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:31,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">From Scotland.</font>

259
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little pricier but worth it.</font>

260
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:36,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drink this one when I've
got a reason to celebrate.</font>

261
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I will take that one.</font>

262
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:39,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've got something to celebrate.</font>

263
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:40,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, what's that?</font>

264
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:41,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's good.</font>

265
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

266
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:49,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, this is my boss.</font>

267
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">From Honda?</font>

268
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:53,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">In public you'll refer to
us as Hilary from now on.</font>

269
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:53,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Continue.</font>

270
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:57,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a program we can be in,
where we covertly market as a team,</font>

271
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:00,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can be a couple in a
relationship in public.</font>

272
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can walk down the street holding hands.</font>

273
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I take a job tricking people
into buying things they don't want.</font>

274
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:09,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you enjoy billboards
and commercials, Miss Perry?</font>

275
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean shill-boards
and con-mercials?</font>

276
00:11:13,378 --> 00:11:14,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

277
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I detest them.</font>

278
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:19,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are unmanned bulldozers rolling
over everything in their path.</font>

279
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Rick does is surgical.</font>

280
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:25,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">He finds that part of each
life that Honda can improve and</font>

281
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:29,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">gently bathes it in the most
helpful information possible.</font>

282
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:32,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think, you
understand how surgery works.</font>

283
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came in here to get a club soda.</font>

284
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:37,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, I am drinking probably,
the best Scotch I've had in years.</font>

285
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:37,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you trick me?</font>

286
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I suffering?</font>

287
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:43,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you love this man?</font>

288
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. Then I pronounce you
a highly influential couple.</font>

289
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:50,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may kiss your boyfriend.</font>

290
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:56,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, where'd he go?</font>

291
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, that's not for us to understand.</font>

292
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay, but he's right there.</font>

293
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Todd.</font>

294
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys.</font>

295
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if we sit with you?</font>

296
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, that would be great.</font>

297
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:20,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to say, you guys
seem very happy together.</font>

298
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, we have our moments.</font>

299
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm excited because we're
going antiquing this weekend.</font>

300
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love antiquing.</font>

301
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is so old.</font>

302
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:27,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it too.</font>

303
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:28,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you hated it.</font>

304
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:32,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated finding these treasures and
not being able fit them in the car.</font>

305
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:34,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I got a CR-V.</font>

306
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:35,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">CR-V? Yeah, Rick's new Honda.</font>

307
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't shut up about it.</font>

308
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's kind of a game changer.</font>

309
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly a sex life changer!</font>

310
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, for being obnoxious!</font>

311
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what you've been up to?</font>

312
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember.</font>

313
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:50,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">CR-V you say?</font>

314
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:51,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">CR-V.</font>

315
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">CR-V.</font>

316
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:56,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're amazing.</font>

317
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're amazing.</font>

318
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honda's amazing.</font>

319
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to meet my parents.</font>

320
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:00,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

321
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:02,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honda.</font>

322
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Britta's in love.</font>

323
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:05,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

324
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be a very special young man.</font>

325
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet they'll be together
for a very long time.</font>

326
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:17,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man you got him pegged, man, pegged.</font>

327
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:19,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Jeff.</font>

328
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey, here you can have my seat.</font>

329
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:22,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just going to class.</font>

330
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait before you go, I
know you have every one of</font>

331
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie's Freezing CDs, but Abed
found some songs by them online</font>

332
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they did for a charity
album for homeless skateboarders.</font>

333
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:38,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plastic doll parts, wall
paper chrysalis, weird blanket.</font>

334
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never heard these.</font>

335
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is great, thanks.</font>

336
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

337
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:43,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay away from that mechanic.</font>

338
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless I need wrench made of licorice.</font>

339
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:53,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, I'm, I'm sorry.</font>

340
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I'm like a fart to that guy.</font>

341
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't get away fast enough.</font>

342
00:13:56,584 --> 00:14:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No, I mean, maybe.</font>

343
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell happened at that ears
game that made him like you so much?</font>

344
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few brief moments of human vulnerability.</font>

345
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:06,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really your wheelhouse.</font>

346
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:10,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sure you have detailed
files on human vulnerability, Abed.</font>

347
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:12,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Whoa, take a knee, man.</font>

348
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:12,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right, Jeff.</font>

349
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want Elroy to like you, maybe
you need to put yourself out there.</font>

350
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean bribe him?</font>

351
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">With gifts?</font>

352
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like your Natasha Freezes CD?</font>

353
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie's Freezing.</font>

354
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:23,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

355
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie's Freezing.</font>

356
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:26,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha.</font>

357
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:27,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie is freezing.</font>

358
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

359
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:29,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie is freezing.</font>

360
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie is freezing. Natalie is freezing.</font>

361
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:38,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

362
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:42,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, I.</font>

363
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

364
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:45,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honda.</font>

365
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:46,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">The power of dreams.</font>

366
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:50,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Pelton, I know how
susceptible you are to advertising.</font>

367
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you say, I'm a
level seven susceptible.</font>

368
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because why would I?</font>

369
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:56,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's moon man talk.</font>

370
00:14:56,107 --> 00:15:00,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mentioned a new kid earlier,
who told you about the new Honda Fit.</font>

371
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rick.</font>

372
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:02,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's boyfriend?</font>

373
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but he's not.</font>

374
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:04,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

375
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a good man.</font>

376
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he wouldn't secretly be working
for Honda, because when we first met</font>

377
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was secretly working for
completely different company.</font>

378
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you I don't know how to.</font>

379
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a rule about being constructive, so</font>

380
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't ask any questions right now.</font>

381
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:25,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because all of the questions I
have right now are rhetorical and</font>

382
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">they end with the word idiot.</font>

383
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what a rhetorical, no of
course you don't know what that is,</font>

384
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:29,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're an idiot.</font>

385
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I am so sorry.</font>

386
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:35,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're so stupid.</font>

387
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea.</font>

388
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:40,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're the only one who
has no idea, because guess why?</font>

389
00:15:40,118 --> 00:15:42,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't answer that, you'll get it wrong.</font>

390
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">So dumb.</font>

391
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just a dumb little man
who tries to destroy this school</font>

392
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:47,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">every minute.</font>

393
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sorry.</font>

394
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

395
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh it's okay.</font>

396
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:01,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean it's not okay, but shh, shh, shh.</font>

397
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so stupid.</font>

398
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:04,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh shh, shh, shh.</font>

399
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:07,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a dummy.</font>

400
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are just so thrilled
that you brought a friend.</font>

401
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:11,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thrilled.</font>

402
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, and it is friend then?</font>

403
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:14,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean is that the correct moniker?</font>

404
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boyfriend.</font>

405
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

406
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:21,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is, well that's,
whoa, this is very exciting.</font>

407
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy you could just bowl me over
with one of those sweet heart,</font>

408
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know what are the, you
remember at the Johnson's cabin, we.</font>

409
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:28,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feathers.</font>

410
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could blow me over with a feather.</font>

411
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have a lovely home.</font>

412
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love this carpet.</font>

413
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:35,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. It reminds me of the quality
floor mats in my Honda CR-V.</font>

414
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on sweetie that's not necessary.</font>

415
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You refer to your floor mats as quality,</font>

416
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never heard that level
of floor mat enthusiasm.</font>

417
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we be caring more
about our floor mats, George?</font>

418
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we should
jump to conclusions, Deb.</font>

419
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let the man finish his story.</font>

420
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:50,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're floor mats.</font>

421
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:51,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the story.</font>

422
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:52,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's this?</font>

423
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:53,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that? Look all around.</font>

424
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:55,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's things all around us.</font>

425
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:56,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to see a movie?</font>

426
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:57,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have one. What is it, George?</font>

427
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's it's the The Aviator.</font>

428
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it, The Avatar.</font>

429
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:08,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">No thank you, that movie
is three hours of puke.</font>

430
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Britta's joking.</font>

431
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">We enjoy Avatar very much.</font>

432
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do?</font>

433
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it's an immensely popular movie.</font>

434
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, we love it.</font>

435
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many alumni have responded?</font>

436
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:27,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not many.</font>

437
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:30,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think our current students
will show up for the degree raffle.</font>

438
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about we put the DJ over there?</font>

439
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna need a DJ.</font>

440
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been saying that since the
invention of the shuffle button.</font>

441
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:38,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have booked a surprise
musical guest this evening.</font>

442
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:43,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little piece of 90s nostalgia
you might call Natalie is Freezing.</font>

443
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your damn mind.</font>

444
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You know this band?</font>

445
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:52,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know damn well I do.</font>

446
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you always wha, what, what,
are you trying to get me to like you?</font>

447
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Good, cuz it aint' working.</font>

448
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weird, hair gelled, CPR dummy.</font>

449
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:03,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pomade.</font>

450
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:09,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as I'm up here, does
anyone want anything reached?</font>

451
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:11,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we're Natalie is Freezing.</font>

452
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you Natalie?</font>

453
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Julie. The name of the
band is Natalie is Freezing.</font>

454
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone in the band be Natalie?</font>

455
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:18,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're artists.</font>

456
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

457
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:21,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, our DJ was going to man
the frozen yogurt machine.</font>

458
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:22,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that something you guys can handle?</font>

459
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:25,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do need anything
reached, I've been practicing.</font>

460
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We like Avatar?</font>

461
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">In public, yes.</font>

462
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">We like things most people like.</font>

463
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our job isn't to alienate people.</font>

464
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the job with my parents?</font>

465
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">With everyone, everywhere, all the time.</font>

466
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted a relationship.</font>

467
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:43,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real one.</font>

468
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:44,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real.</font>

469
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you not think, Honda
makes good products?</font>

470
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:47,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, I do.</font>

471
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's never been remotely in question.</font>

472
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, why does that mean that I like Avatar?</font>

473
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:53,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're not a monster.</font>

474
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, cuz people don't want
to drive what a monster drives.</font>

475
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the Honda, Rick.</font>

476
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?</font>

477
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:04,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use a light press of your foot
engage the highly responsive</font>

478
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:08,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">anti lock brakes of this
incredible vehicle, now.</font>

479
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be with you, the real you.</font>

480
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:12,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is me.</font>

481
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I do.</font>

482
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:21,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I influence people to buy Honda
products, I feel God's pleasure.</font>

483
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's from Chariots of Fire.</font>

484
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love Chariots of Fire.</font>

485
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:24,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do I.</font>

486
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also we have to.</font>

487
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:32,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dammit Britta.</font>

488
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:33,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops.</font>

489
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh man.</font>

490
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:41,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You people are everywhere.</font>

491
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was looking for a place to hide.</font>

492
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, I'm not gonna bother you.</font>

493
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:49,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay then, give me a gin and tonic.</font>

494
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend Jeff booked Natalie
is Freezing for the dance.</font>

495
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

496
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:58,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight we gotta go.</font>

497
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you excited?</font>

498
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:03,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to date her.</font>

499
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really.</font>

500
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name is Julie.</font>

501
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would the bands name be her name?</font>

502
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's an artist.</font>

503
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:09,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've listened to them together.</font>

504
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:11,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never said anything about this.</font>

505
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:16,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">She messed me up, she
messed me up pretty good.</font>

506
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:18,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's to forgetting.</font>

507
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:19,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not gonna toast to that.</font>

508
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:21,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then forget you too.</font>

509
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a break.</font>

510
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole problem.</font>

511
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:26,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody's in such a rush to
protect themselves from each other.</font>

512
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:31,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. Yes, you gotta defend
your castle, but you also gotta.</font>

513
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:33,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that thing that castles have?</font>

514
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walls.</font>

515
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:35,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. A moat.</font>

516
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:37,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes over the moat, goes over the moat.</font>

517
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enemy knights, cavalry arrows?</font>

518
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:40,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, come on. Stop it.</font>

519
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes like this.</font>

520
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:43,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alligators?</font>

521
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's one thing.</font>

522
00:20:44,397 --> 00:20:45,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mechanical.</font>

523
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">One mechanical alligator?</font>

524
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you screwing with me?</font>

525
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know what the
hell you're talking about.</font>

526
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one mechanical thing.</font>

527
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes over the mote.</font>

528
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:52,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes like this.</font>

529
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">A catapult!</font>

530
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Oh, Jesus!</font>

531
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:55,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what are you doing?</font>

532
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

533
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

534
00:20:58,268 --> 00:20:59,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna quit Honda.</font>

535
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:02,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get a job I, I, I don't know.</font>

536
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:03,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do regular people do?</font>

537
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well they buy things.</font>

538
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:06,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do that.</font>

539
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me?</font>

540
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:08,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, for Honda.</font>

541
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:08,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, for you.</font>

542
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Normally I would give you a hard time,
but I don't wanna be like this guy.</font>

543
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:15,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait you're coming.</font>

544
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:16,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming to you. You're coming over?</font>

545
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:17,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

546
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:18,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

547
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay that seems like really the hard way.</font>

548
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay wait watch out for the split there.</font>

549
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:22,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

550
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:23,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on.</font>

551
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on to me!</font>

552
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god.</font>

553
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow what do we do now?</font>

554
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:32,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">My school's having a dance tonight.</font>

555
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">My favorite band is playing.</font>

556
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

557
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!</font>

558
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drawbridge, a drawbridge.</font>

559
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need a drawbridge.</font>

560
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:04,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Elroy's favorite band too.</font>

561
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once, I once hallucinated one
of their music videos in his RV.</font>

562
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:08,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird.</font>

563
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the Dean can't
introduce the band tonight.</font>

564
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in his office deciding
what kind of vehicles to buy for</font>

565
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">the athletic department.</font>

566
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he needs a whole fleet.</font>

567
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:18,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right a fleet of vehicles.</font>

568
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:20,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just needs to pick a model of car.</font>

569
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:20,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in his office.</font>

570
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear that? Yes, I heard
it, Rick, but we're out of the game.</font>

571
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

572
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can leave on a high.</font>

573
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:28,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dean is a level
seven susceptible, Britta.</font>

574
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a one-in-a-lifetime
feeling, you won't believe it.</font>

575
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:32,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do believe it, but I don't need it.</font>

576
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

577
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:36,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just do this one last
job, then we'll be free.</font>

578
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:41,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.</font>

579
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I'm a level seven susceptible too.</font>

580
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they assume somebody
is named Natalie in the band?</font>

581
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">It, it like happens all the time.</font>

582
00:23:09,393 --> 00:23:10,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, remember we were in Syracuse?</font>

583
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy?</font>

584
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Julie, you messed me up.</font>

585
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came after me because
I wasn't interested.</font>

586
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got me interested, and I fell hard.</font>

587
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you got bored and destroyed me.</font>

588
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:29,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been afraid to love anybody
for 20 years since, but not anymore.</font>

589
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I still love you, but I'm
not gonna keep on hurting others,</font>

590
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:32,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">just because you hurt me.</font>

591
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:34,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

592
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:35,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

593
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:40,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's you. That's my impression
of you, you jaded hipster a-hole.</font>

594
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still love your music.</font>

595
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:43,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a great gig.</font>

596
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:47,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy, I'm tired of playing this game.</font>

597
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:52,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you and I want you to like me.</font>

598
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:53,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

599
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good guy, Jeff Winger.</font>

600
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are gonna be friends.</font>

601
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great, whatever.</font>

602
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

603
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:00,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

604
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:03,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

605
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:03,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

606
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:04,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

607
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:05,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

608
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:06,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

609
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

610
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:19,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Britta.</font>

611
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:23,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, did you know your boyfriend
was guerrilla marketing for Honda?</font>

612
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew he represented
something I wanted to buy.</font>

613
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did good, Frankie.</font>

614
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't I do good?</font>

615
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:33,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, good Dean.</font>

616
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:34,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart Dean.</font>

617
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

618
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be fine.</font>

619
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he can never come back here.</font>

620
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:40,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

621
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:49,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course if, you want to come with us.</font>

622
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:52,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you are good.</font>

623
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:54,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had nothing to do with it.</font>

624
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:57,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 2015 Honda CR-V sells itself.</font>

625
00:24:57,816 --> 00:25:03,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why it's this years Motor
Trend Sport Utility of the Year.</font>

626
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my, where did he go?</font>

627
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

628
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:24,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

629
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know all of you know this next one.</font>

630
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garbage woo hoo!</font>

631
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:37,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moonlight, bleeding
glass and healing needles,</font>

632
00:25:37,356 --> 00:25:40,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">amputated hearts are never whole.</font>

633
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:42,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this song is about me.</font>

634
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too bright.</font>

635
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:44,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or heroin.</font>

636
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares? Dreaming as the
screaming seagulls feed on parts</font>

637
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">of me I keep below, oh, oh, Orion.</font>

638
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:57,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your belt and let
me go where you've been.</font>

639
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:04,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm flying overhead the
buffalo are falling dead inside.</font>

640
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:10,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eternity it was you and me, how
sweet it'd be, my wandering star.</font>

641
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now I ask a question.</font>

642
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom does, we answer it.</font>

643
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:35,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I?</font>

644
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rabbit. Obviously you can't do that,</font>

645
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:39,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">obviously you can't ask what you are.</font>

646
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:40,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, change your ears. Okay, sweetie.</font>

647
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:43,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you didn't say that before.</font>

648
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, ask Mom a question about your ears.</font>

649
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't see my ears.</font>

650
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you're asking.</font>

651
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Deb, what are my ears?</font>

652
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:49,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

653
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, am I an animal?</font>

654
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes.</font>

655
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are, and so are you.</font>

656
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, whatever happened to Rick?</font>

657
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:56,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my God.</font>

658
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

659
00:26:58,357 --> 00:26:59,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ships in the night I guess.</font>

660
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you ask that?</font>

661
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:03,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came over here, because
Rick and I broke up.</font>

662
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that. I just thought
maybe something had changed.</font>

663
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:07,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">While I was sitting here?</font>

664
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well you know these days with all the apps.</font>

665
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Play the game.</font>

666
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:13,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, which friend
of ours collects me?</font>

667
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joann Schunbucker.</font>

668
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:16,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm elephant.</font>

669
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:17,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

670
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">How in the hell did you</font>

671
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:18,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I an animal?</font>

672
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:21,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not by a long shot.</font>

673
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:24,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I work in your office?</font>

674
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:24,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom.</font>

675
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan, in accounts receivable,
not his first wife but second wife,</font>

676
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:28,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one that made cake for Memorial Day.</font>

677
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I Mr Spock.</font>

678
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:33,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes you are, I love this game.</font>

679
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:35,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. This is fun.</font>

680
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

681
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:42,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we did something wrong.</font>

682
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we did, Deb.</font>
