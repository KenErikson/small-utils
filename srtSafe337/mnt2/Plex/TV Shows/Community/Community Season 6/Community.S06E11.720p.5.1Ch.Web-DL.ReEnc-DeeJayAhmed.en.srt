to the sun soaked Tampa coast.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been to every place where
you can find a human race but</font>

00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been Vicki the mooooooost!</font>

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get a shovel,
because theater is dead.</font>

5
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:20,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

6
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:30,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi Starburns.</font>

7
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:35,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Todd, you know you don't have to
creep around to be weird, right?</font>

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're weird at picnics.</font>

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear about the paintball game?</font>

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I heard there was no paintball.</font>

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard it was banned.</font>

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you can't believe
everything you hear.</font>

13
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you just asked if
I heard something and</font>

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">now you're invalidating the whole.</font>

15
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:52,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Aah!</font>

16
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why I beat you, Todd?</font>

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, you don't?</font>

18
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:42,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cuz I don't either, but that was insane.</font>

19
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:43,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm 50, here.</font>

20
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:45,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, I think I could win this year.</font>

21
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I can go all the way.</font>

22
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:50,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you'll be settling for silver.</font>

23
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Names, you give me names or
you're expelled, that simple.</font>

24
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:33,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told ya, I don't know nothing
about no secret paintball games.</font>

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is from huffing paint, I swear.</font>

26

27

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your horse panties.</font>

29
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:41,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell me you knew my name.</font>

30
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:45,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I was about to take Todd
out, and then we both got shot.</font>

31
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy was invisible.</font>

32
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ghost.</font>

33
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uses silver paint.</font>

34
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ghost?</font>

35
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:52,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">So no name?</font>

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd call him Silver Ghost, but</font>

37
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:57,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's probably already taken by an
indie comic book or a terrible tequila.</font>

38
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye forever Starburns.</font>

39
00:02:58,917 --> 00:02:59,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

40
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no, no.</font>

41
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:01,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't make me. Frankie?</font>

42
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:04,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I respect that you are
my boss, so either fire me or</font>

43
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">let me handle this and go to your office.</font>

44
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:11,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to give your paintball
friends a message, Jeff.</font>

45
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.</font>

46
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">This era is over.</font>

47
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was fun while it lasted,
but now mommy's home.</font>

48
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody with a gun will
be expelled or fired.</font>

49
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:20,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, Miss Dart.</font>

50
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:22,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boys and I will get this
cleaned up in no time.</font>

51
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:23,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

52
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, do you know Deputy Custodian Lapari.</font>

53
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:29,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we haven't had the pleasure because Mr.
Winger has caused me nothing</font>

54
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">but pain over the years
with his paint balling.</font>

55
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I quit that.</font>

56
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:33,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's behind me.</font>

57
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:33,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure it is.</font>

58
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Handling turds has rubbed off on him.</font>

59
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:41,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Custodian Lapari is gonna be
honored this week at the Gala for</font>

60
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:42,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Cleaner Greendale.</font>

61
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:43,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like you to introduce him.</font>

62
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I do that?</font>

63
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're the de facto
leader of Greendale.</font>

64
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you gave a speech coming out
against paintball, it might end it.</font>

65
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:50,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

66
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:53,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because I'm not playing doesn't
mean I'm the weenie that tells</font>

67
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:53,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">people not to.</font>

68
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please?</font>

69
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not for Greendale, then for me?</font>

70
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll think about it.</font>

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I was a different guy back then.</font>

72
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Two, never mind.</font>

73
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Frankie's upset.</font>

74
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she break up with someone?</font>

75
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:12,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which gender?</font>

76
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care, but everybody else does.</font>

77
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's upset about paintball.</font>

78
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:16,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paint?</font>

79
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:18,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ball?</font>

80
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:22,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Occasionally our campus erupts into
a flawless, post modern, homage to</font>

81
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">action adventure mythology,
mischaracterized by the ignorant as parody.</font>

82
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:29,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, now that Frankie's declared
it illegal, it's gone underground,</font>

83
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">and is still happening as we speak.</font>

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well maybe for freshman, but</font>

85
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">honestly we've kind of
done it to death, right?</font>

86
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done it?</font>

87
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nailed it? I've won a few time now.</font>

88
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, who keeps track of that?</font>

89
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lame! I'm thinking mostly about Frankie.</font>

90
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's our friend, and she cares about
this school, and I think it would</font>

91
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">break her heart if she caught any
of us undermining her goals.</font>

92
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:49,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

93
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:50,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree. A reasonable agreement.</font>

94
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're both right.</font>

95
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, meeting adjourned, I guess. Hm-hm.</font>

96
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:53,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is good.</font>

97
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad we all agree not to do this.</font>

98
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is gonna make it a lot
easier for me to beat you.</font>

99
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

100
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">They killed meeeeeee!</font>

101
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

102
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do anything stupid.</font>

103
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do something stupid.</font>

104
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we weren't playing.</font>

105
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:11,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this an alliance?</font>

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, is it?</font>

107
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's people? Cut the crap, Elroy.</font>

108
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that, what are you doing?</font>

109
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Go back to class.</font>

110
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger's playing paintball.</font>

111
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's not.</font>

112
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think about it, don't think about it.</font>

113
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:22,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do it.</font>

114
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:37,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grow up.</font>

115
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

116
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not playing.</font>

117
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a guy who's not playing, you sure
are shooting a bunch of mothers.</font>

118
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was instinct.</font>

119
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:44,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't help being a bad ass.</font>

120
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I am not playing.</font>

121
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:48,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so let's make this painless.</font>

122
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy. Leave her alone.</font>

123
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:49,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

124
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock it off.</font>

125
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie is coming.</font>

126
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:53,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is important to you people?</font>

127
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:01,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger shot me.</font>

128
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I use echo location to navigate?</font>

129
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you ask that after
learning you aren't a bat?</font>

130
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:06,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

131
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Frankie.</font>

132
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie.</font>

133
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:13,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Jeff, student just passed by me
and said you shot him with paint.</font>

134
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

135
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you are definitely
not playing paint ball?</font>

136
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

137
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, I've been cool up until
now, but I gotta tell you,</font>

138
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:25,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to get offended
by your suspicion about this.</font>

139
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well. Well is a hole in the
ground when you're thirsty.</font>

140
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I'm telling you, I ain't
playing no paintball.</font>

141
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:32,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo hee haw, boo hew haw, bam.</font>

142
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, take it easy guys.</font>

143
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for what it's worth, thank
you for teaching me the cool,</font>

144
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:42,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">new way to respond to people
saying the word well.</font>

145
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:43,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right guys.</font>

146
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye Franks take it easy.</font>

147
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you stop doing that?</font>

148
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't hate the player.</font>

149
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colloquialisms aside, Annie's right.</font>

150
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing to hate this year is the game.</font>

151
00:06:57,194 --> 00:07:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I show you all something?</font>

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know this game is being run
anonymously through an online server, but</font>

153
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:03,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">who set it up?</font>

154
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">They haven't left a clue which is a
really big clue because if they're this</font>

155
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">good at anything.</font>

156
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:07,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they here?</font>

157
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:11,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever's running this server is offering
a huge cash prize to the winner.</font>

158
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">More evidence they don't go here.</font>

159
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they seem to have their
own man in the game.</font>

160
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've probably heard about a mysterious
player using silver paint balls.</font>

161
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at these IP addresses.</font>

162
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:24,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that means what I think it means,
we're dealing with gibberish.</font>

163
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are mine.</font>

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a student or</font>

165
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:29,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">teacher on this campus opening an
encrypted tunnel to an off campus site.</font>

166
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:30,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big deal.</font>

167
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do that all the time.</font>

168
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:32,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I save it all up for Saturday night.</font>

169
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, it's no big deal.</font>

170
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:36,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you always do it immediately
before a paintball player is taken out</font>

171
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">with premium grade silver
paintballs by an unknown shooter.</font>

172
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:44,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">And unless the IP that you're
connecting to is this one.</font>

173
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah, of course.</font>

174
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's the Silver paintballs guy?</font>

175
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spy, assassin, mercenary, bad
person walking among us laughing,</font>

176
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">laughing quietly.</font>

177
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then if we look pretending that
he was looking at something funny.</font>

178
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:58,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose you all should be in trouble.</font>

179
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:03,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">But desperate deans hm, but</font>

180
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">desperates, but des, but</font>

181
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:14,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">desperate deans call for
Deansperate measures.</font>

182
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">From here on out, you work for me.</font>

183
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything you're saying
just proves my point,</font>

184
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the only way to lose
this game is to play it.</font>

185
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:27,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I say we do the honest
thing, and tell Frankie.</font>

186
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">The school's playing and losing
already, Frankie included.</font>

187
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the people in this room play to win,</font>

188
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can not only take City College's money.</font>

189
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:36,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can expose Silverballs, and, in turn,
City College, and save Greendale.</font>

190
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:38,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is basically saving Frankie.</font>

191
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:41,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, so we lay low, and we try
to find out who Silverballs is.</font>

192
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:44,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're not, to be clear,
we did not vote on that name.</font>

193
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a name you don't have to vote on.</font>

194
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:50,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just became the Secret
Dean Force, The Dean Boys,</font>

195
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Task Force Dean, His Dean, Secret People.</font>

196
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the word Dean is in it.</font>

197
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when the politicians fail,
and the peace talks fall apart.</font>

198
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it seems like all is lost, and</font>

199
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:05,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">nobody really needs the Dean
anymore because Frankie's here.</font>

200
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when you go in.</font>

201
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:11,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last bastion of a bygone
era when people respected me.</font>

202
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:23,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Force One.</font>

203
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're gonna hang around,
we could use some water.</font>

204
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:27,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">On it.</font>

205
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:33,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Club Club, the last club
I thought I'd ever join.</font>

206
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your target is a small time
paintball munitions dealer.</font>

207
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:40,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we know is he's a white male over
30 and his street name is Fun Dad.</font>

208
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:44,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right is everybody in this
club ready to party the way they</font>

209
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">do in clubs?</font>

210
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connor stop horsing around
with Billy and party.</font>

211
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">DJ might be the guy from MeowMeowBeenz.</font>

212
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need clean intelligence, Abed.</font>

213
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:55,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">No references, call backs.</font>

214
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me good sir, if
I could have the mic.</font>

215
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:03,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention shoppers there's a sale
on partying in my pants aisle.</font>

216
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything in my pants must go.</font>

217
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:09,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well not everything, that
doesn't, you know what I.</font>

218
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:09,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Koogler?</font>

219
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aladdin. I thought your name was Fun Dad.</font>

220
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:14,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

221
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:15,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was easy.</font>

222
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:16,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need ammunition.</font>

223
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a narc? Why would
I answer that honestly?</font>

224
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:19,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good point.</font>

225
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's how most people answer, so.</font>

226
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:22,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, come on, it's a bad question.</font>

227
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just get so many narcs.</font>

228
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:24,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey don't forget.</font>

229
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:27,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a sign up sheet on the
back wall for Club Club Club.</font>

230
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm so glad Omar that
you're interested in paintball.</font>

231
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I have to tell you,
no shooting in here.</font>

232
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:35,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first rule of Club Club is
that we are not a fight club.</font>

233
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:40,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second rule is that if you're a hot
lady, you have to have sex with me.</font>

234
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:41,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then there's a bunch of rules and</font>

235
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">restriction that they've just now been
adding because of the lawsuits based</font>

236
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">on that, second rule, which, I'm
not allowed to call a rule.</font>

237
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my screw up.</font>

238
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you what I've got here.</font>

239
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:53,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, these are blue travelers.</font>

240
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:57,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've got some sarcastic
mellow yellows in here.</font>

241
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:58,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are great.</font>

242
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these are green meanies.</font>

243
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:03,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">They explode on contact, and they
mark your target with paint.</font>

244
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a description of every paint ball.</font>

245
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so you know your stuff.</font>

246
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't I give you a pro discount?</font>

247
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:11,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking something more
exotic, something in silver?</font>

248
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay, great.</font>

249
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:18,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's a great idea, you know?</font>

250
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:25,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to stay in the game?</font>

251
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:26,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk.</font>

252
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look.</font>

253
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're a narc, you can't play.</font>

254
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:36,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you're playing, I
do accept sex for ammo.</font>

255
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or beer, right?</font>

256
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:38,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not Bitcoin.</font>

257
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:39,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I believe in it.</font>

258
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:43,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just, I think I feel like
I need it to stabilize.</font>

259
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is Silver Man?</font>

260
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">My accountant?</font>

261
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how do you know David?</font>

262
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:48,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean.</font>

263
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who buys the silver ammo?</font>

264
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, if I tell you
that, I'm pretendsies dead.</font>

265
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Koogler? We got him.</font>

266
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

267
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he wont be needing this.</font>

268
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:17,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Koogler's thumb drive is actually
a hardware encryption key.</font>

269
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, can it be unencrypted?</font>

270
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you use it to decrypt
something encrypted.</font>

271
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:23,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">A key with a lock on it.</font>

272
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give our enemy this.</font>

273
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're clever.</font>

274
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did they pair us together?</font>

275
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:32,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, a message chain between
Koogler and Silverballs.</font>

276
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's ordering a huge batch of ammo, and</font>

277
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">stressing that he needs it before
the Cleaner Greendale Gala.</font>

278
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">City College is-Whoa!</font>

279
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! City College is going
to crash Frankie's Gala.</font>

280
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:47,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here's where Silverballs
decides on silver balls.</font>

281
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:51,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which color will look coolest
against a navy blue jumpsuit?</font>

282
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wears a jumpsuit to a black tie gala?</font>

283
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:56,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guest of honor.</font>

284
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your Internet not working?</font>

285
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:00,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one photo.</font>

286
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:01,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's taking an hour.</font>

287
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:06,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have keystrokes programmed
to, eesh, that's dorky.</font>

288
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like we'll be renting formal wear.</font>

289
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll measure Jeffrey.</font>

290
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mister Winger, you clean up nice.</font>

291
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on. I'm always good looking.</font>

292
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">This seems ambitious.</font>

293
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:27,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the monorail is more symbolic of
our potential than it is potential,</font>

294
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">and none of our buildings will
ever be shaped like this.</font>

295
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with a little work,
this is how we could feel.</font>

296
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be proud.</font>

297
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jeff, for supporting this.</font>

298
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:40,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that in your ear?</font>

299
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,923

00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's check in.</font>

302
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:52,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should stereotypes have
their awareness raised, I?</font>

303
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good lord.</font>

304
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:54,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm questioning you again.</font>

keeping your mind on the mission?</font>

312
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your eyes on the prize.</font>

currently examining a spoon,</font>

320
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:26,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm using it was cover while watching
a somewhat suspicious waiter.</font>

324
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negative voice of Diedrich Bader.</font>

325
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Continue to check the custodial wing,</font>

326
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,994

of the inside of your office.</font>

327
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:38,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

328
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for the record, I feel
very vulnerable without a gun.</font>

329
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:47,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, I know that someone
plays in this thing.</font>

00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there, Dean.</font>

I was ordering dinner.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Should I come in now?</font>

351
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no you can't ever come
in ever, you're sloppy.</font>

352
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me can I have a word with you?</font>

353
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">About what?</font>

354
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:03,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's been some reports
about a paintball game on campus.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Agh!</font>

00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:59,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stand before you one of Greendale's
biggest perpetrators of paint related</font>

00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:04,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">mayhem and I am happy to say that those
days are fully behind our school.</font>

369
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:08,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking back on those dark days,
it's clear that the only heroes were</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the janitors and the custodians
left to clean up our messes.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

372
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:17,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

373
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ow!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">So it is with great shame and
poetic irony that I present</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the custodial innovation award
to Vice Custodian, Lapari.</font>

00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, focus.</font>

381
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, man?</font>

382
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. It wasn't our guy.</font>

383
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">The assassin is not in the kitchen.</font>

384
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:50,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still at large.</font>

385
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:56,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now let's all enact what I hope
will become a yearly tradition,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the popping of the balloons.</font>

387
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

388
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:07,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Stay calm, check your zones.</font>

389
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:12,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that?</font>

390
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:12,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

391
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:13,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

392
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see anything.</font>

393
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:15,809

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

395
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:42,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

396
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the custodians.</font>

397
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:59,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale's custodial staff is running
the underground paintball tournament</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">probably with City College money.</font>

399
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people that clean Greendale
don't want a cleaner Greendale,</font>

400
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:08,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">they want Greendale to be afraid
of itself and reliant on them.</font>

401
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what an exciting story.</font>

402
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:15,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're got a real life M
Night Shamalyan here.</font>

don't anticipate yours holding up.</font>

00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:24,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's heckling me?</font>

407
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, of course, it's the Indian guy.</font>

408
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Arabic.</font>

409
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, okay, let's go with that.</font>

410
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, you know what goes
great with crazy stories?</font>

411
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evidence. You're the evidence.</font>

412
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back to our side and tell the
truth, so City College can be exposed.</font>

413
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I could leave and get
a job at City College,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">where their pay phones aren't only
herpe-free, they're actually removed.</font>

take you if you lose their</font>

420
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

421
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I agree.</font>

422
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:16,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie look</font>

423
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">out.</font>

424
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:23,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

425
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:28,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">An eye for an eye.</font>

426
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

427
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

428
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

429
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:42,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

430
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:47,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

431
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:52,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

433
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:59,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the last ones left?</font>

434
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:00,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cover me.</font>

00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:02,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dreams do come true!</font>

436
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:09,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we got him.</font>

437
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went into a supply closet.</font>

438
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:11,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

439
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess to a custodian, a supply
closet is like a location.</font>

440
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm actually relieved. I thought
this was gonna be a whole gauntlet.</font>

441
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:24,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">My heart was not in it.</font>

442
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:26,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I shot a disabled kid.</font>

443
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:27,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this anymore.</font>

444
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at?</font>

445
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a closet.</font>

446
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's really nice of you guys to visit,</font>

447
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">not that you ever would
have done it intentionally.</font>

448
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your steamy pipes can't stop us.</font>

449
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:57,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it would be a pretty bad
museum exhibit if it could.</font>

450
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up, Lapari.</font>

451
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Dean, I have a microphone.</font>

452
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:02,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a beer.</font>

00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:09,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an old stand up line
for using up hecklers.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep moving.</font>

457
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you do stand up?</font>

458
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you became a custodian?</font>

459
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:18,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen man, I was there in the 90s.</font>

460
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:21,284

461
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:23,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw what karaoke did.</font>

462
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't cool man.</font>

463
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:29,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not so different, you and I, Dean.</font>

464
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:32,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see we're both
in the same situation?</font>

465
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you gotta be kidding me.</font>

466
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw it. Shoot them all.</font>

467
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them is him.</font>

468
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:41,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot every single one.</font>

469
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:50,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not back here.</font>

470
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,054

happen when you let Frankie Dart</font>

the school before she notices</font>

479
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:17,624

all get to be our own heroes.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What a backfire!</font>

483
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the money real?</font>

00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:29,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">No mater who wins?</font>

485
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:31,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, what are you doing?</font>

486
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you thinking about?</font>

487
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, I don't know.</font>

488

492
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're tobacco.</font>

493
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we are not tobacco.</font>

494
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are Robert Downey Jr,</font>

495

into people's windows.</font>

rather be heroes than villains than</font>

to work a lot at getting less sucky.</font>

499
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will forgive us.</font>

500
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:05,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know her, I like her, and if she
fires either of you, I'll quit.</font>

501
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:08,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not the enemy, she can help us.</font>

502
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:09,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just have to cool it.</font>

503
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true, what he said.</font>

504

<font color="#FFFFFF">If you guys lower your guns, I'm
not gonna throw you a party, but</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you Monday, idiots.</font>

507
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who wins?</font>

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we-. Okay,</font>

509
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:42,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the count of three we're gonna
shoot ourselves in the foot.</font>

510
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:54,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two.</font>

511
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:54,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

512
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you guys on Monday.</font>

513
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:14,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Pope looks at the giraffe
and says I'm in the room.</font>

514
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:16,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I can't remember the whole joke.</font>

515
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:19,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay it sounds very
funny based on the last line.</font>

516
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie's gonna be here
soon we should get ready.</font>

517
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:23,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not seriously still
doing this are we?</font>

518
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:27,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">We promised everyday for a
week do we want her to quit?</font>

519
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:31,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning everyone.</font>

520
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:32,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wah.</font>

521
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:37,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, where did we leave off last time?</font>

522
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:37,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. Yes, sir.</font>

523
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like big trucks.</font>

524
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:42,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a fire truck today.</font>

525
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:43,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting point.</font>

526
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would anyone care to comment?</font>

527
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:45,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy?</font>

528
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a stinky.</font>

529
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worth considering.</font>

530
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:48,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next item?</font>

531
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you pronounce pasketti?</font>

532
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:50,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spaghetti.</font>

533
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else?</font>

534
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:52,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we go to the zoo?</font>

535
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that raises a very important point.</font>

536
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:59,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can do anything we want if, and
this is very important, if we grow up.</font>

537
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">All in favor?</font>

538
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:00,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wah.</font>

539
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then she starts singing about
all the places she's been.</font>

540
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, by the way, seems
to be a total of two.</font>

541
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:11,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of which is old DC.</font>

542
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old DC.</font>

543
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:18,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay fine, Vicki, you're a music
major, not a history major.</font>

544
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:21,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the whole mother thing, I mean the
two big feathers in her cap are that</font>

545
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">she hasn't let anything change her, a
triumph she shared with most animals,</font>

546
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:29,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all dirt, and the fact
that her mother died,</font>

547
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is like one thing all mother's do.</font>

548
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:34,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, was she a good mother?</font>

549
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she collect stamps?</font>

550
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:36,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she race cars?</font>

551
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know!</font>

552
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:41,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know her name, I think if you
ask Vicki the color of her mother's</font>

553
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:42,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">eyes, she would say dead.</font>

554
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:46,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, maybe she would say $7 a seat.</font>

555
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad man, I am telling you.</font>

556
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody is safe, nobody is safe.</font>

557
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blue.</font>

558
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:03,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were a very pale shade of blue.</font>

559
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:08,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry my show didn't
honor her memory properly.</font>

560
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try to make it up to you.</font>

561
00:27:13,012 --> 00:27:18,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually we both will a, a, at
the premier of our new show.</font>

562
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:24,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki and Garrett.</font>

563
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:26,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a hand for
Vicki's mother everybody.</font>

564
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand up Connie.</font>

565
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:29,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki's mother, Vicki's mother!</font>

566
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:30,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo!</font>

567
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd rather you boo.</font>

568
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means you felt something.</font>

569
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

570
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can boo.</font>

571
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Andy Kaufman loved booing.</font>

572
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

573
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then again, we did put a fair
share of work into this.</font>

574
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, you don't have to be dicks.</font>

575
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get any of that?</font>
