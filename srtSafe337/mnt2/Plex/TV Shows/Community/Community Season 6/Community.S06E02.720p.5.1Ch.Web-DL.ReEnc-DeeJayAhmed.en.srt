00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">and planting it in
the printer garden.</font>

150
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so funny?</font>

151
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, besides
everything?</font>

152
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no intention of
returning this system.</font>

153
00:07:56,312 --> 00:08:01,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the contrary,
I intend to keep it.</font>

154
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God.</font>

155
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:05,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delete!</font>

156
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,855
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>One file selected.</i></font>

157
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hold on.</font>

158
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:15,891
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>File sorted.</i></font>

159
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Oh, come on.</font>

160
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Come here
you little.</font>

161
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,397
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>File deleted.</i></font>

162
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus wept!</font>

163
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">He deleted the serial number,
Jeff, help me out here.</font>

164
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get paid
enough for this.</font>

165
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do you think
you're going to get paid</font>

166
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I have to find five
grand in the budget?</font>

167
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the new Annie.</font>

168
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the new Abed.</font>

169
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
that means yet.</font>

170
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">So are the gremlins supposed to be
the good guys in this version?</font>

171
00:08:58,703 --> 00:08:59,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blue ones are.</font>

172
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">The green ones are bad and the red
ones are kind of like isolationists.</font>

173
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a metaphor for World War II.
- Ooh.</font>

174
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:07,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I will be right back,
I left something in my car.</font>

175
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

176
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, yes, I picked up a sofa
from your store, recently.</font>

177
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last name is Perry.</font>

178
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

179
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

180
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you strong or angry?
- My parents?</font>

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents bought
that couch?</font>

182
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:34,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explain yourselves!</font>

183
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, are we, okay.</font>

184
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">They kind of reached
out to us on Facebook.</font>

185
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You know I don't
talk to them.</font>

186
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:46,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah. That's why
they talk to us.</font>

187
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">They knew you wouldn't let them
help you, at least not directly.</font>

188
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god. Oh my god.</font>

189
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:54,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">You needed our help, but we
needed their help to help you.</font>

190
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:55,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we were able to get you
such a good deal on the rent.</font>

191
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're supplementing
my rent too? - Mm-hm.</font>

192
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:02,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make them sound like monsters,
but they're actually really nice.</font>

193
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they are!</font>

194
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents are
horrible people.</font>

195
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're being dramatic.
- Oh yeah.</font>

196
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what people say
when they take your soul,</font>

197
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:24,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they rip it out of your chest
and then shove it in your mouth.</font>

198
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got bit by a cat.</font>

199
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:39,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will create more worlds.</font>

200
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:42,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">And those worlds
will have worlds.</font>

201
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're file folders,
stop calling them worlds.</font>

202
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:47,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found an address.</font>

203
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:51,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy Patashnik, founder of
Virtu Good technologies.</font>

204
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:54,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'll go see if I can
get the school's money back.</font>

205
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep White Morpheus
inside the Matrix.</font>

206
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff.
- Britta. You look distraught.</font>

207
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:04,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have ten seconds to tell me
it's not about stupid politics.</font>

208
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just found out that Annie and Abed have
been cheating on me with my parents.</font>

209
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been sabotaging
my life from the shadows</font>

210
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:12,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">by paying off my debts
and buying me things.</font>

211
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:14,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank God.
- What are you?</font>

212
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank God?
- The charade can finally end.</font>

213
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you know everything
you thought you owed us,</font>

214
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can actually just
owe to Deb and George.</font>

215
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:21,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deb and George?</font>

216
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know my parents too?</font>

217
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when?</font>

218
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, since
thousands of dollars ago?</font>

219
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:31,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bad with dates. I remember the New
Year's glasses having zeros for eyes.</font>

220
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when did Stella
get her groove back?</font>

221
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've all been lying
to me for years.</font>

222
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What kind of friends are you?
- Poor.</font>

223
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're poor friends.</font>

224
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:42,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you mooch off us because you're too
proud to use your own support system.</font>

225
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of
friend are you?</font>

226
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">And having met them, what
were you rebelling against?</font>

227
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it generosity,
whimsical game nights,</font>

228
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">or delicious lobster
bacon mashed potatoes?</font>

229
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ate the potatoes?</font>

230
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You-You don't even eat carbs.
- I eat love, Britta.</font>

231
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:00,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot, delicious love that you were
willing to wipe your ass with.</font>

232
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

233
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no friends.</font>

234
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we not be so
dramatic about this?</font>

235
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people in this
world with serious problems.</font>

236
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, go see the nurse!</font>

237
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying.</font>

238
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:30,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Elroy Patashnik?</font>

239
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's asking?
- Well, that's always a yes.</font>

240
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody ever says, who's asking,
to the wrong name.</font>

241
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just say,
that's not my name.</font>

242
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my phone rings and I say hello,
and they say, is Pablo there?</font>

243
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't say, who's asking,
I say, wrong number.</font>

244
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:43,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a clever young man.</font>

245
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:45,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm 40.
- Come in.</font>

246
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

247
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sold a Virtu Good
6500 to Craig Pelton</font>

248
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:56,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">at Greendale Community College,
and we need to return it.</font>

249
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need
the serial number.</font>

250
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:01,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">He deleted the serial number
because he loves the system.</font>

251
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the problem?</font>

252
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:04,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is in
order to copy a file,</font>

253
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:05,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to throw
a fireball at it,</font>

254
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">then absorb the fire, then drop
the flaming file into a crystal lake,</font>

255
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">then take out both copies and throw
them into the side of a mountain.</font>

256
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worlds within worlds.</font>

257
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:15,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't
mean anything.</font>

258
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can copy a file by holding
my finger down on a phone.</font>

259
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, so can a monkey.</font>

260
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:21,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you're describing
a system for animals.</font>

261
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrestrial slobs bound
to the earth by their meaty feet.</font>

262
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:27,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I designed
a system for gods.</font>

263
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

264
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you've done.</font>

265
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how lame
virtual reality is.</font>

266
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the damage it
caused mid-90s cinema.</font>

267
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Michael Douglas walking
around like a jackass,</font>

268
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">moving files with
a magic glove?</font>

269
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lawnmower Man?
Did you see Lawnmower Man?</font>

270
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bet your sweet ass
I saw Lawnmower Man.</font>

271
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:45,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I consulted on it.</font>

272
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took Brigitte Nielsen
to the premiere.</font>

273
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were building
worlds within worlds.</font>

274
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you're living in homes
within campers within parking lots,</font>

275
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">and using an iPad to clearly design what
looks like a ripoff of Angry Birds.</font>

276
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

277
00:13:58,495 --> 00:13:59,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my Winnebago!</font>

278
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:02,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not allowed to say
that like it's a punishment.</font>

279
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:05,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what it's like
to lie for a living, Elroy!</font>

280
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you should know, it
feels better to stop.</font>

281
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my feet aren't meaty!</font>

282
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, honey.
- An unexpected treat.</font>

283
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a check for all the dirty
money you have used to control</font>

284
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">and monitor me
without my consent.</font>

285
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But we're not gonna cash this.
- Well you can't.</font>

286
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I postdated it a year.</font>

287
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in that year, I'm
gonna get a new job,</font>

288
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">new friends, in a new city where you
and your spies can never find me.</font>

289
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.
Don't do this.</font>

290
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:47,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice do
you leave me?</font>

291
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:51,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who acts this dishonestly
towards their own daughter?</font>

292
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice do
you leave us?</font>

293
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, every time we get
too close, you run off.</font>

294
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sent you a birthday card
to your apartment in New York,</font>

295
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then next week you're setting
fire to a Jamba Juice in San Jose.</font>

296
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:04,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long is that
gonna stick with me?</font>

297
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:07,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until arson is legal, sweetie,
but your father's point is,</font>

298
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've arrived at the closest
relationship you can tolerate.</font>

299
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hm.
- We've learned, after a decade,</font>

300
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to love and admire
and finance you from afar,</font>

301
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">through your friends,
and the social media.</font>

302
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tinder and the like.</font>

303
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:25,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's called Tumblr, dad.
- No, I mean Tinder.</font>

304
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:29,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a matchmaking app, and by
the way, if you were on Tinder—</font>

305
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom and I think
you'd be the prettiest.</font>

306
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, the boys
would be swiping right.</font>

307
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or girls!</font>

308
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Whatever makes you happy.</font>

309
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

310
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What has happened
to you two?</font>

311
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:45,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these doddering
open-minded geezers?</font>

312
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:48,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the people who wouldn't let
me dress up like Prince for Halloween?</font>

313
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:52,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or told me that the cat ran
away because I tried alcohol?</font>

314
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:56,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or had me drug
tested when I was 11</font>

315
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:59,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they said I was
laughing too much?</font>

316
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:03,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are definitely sorry
about all of that stuff.</font>

317
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:06,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite frankly, we don't
remember that stuff.</font>

318
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's true.</font>

319
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Woodstock, oh!
- Oh, my god.</font>

320
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember Woodstock!</font>

321
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:17,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woodstock was amazing but-but
you have to realize, Britta,</font>

322
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:22,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your Woodstock, which
was us being bad parents,</font>

323
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">that has more
to do with you.</font>

324
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's what you
remember, see?</font>

325
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

326
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?</font>

327
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hm.
- I'm sorry.</font>

328
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:34,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out here!</font>

329
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, let me explain.</font>

330
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:40,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were worried
about you, so</font>

331
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:45,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">- we just came over.
- You can explain to each other in hell.</font>

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends don't visit
each other's parents.</font>

333
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:53,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you have
a wonderful life.</font>

334
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:01,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

335
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:04,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">George, George, yes.</font>

336
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, at least take some
money and fix your car!</font>

337
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:10,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or at least get a cab, or there are apps
we can call where strangers pick you up.</font>

338
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want your help.</font>

339
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop infantilizing me!</font>

340
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, stop. Stop!</font>

341
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:19,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get out of here.
- Hey!</font>

342
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green Machine, nice.</font>

343
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Greg, here,
take some cash.</font>

344
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap!</font>

345
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's her problem?</font>

346
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's growing up.</font>

347
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god.</font>

348
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put a tilde on this n!</font>

349
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:51,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do anything.</font>

350
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any luck?</font>

351
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh,</font>

352
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going home.</font>

353
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:03,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and to warn you, he joked
about wanting a pee jar earlier</font>

354
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's gradually
becoming less of a joke.</font>

355
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dean.</font>

356
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming over and I'm
pulling you out of there.</font>

357
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll bite you.
- I'll beat you up.</font>

358
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:15,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll like it and then I'll fire you
and then I'll get right back in it.</font>

359
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll still get to beat you up.
- Hold it. Hold it.</font>

360
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

361
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:22,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recognize that
baritone voice</font>

362
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the scent of Tic Tacs
with a tinge of Naugahyde.</font>

363
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:27,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Elroy Patashnik.</font>

364
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">The architect.</font>

365
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I've come to tell you something
very important about this system.</font>

366
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's lame.</font>

367
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

368
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:42,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasted your time with it and 10
crucial years of America's time.</font>

369
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm giving Mr. Winger your refund.
- I don't want a refund.</font>

370
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna stay in
here forever</font>

371
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:51,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you can't stop me.</font>

372
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die.</font>

373
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has he
been in there?</font>

374
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four hours.</font>

375
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh,</font>

376
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking weeks.</font>

377
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:05,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha. Yep!</font>

378
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy runs your school?</font>

379
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">To use a phrase
I coined in the 90s,</font>

380
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:18,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going in.</font>

381
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You coined that?
- Oh yeah, lock and load.</font>

382
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's mine too.</font>

383
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

384
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm awake.
- Aah!</font>

385
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh my God!
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.</font>

386
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
doing in my car?</font>

387
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have
anywhere else to go.</font>

388
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">No where else but my car?</font>

389
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how big
the planet is?</font>

390
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:53,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on, Britta?</font>

391
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:57,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends, they all think
my parents are adorable,</font>

392
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they think that I'm
the bad guy for hating them,</font>

393
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have a right to hate them, cuz
I had to be there when they sucked.</font>

394
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:03,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

395
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy Fallon syndrome.
I get it.</font>

396
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had that with
my parents, too.</font>

397
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You did?
- Yeah.</font>

398
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:14,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, one of the most unfair
lessons we're forced to learn</font>

399
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that our parents
are human beings.</font>

400
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:20,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanna think of them
as gods or demons,</font>

401
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">because then that
would make us heroes.</font>

402
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">But give me a break.</font>

403
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all suck.</font>

404
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do to help
you tonight, Britta?</font>

405
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:34,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many quarters were
in this cup holder?</font>

406
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same amount.</font>

407
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:39,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

408
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,122
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Calibrated. Welcome.</i></font>

409
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:43,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, go away!</font>

410
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,606
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Preferences grow.</i></font>

411
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
No, no, no.</font>

412
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:53,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go of me.</font>

413
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really want
the power of a god?</font>

414
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, more than anything.</font>

415
00:20:58,153 --> 00:21:01,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I order dinner, cuz a lot of
good delivery places are closing?</font>

416
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how you feel.</font>

417
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:06,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sadder reality,
the less real we want it.</font>

418
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna be
a good dean.</font>

419
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:11,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can give you a device
that will accomplish that.</font>

420
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

421
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can use this
to manipulate worlds.</font>

422
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Flick of a wrist.
- Ha!</font>

423
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:25,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">My god, it's incredible!</font>

424
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

425
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening. No!
Ow. I wanna go back in.</font>

426
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be
back in there.</font>

427
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:37,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to be—
- Here. Here. Here's your power.</font>

428
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:38,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

429
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:41,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, manipulate worlds.</font>

430
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

431
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:47,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be back to his
old self in an hour.</font>

432
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:50,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, do you have
a way to fix that?</font>

433
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seriously, though, thank you.
- Mm hm.</font>

434
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, we were
so worried.</font>

435
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened to the kid's
Green Machine? - What?</font>

436
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I, I don't know. I ditched it.
- Where and how long ago?</font>

437
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, assume that's not
what's important here.</font>

438
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, we—
- It's okay, Dad.</font>

439
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something
that I wanna say.</font>

440
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:23,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ran away from home at 17
to become an adult,</font>

441
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:27,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">but maybe all that did was leave
a part of me stuck at 17,</font>

442
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:31,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">the part that tends to run away when
I am confronted with the truth.</font>

443
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:33,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The truth is good, Britta.
- Mom, shut up!</font>

444
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie taught me
something important.</font>

445
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:39,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter how mature we
are or what resentments we carry.</font>

446
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:43,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that matters is that
we're all going to die.</font>

447
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:50,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.</font>

448
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we're really getting
our daughter back?</font>

449
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's not gonna
be that big of a deal.</font>

450
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you guys
missed the good years.</font>

451
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, it's just gonna be
margaritas, Pottery Barn,</font>

452
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:02,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting our family's tendency toward
obesity as we slide into oblivion.</font>

453
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:04,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">First you guys, and then
me quickly thereafter.</font>

454
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll drink to that.</font>

455
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed.</font>

456
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Benjamin.</font>

457
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:15,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got bit by a cat, Deb.</font>

458
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

459
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:20,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the antibiotics.</font>

460
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:24,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for
the refund, Elroy.</font>

461
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you</font>

462
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:30,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">for one last taste of what it was
like when my work was valuable.</font>

463
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's still valuable.</font>

464
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:37,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, $500 for the taste
I got of being powerful.</font>

465
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean, the school can't afford 500—
- Wait for it.</font>

466
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:49,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea what to do
with the rest of my life now.</font>

467
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">We offer a wide
variety of classes.</font>

468
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:59,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that, my friend, is
the Greendale effect.</font>

469
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never get out
of here, will I?</font>

470
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't met
many that do.</font>

471
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:09,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's walk arm in arm.</font>

472
00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:14,238
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There are times when change
needs to be different,</i></font>

473
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:17,638
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>then there's changes
that are more the same.</i></font>

474
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,468
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But the same changes don't
tend to be different</i></font>

475
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,671
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>than the changes
that came before.</i></font>

476
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,527
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If you change everything
that's different,</i></font>

477
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:29,678
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>sometimes you find out
everything's still the same.</i></font>

478
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:34,322
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As for me, I'm
just changing</i></font>

479
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:37,672
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>everything
that's different.</i></font>
