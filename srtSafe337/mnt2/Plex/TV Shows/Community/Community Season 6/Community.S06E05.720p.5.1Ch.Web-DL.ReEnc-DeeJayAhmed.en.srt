1
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:04,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did Frankie call us here?</font>

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:08,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Some financial prospect
that could put the school in the black.</font>

3
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:12,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which always confuses me,
because black means bad.</font>

4
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:13,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it's a cat or banana</font>

5
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:18,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a shirt that makes you think
you've lost more weight than you have.</font>

6
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:21,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice save. Sorry about that, man.</font>

7
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm? What?</font>

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:26,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone use the word black and now
you want me to give you the all-clear?</font>

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please tell me that won't
be my role in this group.</font>

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a brain the size of Jupiter.
I'm nobody's fourth Ghostbuster.</font>

11
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I promise, this group
does not think that way.</font>

12
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:38,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, before you got here, they had two.</font>

13
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:39,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

14
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:43,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had to often step back</font>

15
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:45,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and remind themselves that they
weren't one collective ray of light.</font>

16
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a cult? Are you gonna eat me?</font>

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're fine, I lived in New York.</font>

18
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:54,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of which, mid-terms are over</font>

19
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was thinking we could
have a party at our apartment.</font>

20
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:58,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed? Annie?</font>

21
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have a party.
You can't have a rager.</font>

22
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:03,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a rule against
more than eight guests.</font>

23
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:07,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight guests? That's not, not
a rager. That's not a party.</font>

24
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:08,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice grammar.</font>

25
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:12,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you have a rule against parties,
which I'm sure is a world record</font>

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">for uptightness, so let's celebrate that.</font>

27
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring the booze and
more than eight guests.</font>

28
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:20,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you just moved in. You
don't even have a real bedroom.</font>

29
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:23,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a coucher.</font>

30
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sleeps on the couch. She's a coucher.</font>

31
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:30,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So I get nothing?
- You get a couch. You get a home.</font>

32
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no government to overthrow here.</font>

33
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:32,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not overthrowing.</font>

34
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're overthrowing if I say so!
- Nice irony.</font>

35
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we focus on this?
Because now this is happening.</font>

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,591
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello everyone.</i></font>

37
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be alarmed, I'm attending our meeting
using what's called a telepresence robot.</font>

38
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I resent the idea that this would alarm me.</font>

39
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:53,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">These bots have been
revolutionizing the private sector,</font>

40
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now the state of Colorado
has come to us with a unique...</font>

41
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:05,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proposition.</font>

42
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:07,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seamless, Frankie.</font>

43
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Department of Corrections will
pay us money, if we allow a small,</font>

44
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:15,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">manageable number of inmates
to attend Greendale using these.</font>

45
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hold on.</font>

46
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:19,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to tell me that
prisoners would use these things,</font>

47
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:23,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">to come to our school?</font>

48
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:22,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the black guy
in every sci-fi movie.</font>

49
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll allow it.</font>

50
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:29,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Prisoners? Rolling
around the school with students?</font>

51
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll rape us. They'll rape us all.</font>

52
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't rape you, because their
genitals will be hundreds of miles away.</font>

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">From each other?</font>

54
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an attempt at rehabilitation.</font>

55
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prison is looking for
ways to expose their inmates</font>

56
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a real world academic environment.</font>

57
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:49,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I've heard enough.</font>

58
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:53,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm responsible for this school. I won't have
hardened criminals exposing themselves to it.</font>

59
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:55,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the response they're
getting from everyone,</font>

60
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:59,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why the state is
offering a $300,000 incentive.</font>

61
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:03,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll do it. Dean, do it.
$300,000 for the school.</font>

62
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're convicts.
- They're iPads on sticks.</font>

63
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:09,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">As someone that got paid to
keep people out, let me tell you.</font>

64
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys, I'm moon walking.</font>

65
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:15,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not every bad guy ends up in prison,
and not every prisoner is a bad guy.</font>

66
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's this guy?
- 300,000!</font>

67
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

68
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:22,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey you know, ordinarily
I'd do anything you say.</font>

69
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it. Let's do it.</font>

70
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:28,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I walked into that one.
- Gross, who farted? Oh wait, nevermind.</font>

71
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad you talked me into this.</font>

72
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:07,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">$300,000, look at us running
the school together, now.</font>

73
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm running the school, pay me more.</font>

74
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:14,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I made you Professor Emeritus?</font>

75
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could have a little ceremony.</font>

76
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does it pay more?
- No.</font>

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then give me what the ceremony would cost.</font>

78
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:25,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, folks welcome. I believe
you all have maps of our campus.</font>

79
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your Dean, Dean.</font>

80
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if I see any race gangs
forming, I will have no choice</font>

81
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:36,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to adjust the contrast on your
screens until you all look the same.</font>

82
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have a very strict no bullying
policy that relates directly to me,</font>

83
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">so be nice, to me.</font>

84
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:45,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need to be nervous.</font>

85
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all here because we've
done some bad stuff, but...</font>

86
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ain't here to do anymore.</font>

87
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:53,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very folksy, thank you.</font>

88
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess just...</font>

89
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll forth and rehabilitate.</font>

90
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:14,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, knock it off.</font>

91
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one at this school should
pick on any class of people,</font>

92
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like watching
magicians bully jugglers.</font>

93
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Willy.</font>

94
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy. Take a seat.</font>

95
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Mr. Jeff Winger. I
teach fundamentals of law.</font>

96
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:32,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that mean you can
teach me how to get out?</font>

97
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably not.</font>

98
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a phony lawyer, I got caught,
and now I teach a pretty phony class.</font>

99
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:38,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an automatic A.</font>

100
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:43,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you might learn a thing or two.
And I mean literally a thing or two.</font>

101
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool?</font>

102
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, and they call me the criminal.</font>

103
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me.</font>

104
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:52,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the main difference
between us is an orange jumpsuit.</font>

105
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have an iPad.</font>

106
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I'm a murderer.</font>

107
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now, don't worry. I ain't proud of it.</font>

108
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't hide it.</font>

109
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, once you take another man's life,
the least you can do is carry it with you.</font>

110
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:14,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you carrying any murders, Mr. Winger?</font>

111
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not.</font>

112
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:23,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you have to have strong
feelings for someone you kill.</font>

113
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to reserve that stuff for myself.</font>

114
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that's enough law.</font>

115
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to watch Planet Earth?</font>

116
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:39,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, ice worlds, oh the majesty.</font>

117
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhinos and elephants and flamingos.</font>

118
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:48,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed.</font>

119
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you been in our
apartment longer than Annie?</font>

120
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, I remember
when she first moved in.</font>

121
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was when I was so worried about pacing</font>

122
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was constantly laying
groundwork for pop back gags.</font>

123
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Annie.</font>

124
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:02,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to make this moment worth popping
back to from some point in the future.</font>

125
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that means.</font>

126
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:05,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

127
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. It will pay off.</font>

128
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Troy.</font>

129
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad I kicked that habit
it was getting a little joyless.</font>

130
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I'm saying is by Annie's logic.</font>

131
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying I was first in the
apartment, so I could overrule Annie</font>

132
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let you have a party, but I
don't get anything out of parties.</font>

133
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like conventions for every subject
too boring to have their own convention.</font>

134
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And instead of Joss
Whedon the police show up.</font>

135
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police also showed up when you
made Leonard take off his clothes</font>

136
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:26,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">and filled the livingroom with lizards.</font>

137
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was for my movie Reverse Godzilla. I
also thought it might make a good pop back.</font>

138
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:33,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make movies, Britta.</font>

139
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make movies, Annie makes
rules, you make parties.</font>

140
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her rules cancel out your parties, but
I'm not involved, I just make movies.</font>

141
00:07:57,096 --> 00:08:00,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, evening, Mr. Winger.</font>

142
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:03,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy. You're here late.</font>

143
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, taking some night classes,
trying to take full advantage, you know?</font>

144
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:10,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your car? It's nice.</font>

145
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you're taking
full advantage, too.</font>

146
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's a real dream gig.</font>

147
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, sarcasm.</font>

148
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slick words.</font>

149
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cock of the walk.</font>

150
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:22,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are categories in Prison Jeopardy?</font>

151
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:26,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you mind helping
me out with something?</font>

152
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I lost a ball-bearing
that rolled down them stairs.</font>

153
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:29,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lost a ball-bearing?</font>

154
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

155
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down them stairs.</font>

156
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to look down these stairs?</font>

157
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

158
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just try to murder me?</font>

159
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to murder me?</font>

160
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying as hard as
you can right now to kill me.</font>

161
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:07,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well I guess I'll
see you in class tomorrow?</font>

162
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:11,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy who tried to murder me.</font>

163
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:15,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh I'll see you in class
tomorrow, Mr. Winger.</font>

164
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:19,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will see you.</font>

165
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll see you.</font>

166
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oy vey.</font>

167
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'll see you tomorrow...</font>

168
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger.</font>

169
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:42,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we are having a party?</font>

170
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie. You know me better than
that. This is all set dressing.</font>

171
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm helping Abed produce his next film.</font>

172
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's Party, based on a
true story of fun and no rules.</font>

173
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

174
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:55,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fade in before a party.</font>

175
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:59,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">People start coming
over, way more than eight.</font>

176
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:00,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">It becomes a rager.</font>

177
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:05,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone has a great time and parties
like there's no tomorrow, then they leave.</font>

178
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophia cleans up.</font>

179
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:06,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The end.</font>

180
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:09,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're very interested in
you for the role of Sophia.</font>

181
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see the real time stakes
of Can't Hardly Wait,</font>

182
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">the subversive raunch of Risky Business,</font>

183
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the mumbly pointlessness
of everything after 2003.</font>

184
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but real.
- Totally real.</font>

185
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:18,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first movie to capture
the heart of a real party.</font>

186
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sensation that there's no tomorrow.</font>

187
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">The transcendence of time and mortality.</font>

188
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:24,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bravo, Britta, very clever.</font>

189
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? Don't look at me, I could never
green-light a project this big.</font>

190
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I moved in third. I'm a coucher.</font>

191
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:34,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's a coucher!
- I sleep on a couch!</font>

192
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!</font>

193
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:43,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good night.
- Good night.</font>

194
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:47,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

195
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before this is over, you'll
beg for my forgiveness.</font>

196
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:05,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we have an ultimately low stakes,</font>

197
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:08,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">but nonetheless creepy problem
with one of our Wi-felons.</font>

198
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean, Willy?</font>

199
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, what else did he do?</font>

200
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he steal a driver's ed simulator?</font>

201
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he start an illegal game
of solitaire on his face?</font>

202
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:17,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, he's in the room.</font>

203
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mr Winger.</font>

204
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is he on your laptop?</font>

205
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came to me for a chat this morning.</font>

206
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:27,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here for an education Jeffrey,
and he reports to the prison.</font>

207
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you do a little more in
your class than show Planet Earth?</font>

208
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:33,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling on me?</font>

209
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to murder me last night.</font>

210
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

211
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:38,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now hold on.</font>

212
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now where I'm from, you
accuse somebody of something,</font>

213
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">you better have evidence,
or he better be a minority.</font>

214
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to push me downstairs.</font>

215
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous.</font>

216
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was ridiculous,</font>

217
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:50,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is not someone who should
be interacting with students.</font>

218
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:52,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're seriously
taking his word over mine?</font>

219
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, have you ever killed anyone, Jeffrey?</font>

220
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:59,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would an actual murderer wanna
kill a community college teacher?</font>

221
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:01,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm not worth murdering?</font>

222
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I lie? Isn't that your specialty?</font>

223
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:04,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a raconteur.</font>

224
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:07,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You charm people with
your slick and fancy words.</font>

225
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy.</font>

226
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy just charms them.</font>

227
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:12,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

228
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:14,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should leave you two alone.</font>

229
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got classes.</font>

230
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us came here to work.</font>

231
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:23,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jealousy isn't a crime Jeffrey, but
costing the school $300,000 will be.</font>

232
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:26,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">So be a good teacher,
especially when Willy's watching.</font>

233
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:35,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why they call it yard juice.</font>

234
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next question.</font>

235
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:39,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you get to pick your number?</font>

236
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone ever get their
head stuck between the bars?</font>

237
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call it getting metal ears.</font>

238
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh hi, Mr. Winger.</font>

239
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:47,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought we'd sneak in a little
learning before the movie.</font>

240
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's no movie today, so
everyone roll to your seat areas.</font>

241
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:52,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes sir.</font>

242
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:56,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, law.</font>

243
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Law is simply put,</font>

244
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:01,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">an agreement we all make to do our
best to stay out of each others way.</font>

245
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:04,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a more technical
definition, Mr Winger?</font>

246
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't know Willy.</font>

247
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't cotton much to
fancy words and book study.</font>

248
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not how I got to where I am.</font>

249
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get to be
where you are, Mr. Winger?</font>

250
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:15,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you born?</font>

251
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger was born in dirt, Willy.</font>

252
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as you I'm sure.</font>

253
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I had my face held down in
that dirt by the kings of dirt and</font>

254
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:32,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">now they're still there,
ruling over dirt and I got out.</font>

255
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:36,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">By talking, by lying.</font>

256
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:40,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in case you hadn't noticed
it seems to beat being a bully.</font>

257
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett?</font>

258
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, when did you stop being funny?</font>

259
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, I mean, am I wrong?</font>

260
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or does he seem really intense here?</font>

261
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you're born in the
dirt, you'll die in the dirt.</font>

262
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kings of the, who are
the kings of the dirt.</font>

263
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's so charmed by him
because he's a violent criminal.</font>

264
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's also a petty sociopath,
and the more I try to point that out,</font>

265
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">the pettier I look.</font>

266
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weren't you the one that
championed this program?</font>

267
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:18,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't have worn that petard if
you didn't want to be hoisted by it.</font>

268
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:22,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think the expression hoisted
by your own petard is referencing?</font>

269
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I just assume that in the
old days a petard was a special outfit</font>

270
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a leotard with a lot of
fancy buckles and loops on it.</font>

271
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that rich people would wear them
when they were feeling especially smug.</font>

272
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:38,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then poor people could tie a rope
to one of the loops and hoist them</font>

273
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:42,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">up a pole and then let them dangle
there as punishment for being cocky.</font>

274
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never look it up.</font>

275
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your explanation is way better.</font>

276
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:49,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">But also the next time a friend
comes by with their problems,</font>

277
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe lay off the I told you so's.</font>

278
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we're having a Britta party here.</font>

279
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you be a little
bit less of a buzz kill?</font>

280
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was great.</font>

281
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now party like there's no tomorrow.</font>

282
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

283
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:04,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no tomorrow.</font>

284
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:07,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Party like it.</font>

285
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:16,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

286
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:21,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just do some
business in the background for now?</font>

287
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi everybody.</font>

288
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:23,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't worry.</font>

289
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:25,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not here to bust up your party.</font>

290
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know most of you are like thirty.</font>

291
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:31,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here because Frankie
Dart has exciting news.</font>

292
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:37,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have all been very cooperative
with this inmate education program.</font>

293
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:39,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Department of Corrections
is very, very happy.</font>

294
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:43,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means Greendale is going to be rich!</font>

295
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't tell anybody,</font>

296
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we smuggled in a few guests
to the party to celebrate with us.</font>

297
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone order a prison break!</font>

298
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plenty of convicts to go around!</font>

299
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:03,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take them to the dance floor.</font>

300
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass them around.</font>

301
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, really, pass them, yeah!</font>

302
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:12,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

303
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:15,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass Willy, pass me Willy.</font>

304
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

305
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:22,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, here you go, Willie.</font>

306
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep doing that!</font>

307
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:24,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep doing that.</font>

308
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try dancing harder.</font>

309
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:45,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that as hard as you can dance?</font>

310
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:49,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're at a party, you're celebrating.</font>

311
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:50,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

312
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's six in the morning.</font>

313
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:54,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thanks.</font>

314
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you've gotten enough shots?</font>

315
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's partied like
there's no tomorrow yet.</font>

316
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">They keep dancing like it's today.</font>

317
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:03,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay.</font>

318
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:05,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you joking?</font>

319
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the reason I signed onto this film.</font>

320
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's a performance issue.</font>

321
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:10,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this needed some real actors.</font>

322
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, lesson learned.</font>

323
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

324
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:14,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, from the top!</font>

325
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, action!</font>

326
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:16,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

327
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:21,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these people?</font>

328
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, Dean.</font>

329
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:23,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, Frankie.</font>

330
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Party!</font>

331
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Party, party.</font>

332
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">No tomorrow, guys.</font>

333
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:27,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

334
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mr. Winger.</font>

335
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I was thinking for class
today maybe you could, hey, whoa,</font>

336
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's going on?</font>

337
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.</font>

338
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:39,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, now.</font>

339
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:40,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me down.</font>

340
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Willy.</font>

341
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

342
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a murderer.</font>

343
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:49,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I be as cool as you now?</font>

344
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:50,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

345
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy!</font>

346
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

347
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:59,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy, talk to me, talk to me.</font>

348
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:00,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't see anything.</font>

349
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:04,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy, Willy, focus on my voice.</font>

350
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm losing you.</font>

351
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:07,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not losing me.</font>

352
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are going to a better
place with a stronger signal.</font>

353
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy?</font>

354
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy?</font>

355
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy!</font>

356
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on here?</font>

357
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">He started it.</font>

358
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

359
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are on sabbatical.</font>

360
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:23,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do that.</font>

361
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:24,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes I can!</font>

362
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two weeks paid sabbatical,
get him out of here,</font>

363
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's banned from the campus.</font>

364
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are on sabbatical.</font>

365
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on sabbatical, sir.</font>

366
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:37,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll go on my own, with
dignity, something you should look up.</font>

367
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:39,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't look it up.</font>

368
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You destroyed my device, and my heart.</font>

369
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You destroyed his device
and his heart, sir.</font>

370
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:47,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm going.</font>

371
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy!</font>

372
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy!</font>

373
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.</font>

374
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to find a parking spot for my house.</font>

375
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:03,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it must be so cool living in a vehicle.</font>

376
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

377
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:05,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your poop go?</font>

378
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tank.</font>

379
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gross!</font>

380
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a house.</font>

381
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:10,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, aren't you homeless?</font>

382
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I poop in a house.</font>

383
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:13,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose?</font>

384
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try.</font>

385
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:18,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.</font>

386
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

387
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:22,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your movie coming?</font>

388
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amazing, Abed's a genius.</font>

389
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's actually having a hard
time deciding what to cut, so</font>

390
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's going to be in two
volumes and it's hard to sleep,</font>

391
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's worth it because it's a movie.</font>

392
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a party.</font>

393
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like my help?</font>

394
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

395
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you learned anything?</font>

396
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:42,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't question rules.</font>

397
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rules are good.</font>

398
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bad. All hail Annie.</font>

399
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:45,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

400
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

401
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:49,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice of you to show up.</font>

402
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">We moved here for you.</font>

403
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:52,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask for this.</font>

404
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:54,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have your meeting at school
without me, I don't care.</font>

405
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean's using the study
room for the ceremony.</font>

406
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:57,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">That ceremony?</font>

407
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:58,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?</font>

408
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dean's making that convict
you murdered into a professor.</font>

409
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

410
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you care?</font>

411
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:06,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the Dean is just doing this to
prove something and it's really stupid.</font>

412
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy's dangerous and
he's manipulating him.</font>

413
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that what you usually do?</font>

414
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:12,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

415
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, yes, but not like that.</font>

416
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied to the Dean for personal gain.</font>

417
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't use him emotionally.</font>

418
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't mislead him.</font>

419
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't hurt him.</font>

420
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:26,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever thought of
saying that, to the Dean?</font>

421
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:28,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

422
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:30,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to him.</font>

423
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:30,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going to him.</font>

424
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait that's the whole point.</font>

425
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't go to him.</font>

426
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:37,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get on campus.</font>

427
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:38,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet murderers can.</font>

428
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have I done?</font>

429
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:40,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murderers can get on campus.</font>

430
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:46,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need a broom, a remote
control car, an iPad and</font>

431
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">an elaborate gyroscopically
stabilized servomotor.</font>

432
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, we're trying to help Jeff here.</font>

433
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're acting kind of spoiled right now.</font>

434
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Party, party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, party, party,</font>

435
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:01,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">party, party, party, party,
party, party, party, cut!</font>

436
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

437
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta has something to say.</font>

438
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">My script is misleading.</font>

439
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:17,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's impossible to party
like there's no tomorrow.</font>

440
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, it's based on a true...</font>

441
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's based on my desire to have a party.</font>

442
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:28,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parties are just booze, low lights,
and loud music, so people can feel</font>

443
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">more, see less, and not have to
listen to each other or themselves.</font>

444
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:35,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's stupid.</font>

445
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parties are stupid.</font>

446
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm stupid.</font>

447
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're shooting a stupid movie.</font>

448
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:45,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a wrap!</font>

449
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:49,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, we're done here.</font>

450
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gonna happen to me?</font>

451
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be punished in
ways you won't understand for</font>

452
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:15,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">longer than you think
is rational or possible.</font>

453
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:19,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then one day, you'll do
something he likes and he'll stop.</font>

454
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And eventually, you'll either
adapt or lose your mind.</font>

455
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

456
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls.</font>

457
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls.</font>

458
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a prison warden,</font>

459
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:39,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know all too well how rare stories
of true rehabilitation can be.</font>

460
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:44,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this Dean and this prisoner stand here
together today to prove that the dream is real.</font>

461
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for the ceremony.</font>

462
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:48,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last name?</font>

463
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:52,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geller, prisoner ID 042098.</font>

464
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go on.</font>

465
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm here for the cere...</font>

466
00:22:58,564 --> 00:22:59,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice night sir.</font>

467
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Craig Pelton, do you
accept responsibility for</font>

468
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">any damage incurred by hiring a felon?</font>

469
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

470
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willy Seibert Smith,</font>

471
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:17,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you accept that the 13th amendment
abolished slavery for everyone but</font>

472
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:21,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">convicts, and that we have no choice
but to pay you $0.13 per hour or less.</font>

473
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:22,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

474
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:23,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awe.</font>

475
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let us make official
this symbolic union.</font>

476
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:26,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it.</font>

477
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

478
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean.</font>

479
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree there's no reason you
shouldn't give this guy my job.</font>

480
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it, Jeffrey.</font>

481
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:33,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear it.</font>

482
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:36,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't do it before I
tell you some things that</font>

483
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:38,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been getting away with not saying.</font>

484
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody get this maniac out of here.</font>

485
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet, Willy.</font>

486
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:42,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this by prison rules.</font>

487
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what you have to say.</font>

488
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:46,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I like my job.</font>

489
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mind coming to work here.</font>

490
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel kinda guilty when
I pretend to be sick.</font>

491
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I try to steal as little
as possible, just the basics.</font>

492
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pens, coffee filters,
toilet paper, and one time,</font>

493
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">an overhead projector and a roll of carpet.</font>

494
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:06,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't lead you on, and I never will.</font>

495
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:10,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm not just a pretty
face that murders people and</font>

496
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">tells you what you wanna
hear, I'm less than that.</font>

497
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:20,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a gorgeous face that works
for you and considers you a friend.</font>

498
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey.</font>

499
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:23,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now to be fair.</font>

500
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:26,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys know Willy's
an innocent man, right?</font>

501
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shut your mouth, Warden.</font>

502
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's true.</font>

503
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">His appeal is in motion.</font>

504
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:30,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's new DNA evidence.</font>

505
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:31,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a good fella.</font>

506
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrongfully convicted.</font>

507
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a murderer?</font>

508
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can explain.</font>

509
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how the mighty have fallen.</font>

510
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch!</font>

511
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

512
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this by community college rules.</font>

513
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight!</font>

514
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight! Fight!</font>

515
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:50,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight!</font>

516
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight! Fight!</font>

517
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I pulled a plug.</font>

518
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:01,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go broom.</font>

519
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:01,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

520
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it on.</font>

521
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:05,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so violent.</font>

522
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">You punch like a girl.</font>

523
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:07,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

524
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

525
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you've got?</font>

526
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:13,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what I got.</font>

527
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's do it.</font>

528
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:16,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

529
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:20,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah, Jeffrey!</font>

530
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

531
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:23,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who's falling?</font>

532
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:26,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Willy!</font>

533
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa.</font>

534
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

535
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:35,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Dean.</font>

536
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, Dean.</font>

537
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:40,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

538
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

539
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go Mr. Winger.</font>

540
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go.</font>

541
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:53,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, I am not participating in this.</font>

542
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell kind of school is this?</font>

543
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:01,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thanks for coming on
short notice, is everyone here?</font>

544
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:05,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think so, it's hard to
tell without side cameras.</font>

545
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:08,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, why am I moving?</font>

546
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:09,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my custom background working?</font>

547
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I can't.</font>

548
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's WASD to move it.</font>

549
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been the same since the
invention of the keyboard.</font>

550
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, nerd.</font>

551
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:19,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you've heard, the rehabilitation
program has been aborted,</font>

552
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we lost that money.</font>

553
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:25,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, we no longer have to build
67 ramps so we should break even.</font>

554
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:26,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you all hear that?</font>

555
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:30,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a kid outside throwing
tennis balls against my RV.</font>

556
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it really necessary for us to
use these things for this meeting?</font>

557
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:40,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I think there's
something wrong with mine.</font>

558
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get a better connection.</font>

559
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:46,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't entirely necessary, but
the prison is selling these units</font>

560
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a discount so I thought I'd
run their offer by the school.</font>

561
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:50,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

562
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:51,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

563
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine's broken.</font>

564
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:53,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not it's not.</font>

565
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a janitor on it right now.</font>

566
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Britta's being arrested.</font>

567
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:01,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have every right to be here!</font>

568
00:27:01,056 --> 00:27:03,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think scared of you, but not!</font>

569
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:05,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that's it.</font>

570
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how much
windows cost John McEnroe?</font>

571
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off my lap!</font>

572
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop fighting technology.</font>

573
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:11,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I vote yes, we should
get these, they're cool.</font>

574
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:14,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I vote no, people shouldn't
have to be everywhere at once,</font>

575
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes we need to do our own thing.</font>

576
00:27:16,142 --> 00:27:18,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, where are you?</font>

577
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:20,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing my own thing.</font>

578
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:22,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is there tile behind you?</font>

579
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:25,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please tell me you're not doing
the thing, I think you're doing.</font>

580
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the same tile we have
in our apartment's bathroom.</font>

581
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

582
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang.</font>

583
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go.</font>

584
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:32,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god.</font>

585
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:33,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I gotta go too.</font>

586
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:34,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

587
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it we're passing on their offer?</font>

588
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they're just amateurs.</font>

589
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:40,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Initiating override protocol.</font>

590
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:43,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">All in favor of this purchase?</font>

591
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Affirmative.</font>

592
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:47,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well, Abeds commence
with world domination.</font>
