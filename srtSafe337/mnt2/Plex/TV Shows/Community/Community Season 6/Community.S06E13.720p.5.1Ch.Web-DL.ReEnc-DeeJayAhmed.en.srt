00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:13,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, Greendale students!</font>

3
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've pulled off another
year and we're still standing.</font>

4
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:20,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that, health inspector, building
inspector, foundation inspector,</font>

00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:24,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">water line inspector, geologist,
exterminator, plumber, and dad.</font>

6
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha ha ha.</font>

7
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:35,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo hoo.</font>

00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

9
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why bring a metronome?</font>

10
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:52,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the sound might accentuate
the anxious idleness of our last</font>

11
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:53,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">meeting's final seconds.</font>

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job, bad idea.</font>

13
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:56,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that is done.</font>

14
00:00:56,115 --> 00:00:56,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay! There's more!</font>

16
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one is exciting.</font>

17
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to rename the
Save Greendale committee,</font>

18
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">due to the fact that
Greendale is done being saved!</font>

19
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:12,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's more exciting than summer?</font>

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, am I stealing your rays, dude?</font>

21
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, it's neat!</font>

22
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our mission is finally
accomplished, once and for all,</font>

23
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:21,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">so what do we call ourselves now?</font>

24
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">The accomplishers.</font>

25
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">The obsoletists.</font>

26
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steven King's dreamcatchers.</font>

27
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Susan. You guys are
rebelling against yourselves.</font>

28
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:27,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get that, right?</font>

29
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">The current trend in branding is unique,</font>

30
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:32,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">simplistic, phonetically
memorable gibberish.</font>

31
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about nipple dippers?</font>

32
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like nipple dippers.</font>

33
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:36,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You guys.</font>

34
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Ooh, nippledippers. com is available.</font>

35
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:40,045

00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done. Nipple dippers, listen up.</font>

00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Special celebration.</font>

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just finished entire semester
without wearing a single silly outfit.</font>

41
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

42
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even notice.</font>

43
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:54,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good for him.</font>

44
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:57,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh.</font>

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey everybody!</font>

46
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:04,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it!</font>

47
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, I binged pretty hard there
after the bell rang but, I made it!</font>

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys going out
to celebrate or something?</font>

49
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll tag along, it's been
a tough year, I could use a drink.</font>

50
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:18,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were gonna to Britta's bar whenever
- Oh.</font>

51
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother time is willing to call it a year.</font>

52
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:24,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kay fine, we're done, happy summer.</font>

53
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:25,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nipple dippers drink for free!</font>

54
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pay for my drinks, I'm
not acknowledging that title.</font>

55
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone owes me ten bucks for the domain.</font>

56
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be able to join you.</font>

57
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta get on the road to California.</font>

58
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:34,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a job through Linkedln.</font>

59
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:35,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

60
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:36,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's crazy!</font>

61
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">People use Linkedln?</font>

62
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:42,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Linkedln hired me to help
figure out why people don't use it.</font>

63
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I have an old lady friend
I went to high school with who</font>

64
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:48,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">just became un-married last week
and I thought I'd look her up.</font>

65
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, you work fast.</font>

66
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or actually, very slow.</font>

67
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:52,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, good luck.</font>

68
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming back Elroy?</font>

69
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.</font>

70
00:02:55,338 --> 00:03:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably, maybe.</font>

71
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a great summer.</font>

72
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:08,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woah!</font>

73
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys think bars scene always
have to start at a billiards shot?</font>

74
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:45,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you think every time someone
takes a shot a in billiards they start</font>

75
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">a new bar scene without knowing it?</font>

76
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

77
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can just say shut up Abed.</font>

78
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:51,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, ask me if I'm coming back?</font>

79
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you coming back?</font>

80
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:54,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

81
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably.</font>

82
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:57,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

83
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean what was that, right?</font>

84
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was an Irish goodbye.</font>

85
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's give it an Irish wake.</font>

86
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:03,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six years guys.</font>

87
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nipple dippers.</font>

88
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nipple dippers.</font>

89
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:07,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Annie?</font>

90
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:10,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean no offense to you guys but
she's the only one that gets me.</font>

91
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said she had an interview?</font>

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six years.</font>

93
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six seasons, right Abed?</font>

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't put a nickel in him.</font>

95
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop mitigating everyone.</font>

96
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Abed, what happens in season seven?</font>

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

98
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:23,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how likely season seven is.</font>

99
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what show ever
peaks after season six?</font>

100
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simpsons, Seinfeld, South Park, Friends.</font>

101
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:30,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those shows weren't hemorrhaging
characters every year.</font>

102
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't like that word, hemorrhaging.</font>

103
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see what I can do.</font>

104
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Shirley came back, would
that change your disposition?</font>

105
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley could get us back on formula,
but I don't see it turning us around.</font>

106
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, what's our formula?</font>

107
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, basically.</font>

108
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a placeholder so set up it,
makes analogies look like punchlines.</font>

109
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">My setup lacks awareness,
but my punchline doesn't know.</font>

110
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:00,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abusively cynical one liner
dismissing everything you just said.</font>

111
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absurd reaction.</font>

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, can we put a pin in the
B story and focus on the A story?</font>

113
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust A stories.</font>

114
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never have, never will.</font>

115
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a set up about a story
that was so placeholder,</font>

116
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">the punchline came five words early.</font>

117
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can tag it too.</font>

118
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

119
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just take a moment to explain the
risks involved in all decisions made</font>

120
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">from here until eternity.</font>

121
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

122
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:20,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Frankie Dart.</font>

123
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this combination gonna work?</font>

124
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my place to say.</font>

125
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

126
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lizard.</font>

127
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire hydrant.</font>

128
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obama.</font>

129
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:31,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shane!</font>

130
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:38,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I put time into
what I do wardrobe wise.</font>

131
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:40,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah see, Shirley, no Shirley,
what does it matter, right?</font>

132
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we're not formulas, and if I had
no self-awareness, I think I'd know.</font>

133
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things have a certain
structure to them, you know?</font>

134
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we stray from it, we're weird,
if we stick to it, we're boring.</font>

135
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but isn't that more about
the shape of your brain, Abed?</font>

136
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, no offense or anything.</font>

137
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:55,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But isn't the shape of
your brain kinda fucked up?</font>

138
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. What's your season seven pitch?</font>

139
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pitch for your fall semester at
Greendale is that everyone is nice and</font>

140
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:02,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">has fun and grows together.</font>

141
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley or Elroy?</font>

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, that's racist, man.</font>

143
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley or Elroy?</font>

144
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's racist.</font>

145
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about they both come back?</font>

146
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about there's a
whole third black person?</font>

147
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:13,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do they all sit?</font>

148
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:17,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">They well they sit wherever they
want to sit, as of the 1960s.</font>

149
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:20,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sit.</font>

150
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:22,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sit.</font>

151
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pitch it.</font>

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't pitch it.</font>

153
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:24,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pitching it.</font>

154
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:30,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what?</font>

155
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:34,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made something.</font>

156
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:38,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a belt with fabric.</font>

157
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">How cute is that?</font>

158
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think that's very cute,
so oh, and I love you guys.</font>

159
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:49,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got, I'm angry and you
should vote or don't vote.</font>

160
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:49,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet!</font>

161
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hallelujah!</font>

162
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are good times, baby.</font>

163
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good times girl, good times.</font>

164
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I thought of something.</font>

165
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we should go to the
to the to the, to to the market.</font>

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we should.</font>

167
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, wouldn't that be like a
thing we saw, and didn't we do that?</font>

168
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">So shouldn't we be more ashamed and clever?</font>

169
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make everything more difficult?</font>

170
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:09,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and I think we should be deeply sad.</font>

171
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm nuts.</font>

172
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:11,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm happy.</font>

173
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm happy too.</font>

174
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:17,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know, hallelujah, and church,
and singing, and street wisdom.</font>

175
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

176
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy, and racist, and terrible!</font>

177
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree. You're being
way too linear about this.</font>

178
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, Elroy, Troy,
Hickey, living in the past.</font>

179
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Season seven don't need no past.</font>

180
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you pitching?</font>

181
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't pitch!</font>

182
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my pitch.</font>

183
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:46,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that includes all notes and</font>

184
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">business as it pertains to the files.</font>

185
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you guys doing?</font>

186
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Babe, how you doing, girl?</font>

187
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:52,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cool, it's all good.</font>

188
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, you're looking fine.</font>

189
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

190
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what about me?</font>

191
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:56,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey everybody, look at me!</font>

192
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:58,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ice cube head!</font>

193
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got an ice cube for a head.</font>

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also eat cell phones, so you
better be careful with those</font>

195
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">cellphones about me, because they
taste like prime rib where I'm from.</font>

196
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh ho ho, boy.</font>

197
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:10,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine the times we'll
all get in together,</font>

198
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:13,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially when I use my powers
to help solve all your problems.</font>

199
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:19,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa whoa whoa whoa,</font>

200
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:25,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's getting crazy in here!</font>

201
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:26,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm going home.</font>

202
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:27,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

203
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we just finished year
six, and it was hard work.</font>

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't really care about Greendale.</font>

205
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:38,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't wanna spend my brief moment
of humanity doing conceptual riffs,</font>

206
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">developing the imaginary
TV show of our lives.</font>

207
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, terrible improv.</font>

208
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ice cube head?</font>

209
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were just looking at your drink.</font>

210
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Busted.</font>

211
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie?</font>

212
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got the internship.</font>

213
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:54,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got the internship!</font>

214
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna intern for the FBI.</font>

215
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll leave in a week.</font>

216
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be in DC all summer.</font>

217
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're leaving the nest.</font>

218
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have your bedroom?</font>

219
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't come back,
if you don't come back.</font>

220
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm definitely coming back, probably.</font>

221
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe, maybe, maybe.</font>

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, next order of business.</font>

223
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, Garrett's
holding Leonard's hand again.</font>

224
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:19,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, stop doing that.</font>

225
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm checking for a pulse.</font>

226
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, hands off the Leonard dice.</font>

227
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:27,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Question, when can we start
the next paintball game?</font>

228
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think he can force it.</font>

229
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of things can be forced,</font>

230
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:35,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a human head through
a six-inch drain pipe.</font>

231
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Just kidding, pal.</font>

232
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, did anyone on the
sustained Greendale committee</font>

233
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">do any of their assignments this week.</font>

234
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scrunch.</font>

235
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, bro.</font>

236
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't work for you.</font>

237
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work for me.</font>

238
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the tech billionaire that bought
this dump and cuts your paycheck.</font>

239
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can call that a paycheck.</font>

240
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen more zeroes over Pearl Harbor.</font>

241
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were hundreds of them.</font>

242
00:09:56,374 --> 00:10:00,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sky was black with smoke bombs.</font>

243
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double click this, Winger.</font>

244
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:05,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your job to work.</font>

245
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is our job to party.</font>

246
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hatch harebrained schemes.</font>

247
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get laid.</font>

248
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get laid.</font>

249
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:14,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">And eventually leave you here as well.</font>

250
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you okay?</font>

251
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

252
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I, I was taken aback.</font>

253
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's big news.</font>

254
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you guys been doing?</font>

255
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:34,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just looking for ways
to make season seven work.</font>

256
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean we've got through six seasons.</font>

257
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean what's up with that?</font>

258
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's season seven?</font>

259
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:39,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean we gotta figure out season seven.</font>

260
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe we could just hang out.</font>

261
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.</font>

262
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night was so insane,</font>

263
00:10:56,994 --> 00:11:00,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">it made the insane clown posse look
like the well-adjusted clown posse.</font>

264
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:03,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be hard work running
away from your own age.</font>

265
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone seen my e-cigarette?</font>

266
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">There should be a charity
for people like you.</font>

267
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

268
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if can keep making
the commute from here to the FBI</font>

269
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:10,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">headquarters.</font>

270
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, Abed, I'll have to move back in.</font>

271
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:15,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I moved in with them.</font>

272
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, we have files.</font>

273
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving out.</font>

274
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:19,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem stressed, Annie.</font>

275
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:22,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are those last few criminology credits
you need hard to get at Greendale?</font>

276
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:25,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. The only credit that it's hard
to get at Greendale is from a bank.</font>

277
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:28,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, they have schools for
this kind of stuff at Quantico.</font>

278
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:32,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being with you guys is great, but
why is this a good choice for me?</font>

279
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why doesn't the audience feel sorry for me?</font>

280
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, your parents have been murdered.</font>

281
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">By whom?</font>

282
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:39,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police won't touch it.</font>

283
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're calling it a double suicide.</font>

284
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:45,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I got this.</font>

285
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:48,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're proposing a version of the
show in which Annie comes back, and</font>

286
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:50,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">it hinges on the murder of my parents.</font>

287
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a placeholder.</font>

288
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying there's always
gonna be a need for law at Greendale.</font>

289
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:56,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember the ass crack bandit?</font>

290
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I remember? I mean.</font>

291
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't everybody.</font>

292
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could have been anybody.</font>

293
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is with this diaper thing?</font>

294
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it about shaming me?</font>

295
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:10,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really want a bunch
of people dressing you?</font>

296
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be polite to try.</font>

297
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:13,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to see you interested
in this stuff, Jeff, but</font>

298
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:14,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't watch that season.</font>

299
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, neither. You wanna
know a perfect season seven?</font>

300
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't count the reasons I should stay.</font>

301
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:25,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">One by one, they all just fade away.</font>

302
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what Senator?</font>

303
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were allowed to call us terrorists
before we moved to international</font>

304
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">waters, but we're a nation now.</font>

305
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:33,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess this is fucking war.</font>

306
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I'm gonna need
you to go to Washington.</font>

307
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared. Be more scared than that.</font>

308
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:38,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

309
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">The protesters are scared.</font>

310
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:41,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need you to talk to them.</font>

311
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should be scared, but</font>

312
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">they shouldn't need a leader
to tell them what to do.</font>

313
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:48,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all born free into a world of lies.</font>

314
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let's talk about
you for a second, though.</font>

315
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm not a joke anymore.</font>

316
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm strictly transgender.</font>

317
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:54,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not all this other stuff.</font>

318
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:58,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I represent the transgender
community, and it's a real thing.</font>

319
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not crazy, but I do have flaws.</font>

320
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:01,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm smart.</font>

321
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:04,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this other stuff, glad
to be of service, Britta.</font>

322
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want my diaper back.</font>

323
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even own a TV
and I wouldn't watch that.</font>

324
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yeah, what's your pitch?</font>

325
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well I, I mean, it's
not that complicated is it?</font>

326
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:28,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

327
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:29,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

328
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

329
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's everyone?</font>

330
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

331
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have.</font>

332
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:36,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could learn about science or
history it's set in a school, after all.</font>

333
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't we learning?</font>

334
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know that's not enough, so.</font>

335
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so on.</font>

336
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo.</font>

337
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:52,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's possible there is more
skill to it than I thought.</font>

338
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:53,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, yes.</font>

339
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is skill to it.</font>

340
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:58,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">More importantly, it has to
be joyful, effortless, fun.</font>

341
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">TV defeats it's own purpose
when it's pushing an agenda, or</font>

342
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:06,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to defeat other TV or being
proud or ashamed of itself for existing.</font>

343
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's TV, it's comfort.</font>

344
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:15,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a friend you've known so well,
and for so long you just let it be with</font>

345
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:21,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and it needs to be okay for it
to have a bad day or phone in a day.</font>

346
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it needs to be okay for it to
get on a boat with Levar Burton and</font>

347
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">never come back.</font>

348
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because eventually, it all will.</font>

349
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine. I know.</font>

350
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:39,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just that.</font>

351
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just such a classic mistake but.</font>

352
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got really attached to my pitch.</font>

353
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a sound track in
my head and everything.</font>

354
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I agree with Abed.</font>

355
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have an effortless pitch.</font>

356
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

357
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how's this semesters
crop of apples looking?</font>

358
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's been out rotting.</font>

359
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:03,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Asian kid in my math class,</font>

360
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:06,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't want to study because he
doesn't want to be a stereotype.</font>

361
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:06,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty funny.</font>

362
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like a strong B story.</font>

363
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can say that without throwing
anyone because I teach TV appreciation.</font>

364
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:13,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang you can send that student to
me and we'll make it more serious.</font>

365
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the school shrink I can
wear these glasses every episode.</font>

366
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are super hot in them.</font>

367
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:17,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

368
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:18,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very hot.</font>

369
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm. This gives me a more solid
reason to interact with you than</font>

370
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:22,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">a stupid committee.</font>

371
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way I'm a lesbian.</font>

372
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:25,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I haven't hit on Jeff.</font>

373
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:26,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

374
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:28,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's my deal, I teach criminology.</font>

375
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:32,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">But look, it's the original Annie.</font>

376
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:36,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm grown up and I'm
hot, but not little girl hot.</font>

377
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:38,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm happy and we're all
together and it makes sense.</font>

378
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just might live the good life yet.</font>

379
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi! Dean!</font>

380
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I told you not to come
into the teachers lounge,</font>

381
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're supposed to be in dean class.</font>

382
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I learn to be dean if
I can't hang out with teachers?</font>

383
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're supposed to be shaping minds,
but we keep shaping each other.</font>

384
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it in.</font>

385
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this version, will you
tell me what to do a lot?</font>

386
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I on meds in it?</font>

387
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:09,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm mellow and relatable.</font>

388
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:11,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it.</font>

389
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:14,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would love to teach at Greendale,
and I do miss wearing skirts.</font>

390
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you shallow a
horse pill size contrivance,</font>

391
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:17,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would open up new areas and dynamics.</font>

392
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:18,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's evergreen.</font>

393
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:20,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well great that's settled.</font>

394
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:21,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we make it real?</font>

395
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, maybe you should start
looking into education classes.</font>

396
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:25,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">You too, Abed. Well,</font>

397
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:29,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should probably tell you guys
that I'm moving to Los Angeles.</font>

398
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:29,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

399
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:32,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like a real TV executive I was
letting you guys work your ass off,</font>

400
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">because there's no profit
in saying no to an idea, but</font>

401
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">now that it's time for me
to commit I have to pass.</font>

402
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a job as a PA on a Fox
show, it's in a video game studio.</font>

403
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like 30 Rock, meets
IT Crowd, meets, well me,</font>

404
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm growin' up That's so great Abed.</font>

405
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:46,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations Abed.</font>

406
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:47,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so happy for you.</font>

407
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're coming back right?</font>

408
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

409
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably.</font>

410
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:58,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

411
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's six seasons and a movie.</font>

412
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff I know it comforts you to look
at things through that metal lens,</font>

413
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is reality.</font>

414
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">TV's rules aren't based on common sense.</font>

415
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:08,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're based on the studio wanting
to milk their properties dry.</font>

416
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here here.</font>

417
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers to that and cheers to Abed.</font>

418
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:12,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers!</font>

419
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:27,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, Jeffrey?</font>

420
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:28,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

421
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so on.</font>

422
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:52,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie I'm home.</font>

423
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there.</font>

424
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:55,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was your day?</font>

425
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did anything funny happen?</font>

426
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:57,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares.</font>

427
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was your day?</font>

428
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Sebastian did some drawing.</font>

429
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sebastian?</font>

430
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's look at them.</font>

431
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sebastian.</font>

432
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:06,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sebastian.</font>

433
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to your child area.</font>

434
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:12,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw. I love you.</font>

435
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

436
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this really what you want?</font>

437
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

438
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:24,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'd be fine with a dog too.</font>

439
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:25,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, whatever you want.</font>

440
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:27,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea what I want?</font>

441
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:28,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

442
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:41,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you get in here?</font>

443
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:42,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled the spare key so</font>

444
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dean would stop leaving
them under the welcome mat.</font>

445
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left weirdly.</font>

446
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's no normal
way to do anything now.</font>

447
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:52,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

448
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be fine, you know.</font>

449
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna be fine.</font>

450
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be 25 and heading
out into the world.</font>

451
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:05,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna fall asleep on a beach and
be able to walk the next day, or</font>

452
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">stay up all night on accident.</font>

453
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna wear a t-shirt without
looking like I forgot to get dressed.</font>

454
