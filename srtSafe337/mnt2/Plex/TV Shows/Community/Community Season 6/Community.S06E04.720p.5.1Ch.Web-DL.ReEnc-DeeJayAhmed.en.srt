00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parts plural?</font>

147
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well yeah, Annie got my part
and I got the Asian part.</font>

148
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:42,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang... Stop!</font>

149
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were cast as Mr. Miyagi
and the Karate Kid,</font>

150
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:47,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're a good team!</font>

151
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a team, because
one of us is so talented</font>

152
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">she got cast outside her
gender and the other one,</font>

153
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">got cast because
of eye shape.</font>

154
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:58,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not letting you
sabotage yourself like this.</font>

155
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say you're right.</font>

156
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">And like Sidney Poitier or Meg Ryan
before you, you were cast for race.</font>

157
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what the actor does with
the role they get, that matters.</font>

158
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right?
- You're right.</font>

159
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, IT lady.
How goes it?</font>

160
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I found your problem.
- And?</font>

161
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need a little time to fix it.</font>

162
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, need time to fix it?</font>

163
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sound just like
you work in IT.</font>

164
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got some
interesting news,</font>

165
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">the school board,
offered me a position.</font>

166
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh.
- Great.</font>

167
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

168
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I got a part in a play and
we were sort of talking about that,</font>

169
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">so read the room Pelton.</font>

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna
take the job?</font>

171
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:44,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know,
there's a catch.</font>

172
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, Frankie, could I see
you in my office please?</font>

173
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want you to be
a token homosexual?</font>

174
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a form of progress,
30 years ago,</font>

175
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most power an openly gay could
achieve was a center square.</font>

176
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I'm not just gay.
- What does that mean?</font>

177
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">If coming out is
a magic show,</font>

178
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gayness is the rabbit
out of the hat,</font>

179
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm one of those
never-ending handkerchiefs.</font>

180
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sad truth, Craig?</font>

181
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:16,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything other than straight,
is plenty gay for a school board.</font>

182
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most important point is, are you
prepared to make your sexuality,</font>

183
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is nobody's business,</font>

184
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:26,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">an aspect of your
role in society?</font>

185
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:28,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I'm not, so I don't.</font>

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

187
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:33,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a person becomes symbolic
they gain symbolic power,</font>

188
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:36,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the price of
independent power.</font>

189
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:38,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. That's an excellent point.</font>

190
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:42,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be good for Greendale, for one
of our own to be on the school board.</font>

191
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:44,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean the fact that
you'd be leaving a few items</font>

192
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">off your list of your
turn-ons, I mean,</font>

193
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:51,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">the goal in politics, isn't
transparency, it's winning.</font>

194
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's why the politicians always win.
- They do always win, don't they?</font>

195
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:59,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I get a chance to win. I could
change the system from the inside out.</font>

196
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all I have to do is pare down
my sexuality to simple gayness,</font>

197
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- which is heavily in the mix.
- There you go.</font>

198
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:09,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready, America.</font>

199
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Pelton is coming out as approximately
two-sevenths of what he is.</font>

200
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Don't
leave me hanging.</font>

201
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

202
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so curious.</font>

203
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Intellectually.</font>

204
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:29,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

205
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a pretty
basic scene.</font>

206
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">No real subtext. Let's just
get it up on its feet.</font>

207
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no wrong answers.
Okay? Great. Go.</font>

208
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come fix faucet.</font>

209
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Karate, learn
from book?</font>

210
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:58,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And a few classes back at
the Y in Jersey where I'm from.</font>

211
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened I?</font>

212
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I guess there are wrong answers.</font>

213
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick adjustment, Ben.</font>

214
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:08,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Act better. Act better.</font>

215
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:11,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Annie, you're doing great.
Keep doing what you're doing.</font>

216
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:11,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

217
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:15,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I ask about by motiv...
- Keep me from puking is your motivation.</font>

218
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop making me want to quit
the theater and kill myself.</font>

219
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:20,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. After "What happened I."</font>

220
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Okay.</font>

221
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. I fell off my bike.</font>

222
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. Lucky no hurt hand.</font>

223
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

224
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see this tool box?</font>

225
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. This is good. Got it.</font>

226
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:43,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got distracted cuz the tools
were doing a better job than you.</font>

227
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened I? Say it.</font>

228
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened I.</font>

229
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:50,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liar. Stop lying to me.
Say it.</font>

230
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:53,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened I.
- What happened actor?</font>

231
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You crying?</font>

232
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cry when
I tell you to cry.</font>

233
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:03,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">So reabsorb that disgusting droplet of salt
and bad choices back into your doughy body.</font>

234
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then call your mother
to see if you can be reabsorbed</font>

235
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">back into her doughy
body or so help me God,</font>

236
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:11,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will take that tear, I will freeze it,
and I will stab you in the eye with it,</font>

237
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:14,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">you waste of a soul-shaped
hole forgotten by God.</font>

238
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

239
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:18,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">What should I...</font>

240
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, don't change a thing, you're
perfect. Unless you want to.</font>

241
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

242
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:34,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right I'm Rich Countee, this is my
man Carl. We work on the school board.</font>

243
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, we do.
- We have some exciting news for you.</font>

244
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:39,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your own dean,
Craig Pelton,</font>

245
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:43,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been selected to join the board
of Colorado Community Colleges,</font>

246
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll just, go,
go ahead Dean.</font>

247
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys. Talk.</font>

248
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Hello Greendale.</font>

249
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know, this is something
I wanted for a very long time</font>

250
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wanted to thank all
of the people at Greendale</font>

251
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:02,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">that helped me achieve this
and my partner, Domingo.</font>

252
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:07,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very proud of my Craig.
- Oh, that's, but, oh, oh.</font>

253
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now let's open it
up to some questions.</font>

254
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean.
- Dean.</font>

255
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:13,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a gay dean, what is your opinion
about the recent controversy</font>

256
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">surrounding the cancelled
Pride Parade,</font>

257
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:17,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">and do you think you were
selected to join the board</font>

258
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- because of your sexual preference?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

259
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would just like to say that we are very
proud to have Mr. Pelton on the board,</font>

260
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever his
lifestyle may be.</font>

261
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which happens to be gay!</font>

262
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:31,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is great,
but irrelevant!</font>

263
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it gets better!</font>

264
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh good. We're so happy.</font>

265
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel like scum.
- Gay people are scum?</font>

266
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't play that
card with me young man.</font>

267
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make gayness look
like Mormonism.</font>

268
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like being
this dishonest.</font>

269
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:51,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I want to say
thanks for doing this.</font>

270
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew. I mean,
people talked, but...</font>

271
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:56,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, well, it really doesn't
have anything to do with my work.</font>

272
00:13:56,388 --> 00:14:01,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's helpful, to me.
You know, and to a lot of us, so.</font>

273
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

274
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:07,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

275
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confine yourself
to your role, Domingo.</font>

276

<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hit water,
or old mayonnaise.</font>

290
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the air after
a fart has dissipated.</font>

291
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:17,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not hitting you.</font>

292
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the worst actor
I've ever directed</font>

293
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've directed
both Wahlbergs!</font>

294
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the top!</font>

295
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:27,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Danny does a bit with the floor
sanders, Miyagi is amused,</font>

296
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:31,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Kenny gets me another god damned
cup of coffee with six Splendas in it!</font>

297
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hare Krishna.</font>

298
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's so mean to Chang.
I don't know what to do.</font>

299
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could just drop
out of the play.</font>

300
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:48,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know I could.
Or Chang could.</font>

301
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:50,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the director is
not being mean to me.</font>

302
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you talked Chang
into auditioning</font>

303
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then you got his part
and now he's suffering.</font>

304
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're right, I should threaten to quit.
- Or just quit.</font>

305
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:04,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I threaten to quit maybe that will
be enough for him to stop abusing Chang.</font>

306
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was kind of born
to act, Britta.</font>

307
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I do it, I can feel
it pleasing the universe.</font>

308
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's dramatic.
- See?</font>

309
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">The internet says that if they're sparrows
they'll be flying in less than 12 days.</font>

310
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:29,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they're albatrosses,
we're in trouble.</font>

311
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albatrosses have a 270
day fledgling period.</font>

312
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for guarding
the nest with me.</font>

313
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:46,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

314
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what you do
when you're working?</font>

315
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be nice.</font>

316
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look. There's a
bird's nest in the router.</font>

317
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you want
to fire me, fire me.</font>

318
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, until those birds are
gone nobody gets any closer.</font>

319
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well of course not.</font>

320
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you move them the mother
won't come back.</font>

321
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep up the good work.</font>

322
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me wax on.</font>

323
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the worst acting
I've ever seen in my life.</font>

324
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me wax, off.</font>

325
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ghost of your father
just turned his back on you.</font>

326
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ancestors are
clawing their way</font>

327
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">deeper into the Earth
to get away from you,</font>

328
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">you make me embarrassed
to have thumbs,</font>

329
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see air
quotes around you.</font>

330
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me, paint fence.</font>

331
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock, knock, knock,
anybody home?</font>

332
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh look, there's nobody
here, oh it's so dusty,</font>

333
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's almost like nobody's
been here in years.</font>

334
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a note.</font>

335
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Never let me act."</font>

336
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Lundergard, I'm sorry, but I
cannot stand by while you do this.</font>

337
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fine, you can go.</font>

338
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not bluffing.</font>

339
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't make an actor more
talented by yelling at them.</font>

340
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you don't stop, your lead
character is going to walk.</font>

341
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lead?</font>

342
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">You play Danny LaRusso.</font>

343
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I'm the Karate Kid.</font>

344
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:12,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Karate Kid is
about Kesuke Miyagi,</font>

345
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">an immigrant who fought against
his own people in World War II,</font>

346
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">while his wife lost a child
in an internment camp.</font>

347
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:22,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noriyuki Morita was nominated for
an Academy Award for his performance.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ralph Macchio? Showed up.</font>

349
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:30,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cast you because your measurements allow
me to use the same wardrobe as last year.</font>

350
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cast Ben because
he has the sadness</font>

351
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">and talent that could
make this show great.</font>

352
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I have to physically
drill into his chest</font>

353
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">and suck it out
with a straw!</font>

354
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:44,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can take
a flying kick</font>

355
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a rolling donut!
You're fired.</font>

356
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm talented,
too, right?</font>

357
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No. Really? Really?</font>

358
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my God! You're like doing a
terrible Vinnie Barbarino up here.</font>

359
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, like, I know you're not
capable of anything better,</font>

360
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, that's why I've been
so nice to you.</font>

361
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take care Annie.</font>

362
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yikes, right?</font>

363
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a diva.</font>

364
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- No problem?</font>

365
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on,
she's dead to us.</font>

366
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey gay Dean, we got
a problem here.</font>

367
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ring the local papers?</font>

368
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:27,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've shut down the campus Wi-Fi
until a nest of baby birds can grow?</font>

369
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a little too gay.</font>

370
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do it because I'm gay.
Wait, I'm not gay.</font>

371
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that did not
just get said to us.</font>

372
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are gay. You are
openly gay and we love it.</font>

373
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now we are dealing with
more flak from conservatives</font>

374
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">for appointing you than we ever did
from gays for not having one of you.</font>

375
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and the gays aren't
coming to your side.</font>

376
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:48,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why? Because the whole
point is to get a job by being gay</font>

377
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:50,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then to do as good
of job as the normals.</font>

378
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what the gays want.</font>

379
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:55,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't want a gay dean who
acts like a weird gay monster.</font>

380
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a gay dean.
- Whoa, not cool, man.</font>

381
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't bring us into
your web of lies.</font>

382
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,</font>

383
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:07,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- now what do you want me to do?
- Figure it out, gay dean. Figure it out.</font>

384
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:12,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Domingo.
- Hey, what's up?</font>

385
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, the school needs Wi-Fi,
and my job is to run the school.</font>

386
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">The school doesn't
need baby birds.</font>

387
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:25,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The nest needs to be moved.
- You are not crossing this line.</font>

388
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm taping this. This is on video.
- Guys...</font>

389
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:34,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is two white security guards versus
one unarmed black man and two baby birds.</font>

390
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your move.</font>

391
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand down. Stand down.</font>

392
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:40,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">No security, no weapons.</font>

393
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:46,807

one unarmed, openly gay dean.</font>

394
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now move that nest, please.</font>

413
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,557

with a beak and hollow bones</font>

432
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a special magnet in its
head it uses to migrate.</font>

433
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You skipped wings.
- Insects have wings.</font>

434
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:41,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

435
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:45,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Abed. I lost myself
in a role. It won't happen again.</font>

436
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:46,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two of them died.</font>

437
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one left. He's hanging on,</font>

438
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm worried he's turning into
a symbol of my own innocence.</font>

439
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't Chang's play tonight?</font>

440
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">If any of you go, you're
supporting abuse.</font>

441
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, dial it back, Annie.
- Oh.</font>

442
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm definitely in.</font>

443
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:04,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be interesting to see how his fake
crying is different from his real crying.</font>

444
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:06,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I'm a big fan of
the performing arts,</font>

445
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:08,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll go to Chang's play anyway.</font>

446
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?</font>

447
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?</font>

448
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:14,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karate Kid adaptation?</font>

449
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karate Kid adaptation?</font>

450
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:33,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I might.
I'm catching up.</font>

451
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Directors have a saying.</font>

452
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actors are worthless,
empty-headed homunculi,</font>

453
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:49,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the right one,
in the right role</font>

454
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:50,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">can change the world.</font>

455
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm,</font>

456
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have found
the right one.</font>

457
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's found the right
role, and tonight,</font>

458
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">your world changes.</font>

459
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

460
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:19,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He replaced me with Annie Kim.
- Shh.</font>

461
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hee-ah!
- Ow.</font>

462
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. You okay?</font>

463
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:26,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be the new
people in apartment 20.</font>

464
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:30,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was that? Karate?
- Yeah, you know?</font>

465
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:33,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, me and some of my friends are
gonna have a party at the beach later.</font>

466
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should come.</font>

467
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:38,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey! Are you the repair man?
- Aye.</font>

468
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:41,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Faucet's really leaking there.
- Aye.</font>

469
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When are you gonna fix it?
- After.</font>

470
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">After what?</font>

471
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">After, after.</font>

472
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:53,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come ask, leave boy
alone to train.</font>

473
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:57,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a lot of nerve, old man.
But I like that. I like that.</font>

474
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Name a place.
- Tournament.</font>

475
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sergeant Miyagi.</font>

476
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:10,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. Regret
to inform wife, sir.</font>

477
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:17,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Complication at birth, sir.</font>

478
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:22,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doctor, it can't.</font>

479
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:26,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

480
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

481
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please forgive me.
- Shh.</font>

482
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need fight anymore,
you proved point.</font>

483
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? That I could
take a beating?</font>

484
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I see
those guys,</font>

485
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll know they
got the best of me.</font>

486
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close eye.</font>

487
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, Daniel.</font>

488
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up!</font>

489
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, woo woo!</font>

490
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:24,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right, LaRusso?
- Yeah, you missed my head.</font>

491
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did it, Mister Miyagi.
We did it.</font>

492
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm speechless.
- I forgot Chang was up there.</font>

493
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:37,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

494
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:42,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's such a relief to be able to support
him out of something other than fear.</font>

495
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess all that suffering
Chang endured paid off.</font>

496
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not what the play suggests,
but you have to wonder</font>

497
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it wouldn't have been better
for Daniel to get beat up even more.</font>

498
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:52,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am at a total loss about what
lesson to learn from any of this.</font>

499
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe that's the lesson.
- Hm.</font>

500
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I lost a button.
- Maybe we all lost a button.</font>

501
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey guys!</font>

502
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:05,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much.</font>

503
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:10,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, thank you for making me do this.
- You're welcome. Congratulations.</font>

504
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm jealous.
- No, no, don't be.</font>

505
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, I sit
in my dressing room</font>

506
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:18,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all I dream about is a
white picket fence and a dog.</font>

507
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have those either.</font>

508
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, let's go.</font>

509
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess all the actors go to some
sort of actor bar together.</font>

510
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'll see you guys at school.
Bye.</font>

511
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I know this great bar for
people that don't hate themselves.</font>

512
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:43,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say?</font>

513
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

514
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord.</font>

515
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:57,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are gathered here today to celebrate
the release of this bird into these skies.</font>

516
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">That its now fully formed wings may
find purchase upon the four winds.</font>

517
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone would like to say
something, now's the time.</font>

518
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:11,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'll always remember how you
kept me from getting email for a week.</font>

519
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that chirp you do
when you want more bread.</font>

520
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that one.</font>

521
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now everyone, please put on
your cat masks and finger wings.</font>

522
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">With these cat masks, we remind you that
this place can no longer be your home,</font>

523
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">but with the fluttering
of these wings,</font>

524
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">we symbolically join your
flight into the natural world.</font>

525
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wings everyone.</font>

526
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You can go now.</font>

527
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Off you go.</font>

528
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:45,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to go, little bird,
that's just the way it is.</font>

529
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whee!</font>

530
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

531
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then it's done.
- You did the right thing, Abed.</font>

532
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to you, that bird has his
whole bird life ahead of him, to fly,</font>

533
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">meet lady birds, even
start a bird family.</font>

534
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made a difference.</font>

535
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw.
- Abed.</font>
