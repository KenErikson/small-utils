highlights of the lunch lady's e-mails.</font>

but once they're online,</font>

49
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">does anyone really own
the lunch lady's emails?</font>

59
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:20,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see a few familiar faces here.</font>

00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:21,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few new ones, as well.</font>

61
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, just gonna keep the cop you've
known for five years at arms length?</font>

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.</font>

63
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you boys been able to figure out?</font>

64
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call us boys.</font>

65
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:30,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's a unique case,</font>

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's hard to decide
what laws are being broken.</font>

67
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you count the lunch lady's sex life.</font>

help our situation.</font>

79
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we make of the demands?</font>

80
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well we were able to
find out a little more.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">This message was posted
online and signed, The Hackers.</font>

00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to his name.</font>

90
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the message says if you don't
cancel his performance, what happened</font>

91
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the lunch lady's gonna happen to
everyone on the activities committee.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, see ya.</font>

107
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm gonna call
a press conference and</font>

113
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">To rise to the occasion.</font>

114
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">To not let these hackers push us around.</font>

115

<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you guys think that
we have an obligation here?</font>

116
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:33,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cop says no.</font>

117
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:37,853

trunk has something to do with 9/11.</font>

eyes of something bigger?</font>

123
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,033

<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you saw what they
did to the lunch lady.</font>

150
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna guess how much
better my emails are?</font>

151
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to call a press
conference and say, now do me?</font>

152
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'll do it.</font>

153
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them leak me.</font>

154
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not letting you do this alone.</font>

155
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:13,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw it.</font>

156
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:16,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.</font>

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has to be the last to stand
up, and now that someone isn't me.</font>

158
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:24,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kinda zoned out and assume
we're standing to go see Avengers.</font>

159
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:27,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys are giving hackers a bad name.</font>

160
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hacker is already such a dumb name.</font>

161
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:33,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not an idealist, I'm a pragmatist.</font>

162
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's never pragmatic
to piss you guys off.</font>

163
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:39,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, fine.</font>

164
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys.</font>

165
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so inspiring.</font>

166
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess, just let me know how it goes.</font>

167
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what happens I'm with you,
but don't tell anyone I'm with you.</font>

168
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:51,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do, I'll deny it, but
I'm with you here and now.</font>

169
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not literally here and
now, right now I'm leaving,</font>

170
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:56,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will always have
been with you secretly.</font>

171
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

172
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:03,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The performance by Gupta Gupti
Gupta will go on as scheduled tomorrow</font>

173
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">night, and we encourage anyone who
believes in freedom to attend Mr.</font>

174
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gupta's performance.</font>

175
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, as a woman, and someone
with many Jewish and black friends,</font>

176
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be deeply offended.</font>

177
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:18,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm petitioning to have Mr. Gupta
banned from all campuses across America.</font>

178
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:20,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, one thing at a time.</font>

179
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:24,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, freedom of speech does not
just apply to speech you want to hear.</font>

180
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:25,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Case in point, am I right?</font>

181
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:27,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely get my good side, right here.</font>

182
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:28,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm being censored!</font>

184
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm being censored!</font>

185
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, there's coffee
and scotch in the corner.</font>

186
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw the hackers and long live Greendale!</font>

187
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:41,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

188
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll see you guys at
sound check in the cafeteria tomorrow.</font>

189
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there is a good chance that
we are going to be targeted, so</font>

190
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">nobody gets on the internet tonight.</font>

191
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we say?</font>

192
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">No peeking at the leaking.</font>

193
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise, promise, promise?</font>

194
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

195
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:56,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

196
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

197
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for backing me up, a little.</font>

198
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:01,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you turned into the
path of least resistance.</font>

199
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deflect all you want, but you're putting
your ass one the line for an ideal.</font>

200
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe a fraction of
a butt cheek on the line.</font>

201
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like I used that stupid
Greendale email for anything</font>

202
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">but porn subscriptions and
improv show mailing lists.</font>

203
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:16,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think it's only your
Greendale email they'll be leaking?</font>

204
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they hacked Greendale.</font>

205
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a computer in your office?</font>

206
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:21,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

207
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you check your emails on that computer?</font>

208
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

209
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look at boobies on it?</font>

210
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time.</font>

211
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got it.</font>

212
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:33,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got everything.</font>

213
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Vietnam now, baby.</font>

214
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Vietnam!</font>

215
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways, like I said, thanks.</font>

216
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

217
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

218
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls.</font>

219
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:25,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie.</font>

220
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Francesca.</font>

221
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word around school is our
emails have been leaked.</font>

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that so?</font>

223
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the first you've heard of it?</font>

224
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I heard some rumblings.</font>

225
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, rumblings.</font>

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. Hm.</font>

227
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:46,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeff.</font>

228
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:47,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeff.</font>

229
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger.</font>

230
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:51,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.</font>

231
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

232
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie.</font>

233
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the hackers leaked our emails.</font>

234
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Something like that.</font>

235
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we help set up chairs?</font>

236
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

237
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:24,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something was wrong with that one.</font>

238
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:28,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad chair.</font>

239
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, how's everybody doing?</font>

240
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked a damn question.</font>

241
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:32,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

243
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">New look.</font>

244
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you like it.</font>

245
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:38,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd hate to think my wardrobe wasn't
passing muster with this group.</font>

246
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here I am in a brand new outfit
with an up-to-the-minute shirt.</font>

247
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

248
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not usually the best at
non-verbal cues, so I have to ask,</font>

249
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">is it possible that everyone here but me
read all of each other's leaked emails?</font>

250
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Absolutely not.</font>

251
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's possible.</font>

252
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read it all.</font>

253
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read all your crap.</font>

254
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have read everything you guys
have ever wrote about me in an email.</font>

255
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you guys are the
worst people in the world.</font>

256
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you guys.</font>

257
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not cool.</font>

258
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mean, mean, mean.</font>

259
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Point it at me and I will eat it!</font>

260
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:11,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

261
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will bite your little
finger off and I will eat it!</font>

262
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, let's see you type more
descriptions of my Houseguest-era Sinbad</font>

263
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:17,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">wardrobe.</font>

264
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah-ha.</font>

265
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a direct quote from a
really mean email I wrote about him.</font>

266
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now who's the bad guy?</font>

267
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:25,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. How much of the
leak did each of you read?</font>

268
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:26,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a right to fit in!</font>

269
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:27,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, stop it! Stop it!</font>

270
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we all just admit that we...</font>

271
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:31,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not admitting it.</font>

272
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:32,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie, get over it.</font>

273
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

274
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:38,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had my blood tested for amphetamines?</font>

275
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were extra jumpy last spring.</font>

276
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had to double check to be safe.</font>

277
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'm jumpy enough
if my friends can steal my blood.</font>

278
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:47,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you gave it to us.</font>

279
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">For that human genome project?</font>

280
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only used half of it for that.</font>

281
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, you're one percent Neanderthal.</font>

282
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:54,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew.</font>

283
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:57,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you judge anyone,
light switch licker?</font>

284
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like this, ew.</font>

285
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys hear that sound?</font>

286
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:03,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the sound of the hackers winning.</font>

287
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our school's out there right now,
pawing through our dirty laundry,</font>

288
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">laughing at us, waiting
to see what we're gonna do,</font>

289
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting to see who wins in the
battle between terror and cool.</font>

290
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to be cool, man.</font>

291
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to be cool.</font>

292
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:29,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">And set up for a show.</font>

293
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, if you wouldn't mind
please checking the sound system.</font>

294
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.</font>

295
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you're too busy
telling your girlfriend I</font>

296
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't understand Donnie Darko.</font>

297
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie. I'm cool.</font>

298
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll set up the box office.</font>

299
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:47,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, or will me opening a box
office unfairly influence wagers</font>

about my sexual preference?</font>

301
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw this one coming,
and we are so sorry.</font>

302
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:55,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that cuts it.</font>

303
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">The word sorry fills that
crater right to the brim, yeah.</font>

304
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boo hoo.</font>

305
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friends are curious
about your night life.</font>

306
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">We kept it among friends.</font>

307
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told human resources I
was a functional alcoholic.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I am required to file a
report on every teacher, and</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">if you throw another
tantrum I will revise yours.</font>

310
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what? Non-lethal murderer?</font>

311
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:18,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armless javelin thrower?</font>

312
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in your unqualified,
buzzword-bloated,</font>

313
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:25,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">little red school house of a
brain is a functional alcoholic?</font>

314
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in your brain is a chapstick lesbian?</font>

315
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me, 300 bucks.</font>

316
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you care to refute it.</font>

317
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sexuality is of zero concern
to my job and to everyone here.</font>

318
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear, if you people were
trapped on a tiger-infested island</font>

319
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no food or water, you would
judge every ship that came to save you.</font>

320
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:47,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does the tigers survive
without food or water?</font>

321
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's not cute, Annie.</font>

322
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I read your entry in the pool.</font>

323
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:54,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was your goal to win or just be disgusting?</font>

324
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to pick last.</font>

325
00:14:56,869 --> 00:15:00,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, we all read about
ourselves in your weirdly long,</font>

326
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">melodramatic emails to your sister,
who you might notice never responds.</font>

327
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a hint.</font>

328
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's dead.</font>

329
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:14,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pretend to write her
emails as a journaling device.</font>

330
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:17,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wretched, evasive little gremlin.</font>

331
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, why don't we just
call that rock bottom.</font>

332
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:22,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check one, check two.</font>

333
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:25,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check one, check two.</font>

334
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:29,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well, it looks like Jeff
Winger auto-paid his car insurance and</font>

335
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's book club has a meeting tomorrow.</font>

336
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you guys find the bad stuff?</font>

337
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:40,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe, maybe what we all need to
do here is have everyone in the room</font>

338
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">address and own one thing
that they know is out there.</font>

339
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">No blame, no shame.</font>

340
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just an explanation.</font>

341
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll start.</font>

342
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm sure by now, you've all
seen the emails between me and</font>

343
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Patterson family of Herndon, Virginia.</font>

344
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:52,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me. No.</font>

345
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I received their first letter
as part of a family email chain,</font>

346
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christmas of 2007.</font>

347
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you owe us.</font>

348
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, I, I didn't
understand why they'd written me.</font>

349
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I responded politely.</font>

350
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I realized they had somehow
mistaken me for their cousin.</font>

351
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:10,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some reason, I
suppose it was loneliness,</font>

352
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply failed to disabuse
them of that notion.</font>

353
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:13,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's...</font>

354
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to love Barb and
George, and Gelson and Roselle.</font>

355
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:21,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even Uncle Paul with all his flaws.</font>

356
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:24,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even though our relationship
is based on a lie, for me it's.</font>

357
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the realest, I'll ever know.</font>

358
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

359
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you don't think by explaining
that, you're off the hook for</font>

360
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:40,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">the 3D models you've been making of
our bodies without our permission.</font>

361
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:43,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what those photos were for?</font>

362
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm making a game about
lady time travelers.</font>

363
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where in your pants?</font>

364
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty creepy, Elroy.</font>

365
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys are so suave.</font>

366
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such gentlemen.</font>

367
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Chang have a daily
email chain ranking Annie and</font>

368
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:57,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta one and two.</font>

369
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">By which you mean, Chang emails me
rankings every day and I don't respond.</font>

370
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:05,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for February 7th, 2013.</font>

371
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, Britta is one, Annie is two.</font>

372
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, ha, yeah.</font>

373
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, gross.</font>

374
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Britta, way to instantly memorize
the exact date of your big victory.</font>

375
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:20,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, silver and gold,
ladies, ain't no losers there.</font>

376
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think we're losing
sight of what's important.</font>

377
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says the woman suing her father for $80.</font>

378
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell it to your fake family.</font>

379
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:30,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you made any creepy
boob models of Jezel yet?</font>

380
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jezel is like a daughter to me.</font>

381
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">But arguably more like a
daughter to her parents.</font>

382
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you have your own family?</font>

383
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:40,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, go write an astronaut.</font>

384
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, did anyone see Jeff's letters?</font>

385
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">He writes to astronauts.</font>

386
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk about creepy.</font>

387
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:46,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're national heroes!</font>

388
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they are!</font>

389
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave them alone.</font>

390
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, this I gotta see.</font>

391
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:51,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, what I don't want to see?</font>

392
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your exchanges with your life coach
about the study group when we were</font>

393
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">dating.</font>

394
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and by the way, clearly,
not a life coach, and absolutely,</font>

395
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:02,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">just an Italian sociopath
you met at a dispensary.</font>

396
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two dated?</font>

397
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a study group?</font>

398
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Chang was our teacher.</font>

399
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

400
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:12,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, and frankly,
haven't been well utilized since.</font>

401
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:19,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear Reid Wiseman, congratulations
on your successful return to Earth...</font>

402
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:20,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies.</font>

403
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Video games.</font>

404
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any more advice?</font>

405
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear new ensemble, I
love you more than my dad.</font>

406
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">What!</font>

407
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Gupta Gupti Gupta.</font>

408
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, hi.</font>

409
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, whatever.</font>

410
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:40,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

411
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:41,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys okay?</font>

412
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">To tell you the truth,</font>

413
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gupta Gupti, we've been
through a bit of a rough patch.</font>

414
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, the dean was telling me about
it and I've been reading about it.</font>

415
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope you were entertained.</font>

416
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:53,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest, I'm really grateful.</font>

417
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:58,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first school in six
months that hasn't canceled, so thanks.</font>

418
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:03,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get ready.</font>

419
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:10,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really did the right thing didn't we?</font>

420
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:11,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

421
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter what
we read in the leaks or</font>

422
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we said to each other tonight.</font>

423
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">What matters is that right
now here on this campus,</font>

424
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">the people are in charge.</font>

425
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the hackers.</font>

426
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the media, not the cops, the people.</font>

427
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, go put on some music.</font>

428
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:28,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elroy, Jeff, put out some more chairs.</font>

429
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie get ready to introduce our star.</font>

430
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, go talk to yourself in the corner.</font>

431
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:34,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, let the people in.</font>

432
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:47,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

433
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

434
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:01,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey, Neil.</font>

435
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

436
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole audience?</font>

437
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

438
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do a show for one person.</font>

439
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you kinda have to.</font>

440
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:12,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd rather not.</font>

441
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have to, jackass,</font>

442
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:16,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">because there's more at stake
here than what you'd rather do.</font>

443
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

444
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a new message from the hackers.</font>

445
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, quiet down!</font>

446
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, cut the music.</font>

447
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Greendale, your activities
committee has defied our demands, and</font>

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">the horrible racist comedian
is still about to perform.</font>

00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's right.</font>

450
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We beat you.</font>

451
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this performance goes on as scheduled,</font>

452
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:40,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of your information will be published.</font>

453
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:42,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do not want this to happen,</font>

454
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will find a way to
stop this performance.</font>

455
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Stop, stop, hey!</font>

456
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, Neil!</font>

457
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can stop me, but you can't stop
the people from stopping this show.</font>

458
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shhhh.</font>

459
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that?</font>

460
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:04,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God!</font>

461
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:07,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the people coming to stop the show.</font>

462
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what do we do?</font>

463
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to stop the people.</font>

464
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their freedom of speech depends on it.</font>

465
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, Chang, bar the doors.</font>

466
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:14,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, introduce him, quick!</font>

467
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:25,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna do this.</font>

468
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, you piece of crap, we've
been to hell and back for you.</font>

469
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up there and do your
stupid act for freedom.</font>

470
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

471
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:38,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, he's performed
at colleges and clubs all over.</font>

472
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:39,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gupta Gupti Gupta!</font>

473
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, y'all.</font>

474
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:48,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I see there's a
lot of Jews in the crowd.</font>

475
00:21:48,614 --> 00:21:53,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you know, there isn't, but
usually when I do my act, there's more.</font>

476
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you know, I have a whole Jew thing.</font>

477
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it!</font>

478
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

479
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this guy?</font>

480
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop performing!</font>

481
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not stop performing!</font>

482
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this guy.</font>

483
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:05,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him.</font>

484
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like he ate so much.</font>

485
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's very fat.</font>

486
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:09,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do this to me.</font>

487
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:11,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up and listen.</font>

488
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see that you're fat, but
are you also black or Jewish?</font>

489
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's hard to be
fat when you're black or</font>

490
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:21,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jewish because when you're black,
your community steals all your food, so</font>

491
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't eat as much.</font>

492
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:27,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you're Jewish,
nobody ever buys anything,</font>

493
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can't eat as much.</font>

494
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:34,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're damned if you do,
you're damned if you don't.</font>

495
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:39,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear God.</font>

496
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bastards did it.</font>

497
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:43,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">They leaked the entire school's data.</font>

498
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:55,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

499
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:57,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">So hey, fat guy in the audience.</font>

500
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:01,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you found anyone else you
could love, like another fat person?</font>

501
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:06,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, are you one of those fat
people who will always be alone?</font>

502
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Leonard, you enjoy
my girlfriend in 2009?</font>

503
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:22,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">As much as she enjoyed
your plagiarized poetry.</font>

504
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill you.</font>

505
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:26,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't act like you care about me.</font>

506
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen all of your cartoons about me.</font>

507
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am this school's worst nightmare!</font>

508
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:39,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a.</font>

509
00:23:39,057 --> 00:23:41,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, it's like Road Warrior out there,</font>

510
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if petrol were privacy and
bad teeth were dirty secrets.</font>

511
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news! Neil's talking to us again.</font>

512
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he respects our moral
position, but not our execution.</font>

513
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, he says he's never
talking to us again.</font>

514
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how we can
bounce back from this one.</font>

515
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:54,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one?</font>

516
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

517
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:57,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you follow a theme of revealed
secrets, the email hack is the third</font>

518
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">installment of a trilogy that
began with Annie losing a pen,</font>

519
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:01,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">in what I've come to call the Golden Age.</font>

520
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:04,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing the second chapter would
be when your best friend vanished on</font>

521
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:07,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">a mysterious boat trip after the
older one masturbated himself to death?</font>

522
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:08,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

523
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:11,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's one you guys bounced
back from, we might be okay.</font>

524
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the lesson here?</font>

525
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wanna make sure
I know what the lesson is.</font>

526
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a completist.</font>

527
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of the school's in shambles,</font>

528
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">so maybe we're more evolved
and forgiving than them.</font>

529
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">We already know that, stupid.</font>

530
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel more desensitized to
jokes about Jews and blacks.</font>

531
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that good?</font>

532
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what?</font>

533
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know the pieces of our
privacy, freedom of speech,</font>

534
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">terrorism, and government.</font>

535
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:34,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the lesson is
probably an ironic pairing,</font>

536
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">like one man's privacy
is another man's freedom.</font>

537
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government is terrorism.</font>

538
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only free speech is private speech.</font>

539
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">A free government terrorizes privacy.</font>

540
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all four, bitches.</font>

541
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terror is terrorized by...</font>

542
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:49,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terry the terrorist?</font>

543
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarry not, for terrorism terrifies.</font>

544
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government.</font>

545
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speech.</font>

546
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:58,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government.</font>

547
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:05,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">We caught the hacker.</font>

548
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:09,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Ryan, AKA
StringCheeseHustler, AKA Fartmitzvah,</font>

549
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:13,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Skullandboners88,
Frozensucked, Captaintitty.</font>

550
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:15,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need to know all his names.</font>

551
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lives across the
street from the campus, and</font>

552
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's got something he wants to say.</font>

553
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you? I'm sorry.</font>

554
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

555
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">For guessing your school
master password was changeme.</font>

556
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops.</font>

557
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you sleep at night, Warburton?</font>

558
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were one of us.</font>

559
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were free.</font>

560
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's free when they're one of anything.</font>

561
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:40,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to answer your question, I
sleep alone with one eye open.</font>

562
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I'm not the one in cuffs.</font>

563
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:48,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, Fartmitzvah.</font>

564
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crime doesn't pay.</font>

565
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:53,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crime doesn't pay.</font>

566
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crime doesn't pay.</font>

567
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry if I used photography to
digitally approximate some of your naked</font>

568
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:11,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">bodies.</font>

569
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:12,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

570
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is? No!</font>

571
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything?</font>

572
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:25,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as yesterday.</font>

573
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big cloud of data raining over a pasture.</font>

574
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">All 8 billion sheep keep grazing.</font>

575
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:35,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that good?</font>

576
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

577
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing you said back there
about not being a part of anything.</font>

578
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really how you feel?</font>

579
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:45,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a question of how I feel.</font>

580
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like flying.</font>

581
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't jump off buildings.</font>

582
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe in God, Warburton?</font>

583
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:56,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there's no rule that
says we have to be friends, right?</font>

584
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about common courtesy?</font>

585
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Familiar with that rule?</font>

586
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">The words common and
courtesy have opposite values.</font>

587
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Common courtesy is just
gibberish, hocus pocus,</font>

588
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:07,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">a spell we cast when
hoping to cheat reality.</font>

589
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a cynical son of a bitch.</font>

590
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you that.</font>

591
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:15,019

makes these dream catchers.</font>

00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the hell up.</font>
