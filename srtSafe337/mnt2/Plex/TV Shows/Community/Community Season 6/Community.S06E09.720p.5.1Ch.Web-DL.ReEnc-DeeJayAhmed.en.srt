1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you haven't even looked
at the new course catalog.</font>

2
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like a kid in a candy store.</font>

3
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:24,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the candy has lost its
appeal now that I work at the store.</font>

4
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:27,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might say becoming a
teacher here gave me diabetes.</font>

5
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just saying that.</font>

6
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:32,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you always thirsty and fatigued
and you have blurry vision and</font>

7
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:33,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">your cuts heal slower?</font>

8
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:35,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are actual diabetes symptoms.</font>

9
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:37,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what the doctor said.</font>

10
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, is he treating it?</font>

11
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:40,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked him the same thing.</font>

12
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

13
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:44,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, make an appointment through
his office during business hours.</font>

14
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is his home, his children sleep here.</font>

15
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:47,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know doctors.</font>

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh, you guys.</font>

17
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a class called Basic Grifting.</font>

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we all learn how
to be grifters together?</font>

19
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:56,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what do grifters do again?</font>

20
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this.</font>

21
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you for five bucks.</font>

22
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

23
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:01,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better sign me up Me too.</font>

24
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:04,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted to learn more
about grifting ever since I saw 1990's,</font>

25
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:06,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grifters, featuring John
Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and</font>

26
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:07,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">almost no grifting.</font>

27
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, don't take a grifting class.</font>

28
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to get grifted.</font>

29
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even more so than by that oceanography
class, only none of you will</font>

30
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:16,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">even get a goldfish, then you're
gonna come crying back to me.</font>

31
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:17,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why you?</font>

32
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, lets face it,</font>

33
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the closest thing that Greendale
has to an experienced grifter.</font>

34
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:26,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is one of those things where
Jeff gets jealous of something dumb.</font>

35
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's jealous of a grifter.</font>

36
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he wishes he was still a grifter</font>

37
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's something even I could
mock, and I live in an RV.</font>

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm judging you, and my dinner
table folds down from a wall.</font>

39
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:40,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we all take the grifting class
together, have a great time, and</font>

40
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">rub it in Jeff's face!</font>

41
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:43,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's in, and can you cover me?</font>

42
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:44,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pay you back.</font>

43
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it from your parents.</font>

44
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:46,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pay you back.</font>

45
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">At which point I'll pay back your parents.</font>

46
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:49,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which will be never.</font>

47
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get a high five from your parents.</font>

48
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, each student
should bring a briefcase.</font>

49
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a briefcase.</font>

50
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna grift with briefcases?</font>

51
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:00,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Basic my ass, that's advanced.</font>

52
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:01,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

53
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:02,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a few extra briefcases.</font>

54
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shocker. Are they regulation?</font>

55
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">We each need a regulation
grifting briefcase.</font>

56
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:06,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a grift.</font>

57
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a regulation briefcase?</font>

58
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

59
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're provided for only $150.</font>

60
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being grifted.</font>

61
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:13,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Jeff.</font>

62
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:15,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such a negative person.</font>

63
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:17,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you contribute to
this group besides negativity?</font>

64
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, watch this, can I borrow $150?</font>

65
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:22,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. See!</font>

66
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:26,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now who's gonna come with me
and show this guy what's up?</font>

67
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pay you back. I'll
get it from your parents.</font>

68
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them I spit on their
wealth and thank you.</font>

69
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.</font>

70
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:18,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Professor Roger
DeSalvo, for the time being.</font>

71
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">For I use many a pseudonym, such
as Jeff Goulash, Philip Switch,</font>

72
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">or Baz Ravish.</font>

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">For I am a grifter and
this is Grifting 101.</font>

74
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now which one of you thinks
I did that on purpose?</font>

75
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:42,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly, you think you've seen me fail.</font>

76
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:45,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you've spotted a weakness.</font>

77
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:49,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you something, with a flick
of a wrist, I could show you a fool</font>

78
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:53,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">one minute, or longer.</font>

79
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you've got your briefcases.</font>

80
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent. Hold them aloft.</font>

81
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass them to each other.</font>

82
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now pass them back.</font>

83
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it at speed.</font>

84
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quicker!</font>

85
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:11,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass them like hell.</font>

86
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:18,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass them like your sister's dying,
and continue that for about 40 minutes.</font>

87
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, 40 minutes?</font>

88
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name, my love?</font>

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie Edison.</font>

90
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like a real name,</font>

91
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:29,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">not the name of a grifter
and therefore, not a teacher.</font>

92
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

93
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:32,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

94
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.</font>

95
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:34,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not.</font>

96
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's correct. I was just wondering
what the next lesson will be.</font>

97
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:40,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next lesson will be
passing two briefcases.</font>

98
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to master the
art of passing one, and</font>

99
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you can purchase another briefcase.</font>

100
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You talk too much.</font>

101
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep passing.</font>

102
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:56,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a very funny book.</font>

103
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh no, grifters.</font>

104
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I better watch my french
fries unless, counterfeit?</font>

105
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you learn to do that?</font>

106
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't learn anything.</font>

107
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">That class is... A rip off?</font>

108
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, what's another word for that?</font>

109
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he did was throw his hat
and make us pass briefcases.</font>

110
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, he kept trying to sell us stuff.</font>

111
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Briefcase swapping talcum for
grifters palm, briefcase hinge oil for</font>

112
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">silence switcheroos, and something
called extra believable socks.</font>

113
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are actually half off, I
kind of feel like I grifted him.</font>

114
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in a sense, what happened is
you took a class about grifting.</font>

115
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:40,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aaaaaannnnnd... Jeff, you
really need us to say it?</font>

116
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were... Eh, whoa, whoa,
yeah I need you to say it.</font>

117
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me just get settled.</font>

118
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay go.</font>

119
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

120
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

121
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:57,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you live and you learn, guys.</font>

122
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you live anyway.</font>

123
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now, will you please help us?</font>

124
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:01,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help you?</font>

125
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:02,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want revenge.</font>

126
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:03,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanna grift him back.</font>

127
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:04,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna grift a grifter?</font>

128
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:06,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's as dumb as taking his class.</font>

129
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:06,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just cut your losses.</font>

130
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:07,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Jeff.</font>

131
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I begged you not to go down this
path, and you made fun of me.</font>

132
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pointed in my face and laughed.</font>

133
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry we hurt your feelings.</font>

134
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:15,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">My feelings are fine.</font>

135
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:18,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just very lazy, and you
gave me an excuse to do nothing.</font>

136
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not just gonna throw that away.</font>

137
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:20,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to take this guy down?</font>

138
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's even lazier than you.</font>

139
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't your species
consider that a challenge?</font>

140
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:28,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be on some kind of reverse
pissing contest to determine who's</font>

141
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:29,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">laziest?</font>

142
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, is that where you
suck it back up in your?</font>

143
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I've only ever
done it the other way.</font>

144
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean peeing?</font>

145
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean in the back.</font>

146
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't done anything to me.</font>

147
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy.</font>

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet we'd get along.</font>

149
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good show.</font>

150
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good show.</font>

151
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What show?</font>

152
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen that show.</font>

153
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

154
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the best.</font>

155
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, you are?</font>

156
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was the guy with a full bottle
of scotch and a high tolerance for</font>

157
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">foreigners.</font>

158
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">How robust.</font>

159
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd imagine that you're Jeff Winger.</font>

160
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out we're going to be office buddies.</font>

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello there, sir.</font>

162
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Roger DeSalvo.</font>

163
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is it?</font>

164
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:18,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, I happen to be
in the... Grifting 101.</font>

165
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I've heard about you.</font>

166
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be your desk.</font>

167
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you need a mnemonic device,</font>

168
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the one without someone
else's stuff all over it.</font>

169
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well played, very well played.</font>

170
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta say.</font>

171
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:33,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire your style.</font>

172
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grifting people by selling
them grifting lessons?</font>

173
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's genius, but I called it.</font>

174
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said my class was a grift.</font>

175
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't worry about me, I'm one of you.</font>

176
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was, anyway.</font>

177
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do tell.</font>

178
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:48,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I worked at one of the top law
firms in the city as a lawyer, but</font>

179
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">guess what.</font>

180
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a lawyer.</font>

181
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:54,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think you're talking about lying.</font>

182
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:56,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grifting happens to be an art form.</font>

183
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">The art of lying.</font>

184
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not get high-handed.</font>

185
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grifting is lying.</font>

186
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. So, like a string is a sweater?</font>

187
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, paint is the Sistine Chapel?</font>

188
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, grifting includes lying, but
only a liar would call grifting lying.</font>

189
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:11,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, only a delusional
hobo would glorify stealing.</font>

190
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Did you say something
that wasn't true there?</font>

191
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should phone the museum.</font>

192
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on your side.</font>

193
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:17,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an ass.</font>

194
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're a craftless, artless thug.</font>

195
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, I'm God's paintbrush.</font>

196
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:25,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I am God, which pretty
much makes me better than you.</font>

197
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

198
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's agree to disagree.</font>

199
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not important.</font>

200
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

201
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you can lie.</font>

202
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you liar.</font>

203
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

204
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna speak to you, you son of a bitch.</font>

205
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

206
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

207
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

208
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do too.</font>

209
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

210
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

211
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

212
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:03,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you guys still doing that?</font>

213
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:07,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was homework, and
we're getting better, right?</font>

214
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, the friction has gradually melted
the handle to fit into our palms.</font>

215
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to get better at.</font>

216
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">The class is a grift.</font>

217
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next person who says
grift is gonna grift!</font>

218
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">My god, now it's replacing other words.</font>

219
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm in.</font>

220
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:22,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's grift the son of a bitch.</font>

221
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!</font>

222
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you cheering?</font>

223
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could be saying anything.</font>

224
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

225
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

226
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

227
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

229
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift!</font>

230
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good work, I can't remember your name.</font>

231
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Likewise, no idea what your name is.</font>

232
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great job.</font>

233
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:01,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

234
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say you're pretty close to
swapping the briefcases loaded with</font>

235
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:09,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">actual fake money such as this.</font>

236
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't real money,
it's just cut up newspaper.</font>

237
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:14,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it weighs the same,
costs five dollars a piece.</font>

238
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be using ten.</font>

239
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Telegram for Elroy Patashnik.</font>

240
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:19,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Patashnik.</font>

241
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Telegram, sir.</font>

242
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:24,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

243
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Aunt Baba died on
vacation while in Africa.</font>

244
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:27,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

245
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she left me a million dollars, but</font>

246
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">the African government
wants to seize the funds.</font>

247
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Class dismissed.</font>

248
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you.</font>

249
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:43,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your mind?</font>

250
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? The African telegram.</font>

251
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Jim Belushi of grift?</font>

252
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to grift me?</font>

253
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:50,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll cut you in for fourteen grand.</font>

254
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

255
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:57,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out.</font>

256
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more thing.</font>

257
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try twice.</font>

258
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:06,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice? The fake grift within the
grift, or the double bean, if you like.</font>

259
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna mention a name and however
you react, I'll know the truth.</font>

260
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger, that's the one!</font>

261
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:17,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger? What with the, who?</font>

262
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the one.</font>

263
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out you go.</font>

264
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say hi to him.</font>

265
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:28,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, Jeff Winger, nice try thrice.</font>

266
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how was grifting class?</font>

267
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you teach some advanced grifting
techniques only you could understand?</font>

268
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Brown Betty?</font>

269
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Texas oil baby?</font>

270
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">The reverse Jim Gaffigan?</font>

271
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:44,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't teach
the African telegram.</font>

272
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I'm not a hack.</font>

273
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">And also, since the Internet.</font>

274
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

275
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:50,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got me.</font>

276
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:50,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Game over.</font>

277
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:56,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's end this competition
- Cheers to that.</font>

278
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, you.</font>

279
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:05,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy left his lottery
ticket on the table.</font>

280
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the telegram man.</font>

281
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:06,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it wasn't.</font>

282
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean what telegram?</font>

283
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

284
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">What telegram?</font>

285
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the Internet, you know?</font>

286
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:15,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">That place that you obviously went
to to type in the word grifting.</font>

287
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna grift you.</font>

288
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna grift your ass.</font>

289
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is that the grift?</font>

290
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of it is a grift!</font>

291
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:24,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all nonsense!</font>

292
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:29,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, how many times have I told
you people the faculty lounge is</font>

293
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:30,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">not a bar?</font>

294
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, pack it up people.</font>

295
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:35,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you don't have to go teach
a class but you can't stay here.</font>

296
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, truce.</font>

297
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:38,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

298
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise no more grifting and
promise, if this is worth a million,</font>

299
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll split it.</font>

300
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:45,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an idiot.</font>

301
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I'm a genius.</font>

302
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can answer that.</font>

303
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:49,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're definitely an idiot.</font>

304
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can an idiot walk backwards
like this and not hit anything?</font>

305
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe. Or, maybe not.</font>

306
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

307
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

308
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:10,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy is a grifter.</font>

309
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor of grifting.</font>

310
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">He charges $400, you
get two brief cases and</font>

311
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">your ex boyfriend becomes an obsessive.</font>

312
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you and Winger were lovers.</font>

313
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:23,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wanted my respect, he
should have opened with that.</font>

314
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to be disarming?</font>

315
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:28,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you grifting me out of my arms?</font>

316
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:28,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did nothing to that man.</font>

317
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called himself a grifter.</font>

318
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just simply corrected him.</font>

319
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:34,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, because the truth is so
important to the both of you.</font>

320
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's it gonna cost
to make you go away?</font>

321
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

322
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took the bait.</font>

323
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:49,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

324
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:50,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

325
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I thought we didn't
want him to take the bait?</font>

326
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, we're saying the same thing.</font>

327
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:55,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't take the bait,
we didn't want taken.</font>

328
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">The African Telegram?</font>

329
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:03,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, which was offered as fake bait
and taken as such, ie, not taken.</font>

330
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that made him feel in control.</font>

331
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:08,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by avoiding all visible bait, he
placed himself on the invisible hook</font>

332
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">of assuming we're planning to grift him.</font>

333
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:11,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I like it.</font>

334
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:12,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

335
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:12,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">And.</font>

336
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:13,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are.</font>

337
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we knows the truth.</font>

338
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that like the one thing you're
not supposed to know when you're</font>

339
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:18,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">being grifted?</font>

340
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:18,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

341
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:24,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can know a plan all he wants.</font>

342
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the plan he knows won't be our plan.</font>

343
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

344
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

345
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because our plan is impossible to know?</font>

346
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:41,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, oh, my god, Jeff
is making this up as we go.</font>

347
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh, knock it off.</font>

348
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me?</font>

349
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanted you to help us do a grift.</font>

350
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm working on it.</font>

351
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:48,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Improvisationally?</font>

352
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">He definitely had in the plan in The Sting.</font>

353
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anybody wants to watch it it's
important you know it knocks out half</font>

354
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:52,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">a calendar day.</font>

355
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, do you guys remember
when we hugged and jumped up and</font>

356
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">down in the cafeteria?</font>

357
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:57,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

358
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:58,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously.</font>

359
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, having been together
virtually non-stop ever since,</font>

360
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">at what point do you think
I slipped off with pen and</font>

361
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:08,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">paper and planned an entire
grift, then withheld it from you?</font>

362
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:13,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess at any of the several dozen
points when a normal person would say,</font>

363
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the way, I have no plan.</font>

364
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">In The Sting, they do
withhold stuff from each other.</font>

365
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or from the audience,
but I think for effect.</font>

366
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, be warned, 20% of
the movie is hand drawn.</font>

367
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, why don't you marry The Sting?</font>

368
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, just so you know, if I do
and we have half Sting children,</font>

369
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they ask me how to grift, I'm
gonna tell them to watch their mother,</font>

370
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">not listen to you!</font>

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

372
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, okay!</font>

373
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:36,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, you're, you're
always picking on me, all right?</font>

374
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:37,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh.</font>

375
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've really been hammering me lately.</font>

376
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:42,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I had was the idea that,</font>

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">look, look, I, I need this.</font>

378
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be better than this guy.</font>

379
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let me think.</font>

380
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:56,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

381
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:57,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

382
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:58,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you bring your laptop?</font>

383
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, right here.</font>

384
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you wanna do with it?</font>

385
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch The Sting.</font>

386
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over.</font>

387
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:13,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.</font>

388
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:15,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who got shot?</font>

389
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

390
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was Sting even in it?</font>

391
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">That movie was terrible.</font>

392
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slept the whole time.</font>

393
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:20,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's worse.</font>

394
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:22,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dialogue seeped into my dreams.</font>

395
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">My whole brain is long and quiet.</font>

396
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how did they grift him?</font>

397
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they basically
made a fake building and</font>

398
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">hired 1,000 people to
cooperate in perfect secrecy.</font>

399
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:33,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

400
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we just do that?</font>

401
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could watch another grifter movie.</font>

402
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more activity in Matchstick Men.</font>

403
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, like what?</font>

404
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">At one point they build a fake hospital.</font>

405
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much construction!</font>

406
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:46,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, it's so late.</font>

407
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:48,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are gonna bail on me, aren't you?</font>

408
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:49,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we have to Jeff.</font>

409
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've tried everything we can.</font>

410
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe over the weekend I can make a
fake building, but all the briefcases,</font>

411
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the swapping, and The Sting?</font>

412
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:57,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not cut out for it.</font>

413
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:00,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to think that real grifts
only really happen in the movies,</font>

414
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even in the movies
they barely make sense.</font>

415
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:02,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm old.</font>

416
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:03,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Sting is terrible.</font>

417
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grifting is stupid.</font>

418
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">The writing's on the wall.</font>

419
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:09,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's it? There's
no shame in this, Jeff.</font>

420
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know about that.</font>

421
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is a scene to behold.</font>

422
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:17,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holed in the closet watching
The Sting like gypsies.</font>

423
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roger, we surrender.</font>

424
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:21,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

425
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no grifter.</font>

426
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:25,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was wrong.</font>

427
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you remember, I called you a thug.</font>

428
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:31,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thugs fight.</font>

429
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're more, nope, I can't think of a
metaphor pathetic enough to suit you,</font>

430
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:41,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff Winger, though I am reminded of
something Oscar Wilde once said when</font>

431
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">he compared sheep to wolves.</font>

432
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw it.</font>

433
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hit me with a woman's hand.</font>

434
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Midwestern floozy.</font>

435
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:55,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived in New York.</font>

436
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

437
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:16,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

438
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:18,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

439
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

440
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right, he's grifting us.</font>

441
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:27,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grift blood.</font>

442
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:28,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone taste it.</font>

443
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:30,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it's Karo Syrup and food dye.</font>

444
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean I would, but my diabetes.</font>

445
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:46,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">19, 20, 21.</font>

446
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you counting the amount of
money or the number of stacks?</font>

447
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to start over.</font>

448
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it, move.</font>

449
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:03,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I want to go on record as
being disgusted by this transaction.</font>

450
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:04,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

451
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:05,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disgusted.</font>

452
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, I'm sorry love, but would
you rather we took this to court?</font>

453
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

454
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:13,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">We appreciate you keeping this
between us and I do want to remind you</font>

455
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:16,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we offer a lot of classes
and many of them are cash only.</font>

456
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, take a class here?</font>

457
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk about a rip-off.</font>

458
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

459
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk about a ribbing.</font>

460
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell am I doing?</font>

461
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, so far, Frankie's
disgusted and, that's it.</font>

462
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like a waste of a record.</font>

463
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:33,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sorry guys.</font>

464
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all my fault.</font>

465
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:37,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be. I'm the one who
got in a pissing match.</font>

466
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:39,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a jerk.</font>

467
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a jerk.</font>

468
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:40,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a jerk.</font>

469
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:41,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a jerk.</font>

470
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all jerks.</font>

471
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this whole school can suck a big one.</font>

472
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can put that in your record.</font>

473
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, guys, I'm bound by my station.</font>

474
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:54,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking on that topic, Britta, this
is all your fault and you're expelled.</font>

475
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what? No, Dean.</font>

476
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let, let, let, let, let me handle this.</font>

477
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't do that.</font>

478
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's the heart of this group.</font>

479
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">She started it as a,
as a, as a, as a, as a,</font>

480
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:11,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a fake biology group so that
she could have sex with Troy.</font>

481
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:12,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's exactly it.</font>

482
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

483
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:14,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let me handle it.</font>

484
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You can't expel Britta,
she's been here six years.</font>

485
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three more, and she'll
have her two-year degree.</font>

486
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta keeps me grounded in reality.</font>

487
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't expel her with four
week-isodes left in the seaso-mester.</font>

488
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:24,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, it's starting.</font>

489
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, guys.</font>

490
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

491
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

492
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">50,000.</font>

493
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoop, I'll just put this in here.</font>

494
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:34,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

495
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

496
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

497
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't help me, anyone.</font>

498
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:40,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn me around.</font>

499
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later.</font>

500
00:20:53,652 --> 00:21:02,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

501
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:04,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plan was to meet later.</font>

502
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:08,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's it gonna
cost to make you go away?</font>

503
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:11,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're know there's a way we
could end this very quickly and</font>

504
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:12,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">make a bit of money.</font>

505
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like it, but keep talking.</font>

506
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. That was the plan.</font>

507
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, your plan was
probably to never show up.</font>

508
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:20,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clever girl.</font>

509
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't trust anyone.</font>

510
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, ooh.</font>

511
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:36,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on Did you have to hit me, for real?</font>

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have to?</font>

513
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:37,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

514
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:43,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that you're expelled, you
might consider a career in grifting.</font>

515
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're quite good at it.</font>

516
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. How does one
go through life like that?</font>

517
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:52,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, follow me, and I'll show you.</font>

518
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:53,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shut up.</font>

519
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:02,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only agreed to any of this to
get you away from Greendale and</font>

520
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of Jeff's hair.</font>

521
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:07,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an idiot, but I hate watching
him spin out trying to beat you.</font>

522
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sentimental fool.</font>

523
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:12,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later at the motel.</font>

524
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">The motel.</font>

525
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:16,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

526
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:19,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say I'm a lucky grifter.</font>

527
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say I'm the king.</font>

528
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:27,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call me the lucky grifter.</font>

529
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:30,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call me the King of England.</font>

530
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the king.</font>

531
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:37,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

532
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:43,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

533
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:47,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shut up.</font>

534
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only reason I agreed to any
of this was to get you away from</font>

535
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale and out of Jeff's hair.</font>

536
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:59,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the?</font>

537
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:05,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two, come back here!</font>

538
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:06,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Briefcases.</font>

539
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:07,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming right through.</font>

540
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:09,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Identical briefcases.</font>

541
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

542
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why more briefcases?</font>

543
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:15,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is pointless!</font>

544
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already know she's got my briefcase!</font>

545
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Briefcase parade!</font>

546
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:24,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

547
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:28,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get back here.</font>

548
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:30,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get back here with my money.</font>

549
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back here!</font>

550
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Roger.</font>

551
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stole my money.</font>

552
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

553
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:52,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

554
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:53,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those briefcases contain my money.</font>

555
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stole $50,000 from me.</font>

556
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">50 grand, huh?</font>

557
00:23:57,993 --> 00:23:59,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys know what he's talking about?</font>

558
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:00,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.</font>

559
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:03,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are our briefcases.</font>

560
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:04,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is grifting class.</font>

561
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:05,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sells these supplies.</font>

562
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:05,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">150 bucks.</font>

563
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

564
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

565
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:07,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

566
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:08,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are still rolling.</font>

567
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:10,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got pretty good at it, too.</font>

568
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out.</font>

569
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:12,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

570
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, sorry. Sorry.</font>

571
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:16,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

572
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:20,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Roger, why were you
walking around with $50,000?</font>

573
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:22,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you mental?</font>

574
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, whoa pal.</font>

575
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:26,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">That usage may fly in
the UK, not in the States.</font>

576
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a mentally challenged cousin.</font>

577
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:31,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sister.</font>

578
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:31,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pics.</font>

579
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna see pics.</font>

580
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you do. You know
very well that this school</font>

581
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:40,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">paid me $50,000 in cash for these injuries.</font>

582
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you seem to be in pretty good shape.</font>

583
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, oh, my god!</font>

584
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the two of you!</font>

585
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:46,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's the reason I became a cop.</font>

586
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a lot of bullies out there.</font>

587
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:52,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a million witnesses to this.</font>

588
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everyone.</font>

589
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:55,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys, just hanging
out in the cafeteria?</font>

590
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi profess... oh, what
happened to your face?</font>

591
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous.</font>

592
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:00,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw. She's beautiful.</font>

593
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:02,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could be twins.</font>

594
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:06,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the statement I'm hearing here
is you're a grifting professor.</font>

595
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You're teaching these
people how to grift but</font>

596
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:11,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're saying they grifted you.</font>

597
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:12,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you id.</font>

598
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not saying that.</font>

599
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't grift me.</font>

600
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:17,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they do is not grifting.</font>

601
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wouldn't even understand
what the word meant.</font>

602
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:25,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need to take what
Roger's saying more seriously.</font>

603
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:25,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

604
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:31,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it sounds like he was either
the victim of crass, artless thuggery.</font>

605
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:32,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.</font>

606
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:37,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">In which case, there really is
$50,000 floating around that he was</font>

607
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:42,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">given for clearly fake injuries, and
that he therefore now owes the school.</font>

608
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:43,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

609
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:48,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Professor DeSalvo was targeted
by a group of people he vastly</font>

610
