<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! - Hey!
- No! No, no, no!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Our friend use
to sit there.</font>

69
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:46,360

about here?</font>

71
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:51,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I guess that's okay.
- That's cool.</font>

72
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so,</font>

73
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:58,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took an informal survey to get
a sense of how Greendale is perceived.</font>

74
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And three themes emerged;</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird, passionate
and gross.</font>

76
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you want to hang
onto that grouping.</font>

77
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:09,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">In marketing, it's what
we call the Good Belushi.</font>

78
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had a magic wand,</font>

79
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would use it to make sure
Greendale never had to grow up.</font>

80
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would also probably use it
to cut the Magic Wand class</font>

81
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I noticed is
actually offered here,</font>

82
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:22,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">as well as VCR Repair,
a class called Ladders,</font>

83
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:25,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">and When is it Okay
to Shake a Baby?</font>

84
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">In terms of hierarchy, I'm
a big believer in it.</font>

85
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:31,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone needs to say, I'm in
charge, and that person is me.</font>

86
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:32,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my decision.</font>

87
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean that
we don't work together,</font>

88
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">but all communication
and decisions will go through me.</font>

89
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:42,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll send out an email later
to set up our next meeting.</font>

90
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Awesome. - Okay.
- Great seeing you, Professor.</font>

91
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Coolios.</font>

92
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who in the crazy bitch?
- Did that just happen?</font>

93
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see her binder?</font>

94
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pretty nondescript.
- Seems like she may be trouble.</font>

95
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:57,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be fair, she's an additional
white person,</font>

96
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">which has clearly
become important here.</font>

97
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

98
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I'm just glad I was
able to answer.</font>

99
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">My-My phone got
lodged in my pocket.</font>

100
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know!</font>

101
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that is a thing.</font>

102
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you were saying
about the thing,</font>

103
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:14,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">the reason you were calling was,
what were you talking to me about?</font>

104
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks good, Tony.</font>

105
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I just assume
your name is Tony.</font>

106
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:21,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

107
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you some
extra heat.</font>

108
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:30,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, what is the weekly
cost of this restaurant?</font>

109
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's easy.
My dignity.</font>

110
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like this sandwich counter
is consuming your happiness</font>

111
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">and converting it into
burnt bread and debt.</font>

112
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:41,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

113
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, hi.</font>

114
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

115
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone removed all the liquor

118
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't teach with
free flowing sobriety.</font>

119
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that true?</font>

120
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
you're an addict?</font>

121
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

122
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean!</font>

123
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,028

124
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:11,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I can talk.
- Damn it.</font>

125
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am available
anytime for you.</font>

126
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie, Frankie.</font>

127
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. I had an idea about how
to deelectrify the pool.</font>

128
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's already
been dealt with.</font>

129
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, well, then, there's—
- Oh, let's see.</font>

130
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:26,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done, done, deloused.</font>

135
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is pretty.</font>

136
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:40,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

137
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna name one of my
sandwiches after her.</font>

138

139
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is improving
Greendale.</font>

140
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:50,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but how much can
you improve Greendale</font>

141
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">before it stops
being Greendale?</font>

142
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't suffer
for this place.</font>

143
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't understand it.</font>

144

00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:15,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">in 12 hours these
dinosaurs will become—</font>

149
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:19,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mind if I sit here?
- Time-asaurs.</font>

150
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, I can reshoot.</font>

151
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's everything going?</font>

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have concerns.
- I'd like to hear them.</font>

153
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:29,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm worried you're not
distinct enough from Annie,</font>

154
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">both in terms of
physicality and purpose.</font>

155
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

156
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't determine if you
have any specific flaw,</font>

157
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:38,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">quirk, or point of view that makes you
a creative addition to the group.</font>

158
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that means,
but I'm writing it down.</font>

159
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">My umbrella concern is
that you, as a character,</font>

160
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">represent the end of what
I used to call our show,</font>

161
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">which was once an unlikely
family of misfit students,</font>

162
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">and is now a pretty loose knit
group of students and teachers.</font>

163
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of whom are taking a class together
in a school which, as of your arrival,</font>

164
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">is becoming increasingly
grounded, asking questions like,</font>

165
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">how do any of us
get our money?</font>

166
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will we get our degrees, and what
happened to that girl I was dating?</font>

167
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">As opposed to questions I consider
more important like, what is real?</font>

168
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is sanity? Is there a god?
Where's that Pierce hologram?</font>

169
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff said last year he
saw a Pierce hologram.</font>

170
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of the rest of us have ever seen it.
So, if there's a Pierce ghost on campus,</font>

171
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to get a head
start on busting it.</font>

172
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

173
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first I've heard
that I'm a character on a show.</font>

174
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm excited to be one, but
I agree, I'll be a boring one.</font>

175
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:19,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quirks are not my strong
suit, results are.</font>

176
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:20,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love quirky people.</font>

177
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:24,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come from a big family of
people who are literally insane.</font>

178
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I moved down here to take
care of one of them.</font>

179
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I myself am
exceptionally boring,</font>

180
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:30,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am quite proud
to be that way,</font>

181
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:35,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it allows me to help the less
boring people turn quirks into results.</font>

182
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the most interesting take on not
being interesting that I've ever heard.</font>

183
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:41,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as what I represent
about your show,</font>

184
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't give me or anyone
else that kind of power.</font>

185
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:46,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good shows change,
I assume.</font>

186
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personally,
I don't own a TV.</font>

187
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the first person to say that that
I didn't immediately delete from my brain.</font>

188
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

189
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emergency meeting
at Shirley's Sandwiches right now.</font>

190
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:00,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone freaking out.
New lady is evil.</font>

191
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:01,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy frown.</font>

192
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:04,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go.</font>

193
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I could really use someone's help
in learning the ropes around here.</font>

194
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:10,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ask around.</font>

195
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends, dumb hats.</font>

196
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:17,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Totally talking down to you.
- She hates you.</font>

197
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it from Jared.</font>

198
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you guys doing back here?
Are you the big chilling? - Yeah,</font>

199
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:24,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">only there's not a hippie that died
to make us come together and complain.</font>

200
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's our school.
- Frankie's taking over the campus.</font>

201
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:28,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">She cancelled Ladders,
she's banning substances,</font>

202
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">she wants to shut down
Shirley's sandwiches.</font>

203
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She called Annie a bitch.
- She implied I was a bitch.</font>

204
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:36,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">She implied Annie was a stuck up bitch
who thinks she's better than everyone.</font>

205
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, now you're just—
- She was nice to me.</font>

206
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:39,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact we kinda
got along.</font>

207
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are you sure she wasn't
actually being sweetly condescending?</font>

208
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, I learned to pick
up on that one.</font>

209
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make a movement that we form
a separate, secret, committee.</font>

210
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I second Britta's motion,
not movement.</font>

211
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:56,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I third Annie's number two-ing
of the movement Britta made.</font>

212
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:58,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gross. - Our mission
to preserve the real Greendale.</font>

213
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:01,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oppose Frankie or drink.</font>

214
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever's easiest.</font>

215
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys
sure she's bad?</font>

216
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you're not doing what
I usually do, overreacting to change?</font>

217
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's ever doing what you
usually do Abed. You're nuts.</font>

218
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:11,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

219
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a good way.
I'm just saying.</font>

220
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leave reality to us.
- We always support you.</font>

221
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make it more
dramatic than it is.</font>

222
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a blood oath to defy evil.
You're either in or you're out.</font>

223
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:22,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I hang around if
I don't do the oath.</font>

224
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gee. You mean
just be friends?</font>

225
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. Great, Abed.</font>

226
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:29,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

227
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have some pretzels?</font>

228
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

229
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are secret
committee pretzels.</font>

230
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:43,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

231
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well.</font>

232
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that was a test.</font>

233
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are bad friends.</font>

234
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think of it
as bad baking.</font>

235
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of it as a crushing
blow to a gender stereotype.</font>

236
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, it might help
if every burnt sandwich</font>

237
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:12,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't come with a self-aware
burnt sandwich bit.</font>

238
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you're gonna help
increase sales, creative notes?</font>

239
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had that sign
spinner idea.</font>

240
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:24,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a restaurant inside a cafeteria
Annie, our weak point wasn't traffic.</font>

241
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:28,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flo, Alice, stop fighting, can't
afford to lose this place.</font>

242
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I have to start drinking
in the men's room,</font>

to change from Trent Reznor</font>

244
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Johnny Cash doing
Trent Reznor.</font>

245
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:37,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bartender Annie, I know a little bit
more about the human side of service.</font>

246
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't eat this.
Can I have my money back?</font>

247
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're human garbage.</font>

248
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mr. Winger.
Nice lecture yesterday.</font>

249
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't patronize me Dave.</font>

250
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:50,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might not seem like this, but you're
killing small, black owned business.</font>

251
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:54,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call it even for
a drink with Mr. Winger.</font>

252
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's absurd.
- You will?</font>

253
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see some ID.
You snitch, you die.</font>

254
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:06,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Morning.
- Morning.</font>

255
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning.</font>

256
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I guess we'll wait for
the others before we start.</font>

257
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:11,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
they're coming.</font>

258
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? The committee had a meeting
last night and decided you are evil.</font>

259
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Wait, you guys had
a meeting last night?</font>

260
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we broke
up as friends.</font>

261
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't
think you're evil.</font>

262
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you scare people, because you live
in the real world instead of up your butt.</font>

263
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry that
happened, Abed.</font>

264
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I said
yesterday at lunch.</font>

265
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:32,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drama and conflict are
exciting and easy.</font>

266
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:34,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making a difference
can be pretty boring.</font>

267
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys had lunch?</font>

268
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to try to live
in that world.</font>

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little tired from all the drama,
the heroes, the villains, monsters.</font>

be like that but</font>

273
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,990

sense to be against it.</font>

of The Slender Man?</font>

- Cuz it's awesome.</font>

we were more like you, so</font>

280
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,433

285
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- Yeah?</font>

286
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:28,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?</font>

287

pretty similar visually.</font>

290
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:38,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't picture a montage cutting
from me verifying Diane's invoice</font>

291
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:40,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">to me emailing
confirmation to Diane.</font>

292
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. But a montage
is what, Abed?</font>

293
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a movie apologizing
for reality.</font>

294
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are where?</font>

295
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:47,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Reality.
- And what do people do here?</font>

296
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">They email Diane?</font>

297
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:08,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, if you change your clothes
one more time today, you're fired.</font>

298
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

299
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Abed.
Hey, Todd.</font>

300
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are Annie and Britta around?
- No.</font>

301
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed,</font>

302
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe you should
order the special.</font>

303
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:36,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have the special.</font>

304
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">The specials are
kept in the back.</font>

305
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should, you should
go in the back.</font>

306
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like the special.</font>

307
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaporizers, Skittles?</font>

308
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- Hey, Annie.</font>

309
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:39,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This place is so conceptual.
- It's practical, too.</font>

310
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">We made enough money
to save Shirley's.</font>

311
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in an ironic way, because if
Shirley saw this, her soul would die.</font>

312
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed, check this out.</font>

313
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Britta's still the worst?
- Yeah.</font>

314
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bar gets dirty.</font>

315
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna need someone to clean
it, probably after hours,</font>

316
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:58,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those floor polishers
can get pretty loud.</font>

317
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd hate for someone
to hear it.</font>

318
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You blackmailing me?</font>

319
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just talking shop.</font>

320
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:08,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the rumpus, Abed?
- Miller's Crossing.</font>

321
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

322
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really great. You guys
should be proud of yourselves.</font>

323
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We missed you.
Have a drink.</font>

324
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put on an old
timey jacket.</font>

325
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay, I don't
really do this anymore.</font>

326
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:19,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, come on.</font>

327
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:21,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said I don't
do this, see.</font>

328
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:25,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You dirty rat.
- Guys are all dirty rats.</font>

329
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your romper room?</font>

330
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, maybe
just one drink.</font>

331
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then maybe cut
to a montage of drinks.</font>

332
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink up!</font>

333
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's never stop being
friends again ever. - Mm-hm.</font>

334
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers!</font>

335
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:49,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't have made you
choose between Frankie and us.</font>

336
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she's good
for business.</font>

337
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:53,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry that we made
you choose between—</font>

338
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:56,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're just repeating what I said.
- No, you're repeating what I said.</font>

339
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm a time traveler?</font>

340
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the show.</font>

341
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed,</font>

342
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:11,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got word from Diane that one
of your emails was a little shaky.</font>

343
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

344
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:14,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good. Late
night last night.</font>

345
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

346
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I could use
a little protein.</font>

347
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:20,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get
an early lunch.</font>

348
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys know about
tardigrades?</font>

349
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're these microscopic creatures
that look like robot bears.</font>

350
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They can survive in space.
- Mm. - Mm-hm.</font>

351
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:33,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get into space, you
dirty tardigrades, see?</font>

352
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're everywhere.</font>

353
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:39,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of little things in real
life that are just as cool as fake stuff.</font>

354
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned that
working for Frankie.</font>

355
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys would like
her, you know.</font>

356
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Raid!</font>

357
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what
you guys want?</font>

358
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna play cops
and robbers with costumes?</font>

359
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that guy a carrot?</font>

360
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because they ran out.
- Who tattled?</font>

361
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">In what world, Britta, do you see this
as covert enough to require tattling?</font>

362
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">You built a bar
in a school.</font>

363
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was lumber involved.</font>

364
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been letting you
hole up down here,</font>

365
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it kept you
contained and satisfied,</font>

366
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you are all
compulsively defiant,</font>

367
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it wasn't enough.</font>

368
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:21,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had to drag Abed back in,
and Abed deserves better.</font>

369
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:25,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. - Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho,
it finally comes out.</font>

370
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed deserves better.</font>

371
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's been out.
- Shut up, Leonard.</font>

372
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:33,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once mistook six people
for you at a pharmacy.</font>

373
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not their fault, Frankie.
I chose this.</font>

374
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my friends.</font>

375
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:39,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate emailing Diane.</font>

376
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:42,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't commit to a font.
It's pathological, and so am I.</font>

377
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where I belong.</font>

378
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you think that, Abed,
but you don't know any better.</font>

379
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:52,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font>

380
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">But—</font>

381
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">shut up, Leonard.</font>

382
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

383
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are old.</font>

384
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you deserve less,
because of your age.</font>

385
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't, I don't
actually believe that.</font>

386
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to,
I'm trying to, and</font>

387
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:11,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">everybody here is a,
is a fart a livid fart</font>

388
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:14,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the butt of
a lesser god.</font>

389
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm, I'm better than this.</font>

390
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut to everyone on campus getting
as drunk as they want montage.</font>

391
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankie hasn't come
back to work today.</font>

392
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's terrible.</font>

393
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">The insurance
company dropped us.</font>

394
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:48,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The school has no insurance.
- What was Frankie's salary?</font>

395
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A lot. - What were
the insurance premiums?</font>

396
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:53,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A lot. - Add those two numbers together,
that's your new school dance budget.</font>

397
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice.</font>

398
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Ladders!</font>

399
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

400
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladder!</font>

401
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to see the ladders
professor go higher?</font>

402
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:26,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladder!</font>

403
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

404
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it, Jeff Winger!</font>

405
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your school now.</font>

406
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie.
- It was worth it.</font>

407
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:43,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

408
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:55,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that should be the extent
of the professor's medical bills.</font>

409
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What-What about that
lawsuits from the students?</font>

410
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we should
fight those.</font>

411
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I suggest you
settle out of court.</font>

412
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:02,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is my fault.
- Obviously not.</font>

413
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:03,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.</font>

414
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, it's my fault.
- It's my fault.</font>

415
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.</font>

416
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.</font>

417
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my fault.
- It's my fault.</font>

418
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:16,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fault. It's my fault.
It's my fault. It's my fault.</font>

419
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all
right, all right.</font>

420
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, whose fault wasn't it?</font>

421
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who knows anything about
handling anything like this?</font>

422
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">In terms of hierarchy, I'm
a big believer in it.</font>

423
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:30,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone needs to say, I'm in
charge, and that person is me.</font>

424
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my decision.</font>

425
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

426
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry?
- Who talks like that?</font>

427
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone hire
someone so pompous?</font>

428
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:41,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Dart, word of advice,
change your personality,</font>

429
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">or start looking for companies
run by insane people.</font>

430
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:47,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't hire this woman.
- Fifth time's the charm.</font>

431
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:49,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's barged the four offices
screaming, don't hire this woman.</font>

432
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:52,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing here?</font>

433
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did you even find me?
- I emailed Diane.</font>

434
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows way too much about
your schedule, by the way.</font>

435
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever he's offering you,
Greendale, well, we can't double it.</font>

436
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:02,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">We probably can't
even match it.</font>

437
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:07,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever he's offering you, Greendale
will give you less, and an apology.</font>

438
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know—
- Shh.</font>

439
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not enough,</font>

440
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:19,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">but maybe if you added
more apologies.</font>

441
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a montage of them?</font>

442
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry.</font>

443
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I wouldn't be
needing dinner tonight.</font>

444
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing you wouldn't.</font>

445
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if you're
looking for this.</font>

446
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:23,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you know?</font>

447
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:26,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody makes more
crumbs than a cook.</font>

448
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the same goes for
clues and detectives.</font>

449
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:31,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too busy solving murders
to get away with your own.</font>

450
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, what about the case
of my wife and my legs, Shirley?</font>

451
00:25:34,796 --> 00:25:36,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you solve that one, huh?
Can you?</font>

452
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cuz if you can't, then I ain't
got nothing to live for.</font>

453
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:41,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begging your pardon,
Mr. Butcher.</font>

454
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:44,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the people on this
bayou would disagree.</font>

455
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You rescued a runaway girl today.
- Rescued, balls.</font>

456
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:50,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't even rescue
a, a bulb from a socket.</font>

457
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:52,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you did all the work
today, didn't you?</font>

458
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:56,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a detective from the swamps
of Atlanta, can't even walk.</font>

459
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Aah!</font>

460
00:25:58,236 --> 00:26:00,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let me be your legs.</font>

461
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:04,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me do for you what I did today
every week until you find your wife.</font>

462
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:04,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or your legs.</font>

463
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:09,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a stubborn son of
a bitch, Shirley Bennett.</font>

464
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now come on.
I have dinner to make.</font>

465
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:13,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got cases to solve.</font>

466
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:23,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feeling someone's gonna murder
some tater tots tonight.</font>

467
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's no mystery at all.</font>

468
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:40,079
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Next week, on The
Butcher and The Baker,</i></font>

469
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:41,984
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>when a new detective on
the Bayou disappears,</i></font>

470
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:45,584
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and Butcher is the prime suspect, it's up
to Shirley to cook up some answers.</i></font>
