17
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:46,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just kept auditioning,
you know, kept working hard.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">In the new Play Dough movie, is that right?</font>

24
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:01,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe, you know, maybe.</font>

25
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:06,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">But like I always say, you
know, life is a roller coaster.</font>

26
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:09,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a teacher at a
community college in Colorado.</font>

- One day in class say,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">class dismissed, I'm headed to Hollywood?</font>

30
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:13,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean.</font>

00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did your students react to that?</font>

32
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:18,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know, I haven't
spoken to them, really.</font>

of you now, are they?</font>

40
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they are not.</font>

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there it is, ladies and gentlemen,</font>

45
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:47,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">from community college to
something a little bit better.</font>

ship to eternal validation.</font>

48
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn it off.</font>

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank's so much for being.</font>

50
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well it's been three weeks.</font>

51
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:00,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm having his car towed.</font>

52
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:35,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Chang.</font>

00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">May your success be brief,
and your colds last months.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, get out of Greendale,
or you get me in your corner,</font>

56
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">you don't get both.</font>

57
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:42,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ham, girl.</font>

58
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:45,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would have predicted
Chang becoming famous?</font>

59
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically, I did, remember?</font>

60
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only, I thought it would be for...</font>

61
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:50,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eating someone, yeah.</font>

62
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:52,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that Spielberg
stuff is really happening?</font>

63
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:54,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could that happen?</font>

64
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:56,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would mean the world was insane.</font>

65
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haaaaaaaaa'aaam, gurrrrl!</font>

66
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:04,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to be crass, but there is
an upside to this, financially.</font>

67
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:07,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang's absence lowers
our insurance premiums 6%.</font>

68
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing but upsides to him leaving.</font>

69
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we all just feel
a little short changed.</font>

70
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We invested so much in
him when no one else would.</font>

71
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:19,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we all assumed he was so insane
he would die if we kicked him out.</font>

72
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:22,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole time it turns
out we were holding him back.</font>

73
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought he was bedrock.</font>

74
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:28,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it turns out he was the
ceiling of a cavern filled with us.</font>

75
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:30,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have already forgotten his name.</font>

76
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:32,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever really know his name?</font>

77
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Chinese fellow, right?</font>

78
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose name was some kind of noise?</font>

79
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:37,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clang, bang, merengue.</font>

80
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like I'm the only one
who's not glad he's gone.</font>

81
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:42,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least I can finally clear
some space in my hard drive.</font>

82
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Leonard's been in
there for a while, but</font>

83
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can stand guard if you
wanna use the women's room.</font>

84
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean, I was shooting a movie
with Chang before he booked Ham Girl.</font>

85
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

86
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:54,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't heard from him since,
so I assume the footage is useless.</font>

87
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he sign a release form?</font>

88
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:57,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

89
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make all my actors sign
releases before we do anything.</font>

90
00:03:58,837 --> 00:03:59,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know who is going to.</font>

91
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:04,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">The school owns a movie
starring the Ham Girl guy.</font>

92
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon to be Spielberg's Ham Girl guy.</font>

93
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:10,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. There's no way to finish it, though.</font>

94
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

95
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have I told you about quitting?</font>

96
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:13,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it's sometimes
the only way to survive.</font>

97
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:17,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't forget I said sometimes.</font>

98
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yolanda, the mayor's up my ass.</font>

99
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:23,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want justice.</font>

100
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him in here!</font>

101
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right?</font>

102
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:29,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I be angry?</font>

103
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">The film's hero is police justice.</font>

104
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a real life former cop
help me with the dialogue.</font>

105
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna punch you in the heart.</font>

106
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:36,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real life former cops
aren't great with dialogue.</font>

107
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think police should be heroes.</font>

108
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, pay your rent.</font>

109
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Abed. Okay, I need more information.</font>

110
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my motivation?</font>

111
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:44,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I married?</font>

112
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:45,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more to go on.</font>

113
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get lunch?</font>

114
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:47,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cut.</font>

115
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:48,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's about all we got.</font>

116
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang found out the McRib was back
and we lost the rest of the day.</font>

117
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great actor, huge McRib problem.</font>

118
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

119
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:54,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody.</font>

120
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:58,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my friend I told you about, Maury.</font>

121
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:01,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a genuine Hollywood film producer
whose doctor ordered him to live in</font>

122
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:03,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colorado due to a medical condition.</font>

123
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:04,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them what you told me.</font>

124
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, my blood nitrogen
levels are through the roof.</font>

125
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Most of the time, I can't...
- Oh, no, no the other thing.</font>

126
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:11,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right. If you can cut together
an 81 minute movie that arguably stars</font>

127
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Ham Girl guy, I can guarantee
distribution and a fast turnaround deal.</font>

128
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">People do it all the time with old
footage from recently famous actors.</font>

129
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:22,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen Vin Diesel
in 1996's Happy Pants?</font>

130
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

131
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, neither has Vin Diesel, but</font>

132
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">his roommate from film
school saw 500 grand.</font>

133
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,393

134
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:33,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my only chance at the mainstream
success I need before I'm allowed to</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">make weird stuff for money.</font>

136

Elephant Man, my Four Rooms,</font>

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Robert Rodriguez segment.</font>

138
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:39,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why does it have
to be a police movie?</font>

139
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't even like police now.</font>

140
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:43,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">They like dinosaurs, they like aliens and</font>

141
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:45,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything else that Chris
Pratt can join forces with.</font>

142
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. I have three minutes of footage and</font>

143
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's clearly a police chief
behind a desk in New York.</font>

144
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he? Or is it Space York,
or is it a dinosaur desk?</font>

145
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:52,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know?</font>

146
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:53,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just add some CG.</font>

147
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what they do with Chris Pratt.</font>

148
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">They put in him a regular scene,
and then they add some Gagoos.</font>

mouthwash commercial, but</font>

151
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I successfully won back the
rights to my gingivitis monster.</font>

152
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:11,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I don't know if it helps, but,
when I moved into my RV, I found this.</font>

153
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that, you notice anything strange?</font>

154
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:17,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no green three in billiards.</font>

155
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, there's a green six and a green
fourteen, but never a green three.</font>

156
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:26,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what sport is this from?</font>

157
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:26,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why was it in my RV?</font>

158
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway I... I can do some CG for the movie.</font>

159
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need a Chris Pratt type.</font>

160
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:35,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it if I have to.</font>

161
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can slouch.</font>

162
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you guys are
the ones pitching me this,</font>

163
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't believe I'm saying no.</font>

164
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not saying no.</font>

165
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, legally, I can't force you.</font>

166
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, I can do a morning announcement
that will make everyone hate you forever.</font>

167
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:49,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically, Abed, you would
be robbing the school for</font>

168
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">half a million dollars
by not making this movie.</font>

169
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, what movie?</font>

170
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you not been listening?</font>

171
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">The movie about the Ham Girl guy, in
his space office fighting some Gagoos,</font>

172
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:01,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">led by Chris Pratt type, played
by Jeffrey without his shirt.</font>

173
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

174
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shoots this weekend.</font>

175
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah?</font>

176
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:07,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but I get final cut,
and it has to be a good movie.</font>

177
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:10,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed, but you have to finish that
cut by Monday, even if it's bad.</font>

178
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree to that, but it has
to be good by my standards.</font>

179
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, and also, if it's
terrible, nobody will notice or care.</font>

180
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:16,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are all gonna help me?</font>

181
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're gonna make a good movie?</font>

182
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely, or a bad one.</font>

183
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably a bad one.</font>

184
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're all on the same page.</font>

185
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:22,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

186
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess so.</font>

187
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:24,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

188
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's crap out this piece of crap.</font>

189
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">That attitude concerns me.</font>

190
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more information.</font>

191
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my motivation?</font>

192
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more to go on.</font>

193
00:07:57,346 --> 00:08:01,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Chief Star,
and I am in the stars.</font>

194
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I am the hero.</font>

195
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserve better.</font>

196
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a very gifted pilot, Chief Star.</font>

197
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the mayor of outer space.</font>

198
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we changing course?</font>

199
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mayor is up my ass.</font>

200
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, I love him.</font>

201
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the space?</font>

202
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba dooba dooba.</font>

203
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're under attack.</font>

204
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">By whom, Glip Glop?</font>

205
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cut.</font>

206
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we cutting?</font>

207
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:31,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">That felt good to me.</font>

208
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:32,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Moving on?
- Stop.</font>

209
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:33,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a couple of adjustments.</font>

210
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, you get two.</font>

211
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys need to move
when the ship gets hit.</font>

212
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks weird when you stand still.</font>

213
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Britta, it sounds weird
when you use good grammar.</font>

214
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">My character can't have good grammar?</font>

215
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in a space battle.</font>

216
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because everything else we're
saying sounds really natural, like,</font>

217
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Space Senator.</font>

218
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:47,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Space Mayor.</font>

219
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm matching your dialogue
to what I have from Chang.</font>

220
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are my lines?
- You don't have any lines.</font>

221
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:51,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the back of Chang.</font>

222
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have Chang's footage.</font>

223
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">This shot from that angle
matches the back of Chang's shot.</font>

224
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang is Chief Star.</font>

225
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:56,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the pilot of the spaceship.</font>

226
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're Princess Meridian.</font>

227
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brittana.</font>

228
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:00,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Jeff is her father,
the Mayor of Space, and</font>

229
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">you guys are under attack.</font>

230
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:02,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Action!</font>

231
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:05,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the space?</font>

232
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba dooba dooba.</font>

233
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're under attack.</font>

234
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cut.</font>

235
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you guys seeing Glip Glop?</font>

236
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Glip Glop was a tennis ball.</font>

237
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Garrett's not Glip Glop.</font>

238
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I was Glip Glop, why would I be
holding a tennis ball on a stick?</font>

239
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I wearing a blouse?</font>

240
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Sci-fi, it doesn't matter.</font>

241
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't say that.</font>

242
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you don't mean that.</font>

243
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tennis ball is Glip Glop, and
please stumble in the same direction.</font>

244
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:27,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Action.</font>

245
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bang.</font>

246
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in space?</font>

247
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gooba, gooba, gooba.</font>

248
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're under attack!</font>

249
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:39,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who by? Who attack? Me princess.
- The Sporborfians!</font>

250
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm ready.</font>

251
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready?</font>

252
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rolling.</font>

253
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:53,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we rolling?</font>

254
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:57,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're</font>

255
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:05,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">rolling!</font>

256
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to the escape pod.</font>

257
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? You picked that outfit?</font>

258
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:09,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?</font>

259
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:10,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Meridian.</font>

260
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:12,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep going.
- Insane.</font>

261
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, what is your name, Exploitia?</font>

262
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:18,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scorpio Nine, I'm a pleasure droid.</font>

263
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm an assassin?</font>

264
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:21,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're both, keep going.</font>

265
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:22,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a pleasure droid.</font>

266
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:23,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got turned into an assassin.</font>

267
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's my other daughter.</font>

268
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your sister.</font>

269
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:28,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to the escape pods.</font>

270
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, then we go.</font>

271
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

272
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check on Chief Star, Jeff.</font>

273
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chief Star?</font>

274
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

275
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you in hell.</font>

276
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

277
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mayor, your ass is grass.</font>

278
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cut.</font>

279
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:51,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are some things that we could...</font>

280
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:55,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Moving on, people.</font>

281
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, moving on.</font>

282
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next shot, space station faculty lounge.</font>

283
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

284
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we need to move
a little faster I think.</font>

285
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I just explain
something as a filmmaker?</font>

286
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you wouldn't.</font>

287
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you would look at
what I was wearing, and</font>

288
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">let that be all the explanation you need</font>

289
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">about where are standards should be.</font>

290
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, do you understand that sci-fi
films aren't usually improvised</font>

291
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">over a weekend with a cast
and crew that doesn't care?</font>

292
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">We care about finishing.</font>

293
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, this has to be finished by Monday.</font>

294
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you're back into a
level of quality from there.</font>

295
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me use a metaphor I can understand.</font>

296
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, I work out.</font>

297
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Yes, because I'm not an artist like you, but</font>

298
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:32,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is a kind of canvas.</font>

299
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I work on it with equipment,
but I will never really be done.</font>

300
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You could be if you wanted, I mean...
- This will never be done.</font>

301
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris Pratt's never gonna stop, is he?</font>

302
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll always be out there mocking me.</font>

303
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I can never stop.</font>

304
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like you'll never stop making movies.</font>

305
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, I don't stay on one
treadmill my entire life,</font>

306
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">staring at commercials for
movies with Chris Pratt.</font>

307
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take my work into the world.</font>

308
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I premiere it, I share with the public.</font>

309
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't stay in the gym, Abed.</font>

310
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get this session done, get out
there and get your shirt off.</font>

311
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:03,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it?</font>

312
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

313
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

314
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready, let's do this.</font>

315
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:25,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you</font>

316
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:30,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">are looking for</font>

317
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:35,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">your friends.</font>

318
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:36,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

319
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Minotaur Man.</font>

320
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

321
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:42,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends are hard to come by in space.</font>

322
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:49,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd better take this for protection.</font>

323
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:56,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sound you hear coming from the gun I gave
you is 40,000 hyper watts of laser.</font>

324
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't worry, don't worry about that.</font>

325
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can put that back.</font>

326
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes my eye falls off
because I mean, I'm a robot.</font>

327
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- Watch out!</font>

328
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

329
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:23,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about this bar, everyone
here is so accustomed to violence.</font>

330
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need, any no...</font>

331
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where your friends are?</font>

332
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:27,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

333
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but you're not gonna like this.</font>

334
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friends have been taken
prisoner by Master, Master Dracula.</font>

335
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wild West baby.</font>

336
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Space version of the Wild West.</font>

337
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut.</font>

338
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

339
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">My eye fell off, but,
but, but I, I covered it.</font>

340
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

341
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving on, hallway.</font>

342
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:11,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

343
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

344
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that!</font>

345
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is crazy.</font>

346
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

347
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me do this.</font>

348
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

349
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:31,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make everything harder
for all women when you do that.</font>

350
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm improvising.</font>

351
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Improvise pockets.</font>

352
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:36,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pay your rent, or shut up.</font>

353
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Laser bomb!</font>

354
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:57,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba Dooba dooba, Glip Glop like.</font>

355
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba Dooba dooba, Yooba
Dooba dooba, Yooba Dooba dooba.</font>

356
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:07,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the robot also says yooba dooba.</font>

357
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:08,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not complaining.</font>

358
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that everyone who's not
a person is saying "Yooba Dooba.".</font>

359
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's because I'm a spy.</font>

360
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

361
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a spy.</font>

362
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an evil spy.</font>

363
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot Glip Glop's he's a spy.</font>

364
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:23,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glop Glop's a spy?</font>

365
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">We went with it.</font>

366
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:28,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay shot.</font>

367
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:28,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shot.</font>

368
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay now that now that he's dead and</font>

369
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's one robot left
let's go to the thing.</font>

370
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

371
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba Dooba dooba, Yooba
Dooba dooba, Yooba Dooba dooba.</font>

372
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

373
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:53,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Space garbage.</font>

374
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

375
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

376
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! We're gonna get crushed.</font>

377
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">And is there a monster?</font>

378
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

379
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:05,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">But so what?</font>

380
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get crushed.</font>

381
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you?</font>

382
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you.
- That's your daughter.</font>

383
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're my daughter.
- Yeah and you said we were sisters, dumb ass.</font>

384
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hot. It's like Chinatown in space.</font>

385
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:23,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

386
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

387
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:26,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I'm the hero?
- Yay!</font>

388
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:29,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do this.
- Yeah!</font>

389
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're saved!</font>

390
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel the force.</font>

391
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

392
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't feel the force.</font>

393
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not allowed to.</font>

394
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I feel?</font>

395
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel Dracula force.</font>

396
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel Dracula signals.</font>

397
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ass is mine.</font>

398
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">That last stunt you pulled put six
of my best guys in the hospital.</font>

399
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maniac.</font>

400
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more than a maniac.</font>

401
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Dracula.</font>

402
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:25,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Oh my
God, Jesus Christ they shot him.</font>

403
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:30,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who am I? What's my motivation?</font>

404
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I doing or saying anything
that I am saying or doing,</font>

405
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:37,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more, I need more
than what I'm getting.</font>

406
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was incredible.</font>

407
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

408
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:03,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long is it?
- 87 minutes.</font>

409
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it to eight one, that means 81.</font>

410
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make some calls, we'll
premiere this thing, and</font>

411
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:08,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll get your school a check.</font>

412
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

413
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">So which six minutes should we cut?</font>

414
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hm.</font>

415
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:18,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's death scene probably, right?</font>

416
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:19,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah.</font>

417
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mine?
- Yeah, in the space dungeon?</font>

418
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:22,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no Chang in that.</font>

419
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long is Jeff's death scene?</font>

420
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, how long is it. We're
really zeroing in on it.</font>

421
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm frightened?</font>

422
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">These chains were forged
from the iron of Ganymede.</font>

423
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the steel, I'm not going
to tell you where he is.</font>

424
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:44,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather die.</font>

425
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:49,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm. Hm, it seems pretty important
he doesn't give doesn't give up Chang.</font>

426
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, otherwise the last thing he
says to him is, I'll see you in Hell.</font>

427
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not really a movie about him.</font>

428
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:59,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Hm-hm.
- Well, what about your steel drum solo?</font>

429
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't think we should lose that.</font>

430
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what about the weird wedding
ritual on Glip Glop's planet, huh?</font>

431
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

432
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not throw out the
baby with the bath water.</font>

433
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not getting a frame of Glip Glop.</font>

434
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's like cutting
Cowboy out of Midnight Cowboy.</font>

435
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:12,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

436
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's death scene is
six minutes 30 seconds.</font>

437
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There you go.- Oh, there you go.</font>

438
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:18,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cool.</font>

439
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy enough.</font>

440
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we, before we finish editing,</font>

441
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:24,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">should we get those
hornets out of the garbage?</font>

442
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those swarming hornets.</font>

443
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:29,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

444
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:33,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that serious?
- Is he doing a bit...</font>

445
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a long bit.
- Oh, he's serious.</font>

446
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's face it.</font>

447
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty obvious when he's acting.</font>

448
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

449
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this.</font>

450
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, yo, yo.</font>

451
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:48,697

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Kyle Beiderman.</font>

454
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that Kyle Beiderman.</font>

455
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:57,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone, Abed.</font>

456
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I've watched this
tutorial on how editing works,</font>

457
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna save this movie
without removing its soul.</font>

458
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:04,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step one.</font>

459
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to correctly label your files.</font>

460
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares about labeling
files, teach me to edit.</font>

461
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:12,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

462
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay away!</font>

463
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my movie too!</font>

464
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:20,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not even a movie
Jeff, it's a piece of crap.</font>

465
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:21,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean it can't be good.</font>

466
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's basically exactly what it means.</font>

467
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:25,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay away Abed.</font>

468
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not kidding.</font>

469
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm huge and I have zero blood sugar.</font>

470
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:32,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill you in these frisbees
and nobody will ever find you.</font>

471
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:33,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

472
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now let's get familiar
with the user interface.</font>

473
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, just teach me to edit.</font>

474
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bazinga.</font>

475
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:45,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill you.</font>

476
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're killing me!</font>

477
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you!</font>

478
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're literally killing me.</font>

479
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:50,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real?</font>

480
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

481
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:57,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you nuts?</font>

482
00:20:57,578 --> 00:21:00,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong with you?</font>

483
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single one of you was
gonna leave here except for me.</font>

484
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:07,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, Shirley, Annie's gonna be President.</font>

485
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Pierce got to die.</font>

486
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Chang goes to Hollywood.</font>

487
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:14,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we force you to make the
crappiest movie of all time,</font>

488
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:16,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we force you
to make it even crappier.</font>

489
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we watch it, and it's
still not even that bad.</font>

490
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the part I accidentally got
the most excited about is the seven</font>

491
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:21,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">minutes we can cut.</font>

492
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:24,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what that means?</font>

493
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means I'm a genius,
but we already knew that.</font>

494
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finally know in my heart,</font>

495
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:32,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I will literally be
the last one of us here.</font>

496
00:21:32,477 --> 00:21:35,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know, they gave digital
muscles to Chris Pratt in Guardians of</font>

497
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:36,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Galaxy.</font>

498
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:37,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watch Parks and Rec.</font>

499
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:39,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched it. There's no
scientific explanation for...</font>

500
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm, Jeff.</font>

501
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:46,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You helped me learn something about
film making today that I think we all</font>

502
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">need to apply to life.</font>

503
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay to plan some stuff, and</font>

504
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's okay to figure out what we did wrong.</font>

505
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our plans are randomly
gonna fall apart and</font>

506
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">our lessons are randomly
gonna be wrong, and</font>

507
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:56,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we just keep the cameras rolling
and shoot a lot of crap eventually</font>

508
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie is going to reach down her
shirt and pull out a laser bomb.</font>

509
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:02,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't write that, we didn't plan that.</font>

510
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:04,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">God made that happen.</font>

511
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:09,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">God made this movie, and it's dumb.</font>

512
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're dumb for being in it.</font>

513
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:13,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is a big, dumb,</font>

514
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">pointless movie with no story and an
abrupt ending where the hero gets shot</font>

515
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:19,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">by Dracula in the middle of a
lunch order during an outtake.</font>

516
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:22,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">But somewhere in there,
every once in a while.</font>

517
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:23,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie reaches down her shirt.</font>

518
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:35,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we keep the cameras rolling, and
we edit out the parts we don't like,</font>

519
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we stop thinking about Chris Pratt
so much, because it is not healthy.</font>

520
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:50,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you do me a favor?</font>

521
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never tell anybody about
our private conversations.</font>

522
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:53,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't really know how.</font>

523
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's cut my stupid scene
out of this piece of crap.</font>

524
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then won't we need to add 30 seconds?</font>

525
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:00,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea about that.</font>

526
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:02,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who am I?</font>

527
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:04,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my motivation?</font>

528
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:07,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I doing or saying
anything, I'm saying or doing?</font>

529
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, am I married?</font>

530
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:09,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more.</font>

531
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:11,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more than what I'm getting.</font>

532
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:21,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello Chief Star.</font>

533
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:27,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I'd see you in hell.</font>

534
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:30,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look who else is here.</font>

535
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yooba dooba dooba.</font>

536
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woo hoo hoo!</font>

537
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:50,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great job you guys, on the new ending.</font>

538
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:53,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that the guy
actually saw him in hell.</font>

539
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

540
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa.</font>

541
00:23:55,623 --> 00:24:02,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, phone call from the
distributor, get ready for a big check.</font>

542
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yellow.</font>

543
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

544
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

545
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's chapter 11?</font>

546
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:10,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

547
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's YouTube?</font>

548
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:11,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

549
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's broadband?</font>

550
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's digital?</font>

551
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:16,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a good
feeling about that call.</font>

552
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a good feeling
about Chang staying bankable.</font>

553
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you guys see this news story?</font>

554
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never look at hot air
ballooning the same way again.</font>

555
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:25,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or James Franco's balls.</font>

556
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

557
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you what I do
have a good feeling about.</font>

558
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:31,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it in.</font>

559
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:32,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

560
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

561
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, one more for safety Ben.</font>

562
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, one more for safety?</font>

563
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just don't know if we
get the line, hold on Slinky.</font>

564
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move on.</font>

565
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:52,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I think, can, can we get one more?</font>

566
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:53,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it!</font>

567
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Hold on, Slinky!</font>

568
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:56,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

569
00:24:56,606 --> 00:25:00,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it was fine, but
Steven's kind of a stickler.</font>

570
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:03,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Steven Spielberg to lick my butt.</font>

571
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:05,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's right here, so.</font>

572
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:11,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Steven Spielberg.</font>

573
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:12,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you give us a sec?</font>

574
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

575
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:24,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben?</font>

576
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

577
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:28,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I guess we're good for today.</font>

578
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great job, you were right.</font>

579
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got everything we need.</font>

580
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:35,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, there's a small door in the
back, back of the booth there,</font>

581
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">that will take you, you know, outside.</font>

582
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, we'll talk soon.</font>

583
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:41,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't go the way I came?</font>

584
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not.</font>

585
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a little door back
there, and it goes right on out.</font>

586
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:47,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much.</font>

587
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:49,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

588
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:53,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

589
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Randall, are you ready?</font>

590
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:14,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

591
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:22,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which brings us to the issue</font>

592
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:30,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">of our cosmetology department,</font>

593
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:33,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">who once again,</font>

594
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:39,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">find themselves.</font>

595
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:43,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who, once again, find
themselves nearing the end of</font>

596
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:47,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">the semester without any
free haircut volunteers.</font>

597
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:59,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may be due to last
semester's lice scare.</font>

598
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

599
00:27:01,071 --> 00:27:01,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

600
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe if we put up a
sign, guaranteed no lice.</font>

601
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:08,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something like that.</font>

602
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:11,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would open you up to lawsuits.</font>

603
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son, we live in a world that has walls, and</font>

604
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:16,592
