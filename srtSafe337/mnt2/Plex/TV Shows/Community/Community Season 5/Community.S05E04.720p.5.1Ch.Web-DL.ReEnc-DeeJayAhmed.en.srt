1
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:04,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was a weird afternoon.</font>

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:08,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I knew Pierce
was part of a weird, futuristic cult...</font>

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:11,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I wasn't prepared for a funeral
with so much beeping.</font>

4
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's not judge.</font>

5
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:14,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone has a right...</font>

6
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:17,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">to whatever fake religion
they delusionally choose.</font>

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you were by the coffin
for a long time. Are you okay?</font>

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:23,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay. Although...</font>

9
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed are in mourning</font>

10
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:27,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stop doing that.</font>

11
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:31,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you did it
during your eulogy. So uncomfortable.</font>

12
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think they got we were singing
"mourning" with a U.</font>

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were singing "mourning" with a U?
Oh, no.</font>

14
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't fully understand
the laser lotus theology.</font>

15
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Pierce's body is in the coffin,
and we buried it...</font>

16
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:47,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this energon pod
contains his life vapour?</font>

17
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:51,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right here in this incredibly
persuasive literature they passed out.</font>

18
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:54,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you reach level 16,
you can see the colour blurble.</font>

19
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ridiculous cartoon nonsense.
If there is a blurble...</font>

20
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:00,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... the Lord keeps it hidden for a reason.
- What up, N-bombs?</font>

21
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was the funeral? Awesome?</font>

22
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:05,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Chang, our friend's funeral
was not awesome.</font>

23
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was deeply sad.
You know, funeral style.</font>

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
I thought you guys hated Pierce.</font>

25
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- We didn't hate Pierce.</font>

26
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craziness.</font>

27
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:17,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you guys aren't just doing
the "respect the dead" jig-a-lig?</font>

28
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you have us mistaken
for you, Chang.</font>

29
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:24,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I definitely remember
you complaining about him a lot.</font>

30
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Complained about him
when he was alive. This is different.</font>

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can't believe we'll never see him again.
- Reminder, gotta live life to the fullest.</font>

32
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:35,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time Pierce was my age,
he had already been fired from 15 jobs.</font>

33
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've only seen two Police Academys.</font>

34
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:39,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last two.</font>

35
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's gone too soon
but won't be soon forgotten.</font>

36
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would say you're quite correct,
Mr. Winger.</font>

37
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Mr. Stone.</font>

38
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's easy for you to say.</font>

39
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for us to say.</font>

40
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I work for Mr. Hawthorne.</font>

41
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:56,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">He specified in his will that no matter
how natural in appearance...</font>

42
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:58,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">the circumstances of his death...</font>

43
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:02,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">a private inquest should be conducted
to determine whether any one of you...</font>

44
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">his former study group...</font>

45
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">murdered him.</font>

46
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:06,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- To be cleared...</font>

47
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must all submit
to a polygraph test.</font>

48
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schnizzle, you guys are in trouble.</font>

49
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Later.
- Mr. Chang, I presume.</font>

50
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're also listed as a suspect
and requested to participate.</font>

51
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, but I ask the questions.</font>

52
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:25,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm afraid I can't allow that.
- All right, then just the "fine" part.</font>

53
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:28,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're losing Pierce.</font>

54
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, quickly.</font>

55
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone get a balloon.</font>

56
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:07,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wanted to try a polygraph.
Like the pie fight of cop movies.</font>

57
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the acupuncture
of the legal system.</font>

58
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't believe Pierce'd think
we might murder him.</font>

59
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what a waste of murder.
I mean, he was, like, 79.</font>

60
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't suppose anyone wants to know
I consider this a violation.</font>

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, it's just Pierce being Pierce.</font>

62
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Final wish.
- If I had a final wish...</font>

63
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... I'd use it to stay alive.
- Do it. How do we begin?</font>

64
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna start with Ms. Perry.</font>

65
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">- State your name.
- Britta Perry.</font>

66
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had any thoughts of violence
towards Pierce?</font>

67
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:31,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Lie.</font>

68
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we all wanted to slap him
now and again, but I didn't kill him.</font>

69
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">In all your sexual fantasies
about Pierce...</font>

70
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... none of them involved his murder?
- What? No.</font>

71
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had sexual fantasies
about Mr. Hawthorne.</font>

72
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! What kind of question is that?
- I'm asking the questions...</font>

73
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:48,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">just as Mr. Hawthorne
wrote them down, I assure you.</font>

74
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:51,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Winger, state your name.
- Jeffrey Winger.</font>

75
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you gay?
- No.</font>

76
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sure you're not gay?
- Yes.</font>

77
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gay murderer says what?
- What?</font>

78
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:59,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's telling the truth.
- I'll point out that means you're gay.</font>

79
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ms. Bennett. State your name.
- Shirley Bennett.</font>

80
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a dishonest person?</font>

81
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- She thinks that's true.</font>

82
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have just said no.
I'm watching you acting scientific...</font>

83
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:11,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then adding your little two cents
every now and again. Continue.</font>

84
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:16,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you're a donor with the pro-life
organisation prenatalpatriots. org?</font>

85
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Keep it cool, girls.</font>

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my money. It's my choice.</font>

87
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:24,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wanted the government in my uterus,
I'd fill it with oil and Hispanic voters.</font>

88
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it frosty.
Don't let your goats get got.</font>

89
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Barnes, state your name.</font>

90
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy Barnes.</font>

91
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant to say Butts Carlton.</font>

92
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did mean to say Butts Carlton.</font>

93
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barnes, you get angry
when Mr. Hawthorne told you...</font>

94
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fat Albert died of diabetes?</font>

95
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, like any American would.</font>

96
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Angry enough to murder him?
- No.</font>

97
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you and Abed Nadir have
an elaborate doomsday escape plan...</font>

98
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be used in the event
of zombie attacks?</font>

99
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">We may have
a designated rendezvous point...</font>

100
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:56,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a couple of bug-out bags
filled with gold coins and condoms...</font>

101
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">in case we need to bargain our way
onto a boat. Gold coins for buying food.</font>

102
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does your doomsday plan account for
the welfare of any of your other friends?</font>

103
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pass.
- Answer the question.</font>

104
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Troy. Rude.</font>

105
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a doomsday plan, not a picnic plan.</font>

106
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:15,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna see the horrors we might
have to endure just to get on a boat?</font>

107
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guess not.
- That's a lie.</font>

108
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's doing it again.</font>

109
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:19,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce is doing it again.</font>

110
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Chang, state your name.</font>

111
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:25,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Benjamin Franklin Chang,
ready to deal out the truth.</font>

112
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing to hide. Let's do this.</font>

113
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever masturbated
in the study room?</font>

114
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:36,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Nadir, state your name.
- Abed Nadir.</font>

115
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you ever 9/11 'd anyone?
- No.</font>

116
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you were a child, did you kill a
squirrel, surprised you felt nothing...</font>

117
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:46,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wonder if you were capable
of doing it to a human?</font>

118
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

119
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you and Troy still use
Jeff's Netflix account...</font>

120
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:57,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... without his permission?
- You told Pierce that?</font>

121
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">You logged in at our place,
never logged out.</font>

122
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why my review of The Grey
is changing?</font>

123
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:04,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop giving it four stars.
- I like Liam Neeson.</font>

124
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:06,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send him a message about roles.</font>

125
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the issue.
You're stealing from me.</font>

126
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:11,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as your roommate,
you're making me an accomplice.</font>

127
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had no idea.
- Lie.</font>

128
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I even try that?</font>

129
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:17,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- State your name please, miss.
- Annie Edison.</font>

130
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you use your intelligence
and organizational skills...</font>

131
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">to plot the foolproof murder
of Pierce Hawthorne?</font>

132
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no.</font>

133
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:28,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you overcharged Troy and
Abed for their share of the rent?</font>

134
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce.
- Annie?</font>

135
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but for a good reason.</font>

136
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys know
you're bad with money.</font>

137
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I padded your share of the rent
by $10.</font>

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been putting it into a savings
account that yields 4 percent.</font>

139

when you find out you have $86.</font>

140
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:46,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's jacket money.</font>

141
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:49,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear that, Abed?
We've been washing paper plates...</font>

142
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">and making our own toothpaste.
Don't worry.</font>

143
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:54,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we have robot bodies,
we can share a free jacket.</font>

144
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:57,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should know better than to hoard
money. That's a stereotype.</font>

145
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was that anti-Semitism?
- No.</font>

146
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's sensitivity.</font>

147
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:04,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's anti-Semitic to do things like that
when you know you're Jewish.</font>

148
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could have bought a tyre
for our tyre swing.</font>

149
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:09,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or your own Netflix account?</font>

150
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam Neeson? Not that great.</font>

151
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if you were ever gonna get that tyre.</font>

152
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

153
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:19,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin.</font>

154
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.
What do you mean, "begin"?</font>

155
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:26,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">That completes calibration questioning.
We're ready to begin the inquest.</font>

156
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're ready to end.
We've humoured this long enough.</font>

157
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, it's for Pierce.</font>

158
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:33,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, respect for the dead
is only a thing...</font>

159
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:36,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the dead usually
don't do any more damage.</font>

160
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's true.
- You can quit any time you like.</font>

161
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be noted Mr. Hawthorne's
estate is worth over $20 million.</font>

162
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:46,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only those cleared of his murder
can receive their bequeathments.</font>

163
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only gonna say this once.
Clearly, Pierce is trying to lure us...</font>

164
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:54,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a labyrinth of emotional
manipulation and strategic instigation.</font>

165
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all smart enough to know
we should quit while we're not ahead.</font>

166
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do believe we should.
- Yes, definitely.</font>

167
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Absolutely.
- Right.</font>

168
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're all lying.
- We all know that, you judgmental bitch.</font>

169
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:14,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Perry, have you ever eaten
at the sandwich shop...</font>

170
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">started by Mrs. Bennett
and Mr. Hawthorne?</font>

171
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- And what sandwich would you order?</font>

172
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one I can,
the Helen of Soy with no mayo.</font>

173
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Helen of Soy.
- Are you aware that to save money...</font>

174
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:29,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley stopped using real tofu and
replaced it with Midwestern tofu...</font>

175
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:31,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">called meatfu?</font>

176
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

177
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still not actually meat, legally.</font>

178
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:39,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have never respected anything
that I hold sacred.</font>

179
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Did you know that Britta...</font>

180
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">was high on marijuana
at your son's baptism?</font>

181
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

182
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, no higher than usual.
- Not true.</font>

183
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did drugs in my church?</font>

184
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did drugs in the parking lot
of your church.</font>

185
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you expect somebody
to sit through something like that?</font>

186
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a bris,
there's an element of suspense.</font>

187
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time, I'll have Cheech and Chong
do warm-up.</font>

188
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, these questions
are obviously designed...</font>

189
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">to turn us against each other.
If we wanna beat Pierce...</font>

190
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">we own up to our mistakes
and forgive each other.</font>

191
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, is it true that you keep
trophies of your sexual conquests?</font>

192
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a church, Britta?</font>

193
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">For shame.</font>

194
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's where Jesus gets his mail.</font>

195
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:20,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer the question, Adrien Grody.</font>

196
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what Pierce is referring to.</font>

197
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a box of forgotten items
in my apartment.</font>

198
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I happen to be a single male.</font>

199
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Visitors leave things.</font>

200
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is one of your trophies
a pair of Ms. Perry's panties?</font>

201
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me a hawk stole them.</font>

202
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You exploited me...</font>

203
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:39,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">and made me believe
in a slightly more magical world.</font>

204
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:41,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">To collect women's underwear,
can't you buy them?</font>

205
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have to be won in battle.</font>

206
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gross.
- Awesome.</font>

207
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:49,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we can all agree the gross thing
is Pierce snooping through my stuff.</font>

208
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed and I go through
your stuff all the time.</font>

209
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why keep bread in the freezer?</font>

210
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why's your bathroom mirror
say "you're special"?</font>

211
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:59,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't have to ans... You took a shower?
- Yeah.</font>

212
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Barnes.
- Okay. I did it, okay? I killed Pierce.</font>

213
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lie.
- Okay, good.</font>

214
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just making sure.</font>

215
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Abed have a specialised,
exclusive handshake you refuse to do...</font>

216
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... with your other friends?
- Absolutely.</font>

217
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Barnes,
did you invent that handshake?</font>

218
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Lie.</font>

219
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:19,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Barnes, are you a subscriber
to the video blog Fun For Friends?</font>

220
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Lie.</font>

221
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:21,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence, wench!</font>

222
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:24,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Kevin.</font>

223
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Kyle, and here's a fun handshake
you can do with your best friend.</font>

224
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Thanks for watching, guys.</font>

225
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:34,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget to rate us,
comment, and subscribe.</font>

226
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't look at you.
- You should know I'm crying.</font>

227
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgive you. To escape the pattern
of self-righteous indignation...</font>

228
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... followed by immediate comeuppance.
- Mr. Nadir.</font>

229
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening. You broke my heart.
Continue.</font>

230
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:48,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you planted trafficking devices
on everyone so you'd know...</font>

231
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... where they are at all times?
- Yes.</font>

232
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're changing your faces.
Mad at me or hungry?</font>

233
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're tracking us?</font>

234
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're mad at you, Abed.
- Why?</font>

235
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:02,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we already live
in a totalitarian surveillance state.</font>

236
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you not read my updates?
- I'm not the government. I'm your friend.</font>

237
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what governments say, nimrod.</font>

238
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:12,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">When one of you gets kidnapped
you'll be glad you don't have to count...</font>

239
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:16,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... the bumps from the trunk of a car.
- Are those blinking dots us?</font>

240
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this one all the way to the side?
- That's where Pierce is buried.</font>

241
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:24,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you were spending
so much time by the coffin?</font>

242
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to get it back.
They're expensive.</font>

243
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed,
where did you plant these things?</font>

244
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel better, you'll never find them.</font>

245
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:35,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you know it's wrong to do that
without telling us. Shame on you.</font>

246
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, I'm ashamed. Lie.
- Lie.</font>

247
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Edison, is it true you once dosed
the members of your group...</font>

248
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a pharmaceutical
amphetamine?</font>

249
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, kind of.
- What?</font>

250
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds worse on paper than it was.</font>

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were cramming for the anthro final.
Everyone was falling asleep.</font>

252
00:11:56,277 --> 00:12:00,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put 5 milligrams of something in your
coffees and we all got an A. Done.</font>

253
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bad person for tracking you,
but you altered brain chemistry?</font>

254
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was up for three days.</font>

255

<font color="#FFFFFF">I invented a language,
you fiiztbarping gitzgorg.</font>

256
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry.
- You messed with my brain. A big deal.</font>

257
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mess with your brain, Annie.</font>

258
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You kind of do.
- I don't think I do.</font>

259
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about her Facebook boyfriend?
- It's different.</font>

260
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:20,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made a profile for a fake dude
and lured her into a relationship.</font>

261
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's catfishing you.</font>

you hummed a lot and made pancakes.</font>

264
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I did
in the name of breakfast.</font>

265
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bore my soul to you.</font>

266
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you about my
holding hands at Disneyland fantasy.</font>

267

<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you care about people at all, Abed?</font>

268
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer on the polygraph.</font>

269
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,503

I mean, what is hell?</font>

that Pierce was dead.</font>

280
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that's what he wanted.</font>

281
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or he wanted us to know
we're no better off without him.</font>

282
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or no better than him.</font>

283
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:27,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kind of nailed it, didn't he?</font>

284
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't just masturbate

00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:34,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I masturbated everywhere.</font>

286
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everywhere!</font>

287
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confession is good for the soul.</font>

288
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:45,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try it sometime.</font>

289
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:54,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another round of questions,
if you'd like to continue.</font>

290
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:58,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us a moment to sit in our own filth
before you heap another bucket on us.</font>

291
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:02,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange, after all these years how much
we've kept hidden from each other.</font>

292
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think by now we would
have learned to be better people.</font>

293
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:09,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we got into this mess by thinking
there was such a thing as better people.</font>

294
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. That's it.</font>

295
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:16,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're no better than Pierce,
Pierce is no worse than us...</font>

296
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">then that means
nobody's really that bad.</font>

297
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what if we're willing to suffer
and inflict pain...</font>

298
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the mere prospect
of material reward?</font>

299
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we stop now,
that doesn't make us better.</font>

300
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just makes us so dishonest...</font>

301
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:32,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we would rather be poor
than admit we're flawed.</font>

302
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce admitted he was flawed,
and he died rich.</font>

303
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:40,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's celebrate his life and death
in the honest way...</font>

304
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">not by saying fake nice things
around a casket...</font>

305
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">but by admitting we're monsters and
clawing joyfully for some of his cash.</font>

306
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:52,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">So does anybody have anything left
before we continue?</font>

307
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:56,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's empty our tanks of lies
once and for all.</font>

308
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jeff Winger,
and if I had my choice...</font>

309
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would rather look at myself naked
than the women I sleep with.</font>

310
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one who hit Jeff's Lexus
in the parking lot.</font>

311
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't a taco truck.</font>

312
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:10,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Racist of me to improvise
such an ethnically specific vehicle.</font>

313
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:13,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only give money to homeless people
when I'm with someone.</font>

314

<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been to Legoland.</font>

315
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted you guys
to think I was cool.</font>

316
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can be passive-aggressive
sometimes.</font>

317
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:22,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't everybody disagree at once.</font>

318
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:25,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Lord, I did it again.
- When you chew gum I wanna punch you.</font>

319
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">May as well have machine guns
in your mouths. Vibrates my skull.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody clear?</font>

321
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- All right.</font>

322
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Stone,
hit us with your grand finale.</font>

323
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:37,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">May it be as brutal as we deserve.</font>

324
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

of questions.</font>

326

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Britta Perry. Do you know that you
hate yourself more than you should...</font>

327
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,761

328
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

329
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:51,856

a credit to your race and gender...</font>

I can't believe I didn't tell you yet.</font>
