1
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:05,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Russell Borchert,
computer genius,</font>

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">anti-deodorant activist,
and millionaire.</font>

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was rich for having invented
the 9-track cassette,</font>

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:15,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">which the 8-track industry
paid to keep quiet.</font>

5
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">He funneled that wealth into a
computer school called Greendale,</font>

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">where he obsessively
pursued a new project,</font>

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">a machine that can
process feelings.</font>

8
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:28,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">He apparently used nothing but
gold to assemble his circuitry,</font>

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">believing it to be a better
conductor of human emotion.</font>

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a weird time. The
Bionic Woman won an Emmy.</font>

11
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rumors spread about his
relationship with computers,</font>

12
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one day, he disappeared,</font>

13
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:42,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">hence the legend that he died
of the first computer virus.</font>

14
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city bought the
campus, and life went on.</font>

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">His body was never found,
nor was his immense wealth.</font>

16
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:52,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people said he hid his money
using a portal to another dimension.</font>

17
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:57,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people were on LSD. Everyone else
said he had a secret vault in his office.</font>

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, where's his office?
- Good question.</font>

19
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:04,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found this confession written
by Greendale's first Dean.</font>

20
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To protect the student health
and the school's reputation,</font>

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I have sealed off the
computer department</font>

22
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and removed the stairwell
to that entire section."</font>

23
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:16,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">A section that remains on this campus
somewhere, its secrets untouched,</font>

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">including quite possibly
Borchert's millions.</font>

25
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:22,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we found it, we could buy it
from the city before Subway.</font>

26
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:24,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I could really go
nuts with this place.</font>

27
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the kind of adventure
I usually have to force upon us,</font>

28
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:28,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here it is, falling
into our laps.</font>

29
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like the Goonies, except
our story tracks logically</font>

30
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:32,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">and has a chance of holding up
to objective critical scrutiny.</font>

31
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you please stop that?
- Sorry.</font>

32
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:40,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here are your blueprints. Sorry it took
so long. You can't fight city hall.</font>

33
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:43,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently you can. That's
why it took so long.</font>

34
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:44,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll be damned.
Would you look at that?</font>

35
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so clear now. The entire
school is shaped like a penis.</font>

36
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:52,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that. It says right here that this
stairway leads to sublevel three.</font>

37
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that where the
teachers' lounge is?</font>

38
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell does
your penis look like?</font>

39
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:00,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously a cluster of buildings, so
let's all have a big laugh at the freak.</font>

- You shut up.</font>

118
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:16,737

- Just spider webs and beanbag chairs.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, but it's gonna take a
few hours to get that door open,</font>

285
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Raquel's
logic circuits...</font>

286
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">bleh, not good.</font>

287
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said her emotional
components work.</font>

288
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:56,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in theory, a blast of human
passion could shock the mainframe</font>

289
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a cold start, but that's
only if somebody in this room</font>

290
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">has feelings stronger than
I get when I rub my nipples,</font>

291
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">so good luck with
that, folks.</font>

292
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that.</font>

293
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody over there.
Turn around.</font>

294
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around now.</font>

295
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,182
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're here to save
me, aren't you?</i></font>

296
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,072
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Let's get out of here
and never look back.</i></font>

297
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,591
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jeff, in case you ever have
to remember me,</i></font>

298
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:25,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>can I give you some options for
voice-over quotes?</i> - <i>Shut up, Abed.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Milady.
- Milord.</i></font>

300
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:41,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did you do?
- Don't worry about it. Let's go.</font>

301
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">The city of
Greendale is proud</font>

302
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be selling the school
of Greendale to Subway.</font>

303
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:54,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">This brings to an
end several years</font>

304
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:59,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">of horrible management
by Dean Craig Isidore Pelton.</font>

305
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to throw anyone under the
bus, but he'd be the one.</font>

306
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:09,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by my watch, it is about time to sign
these documents and make it official.</font>

307
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Objection! I teach
law at Greendale,</font>

308
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:15,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">so believe me, I don't
know much about law,</font>

309
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do know a contract
violation when I see one.</font>

310
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:23,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a legitimate transaction where a
city is selling a school to a restaurant.</font>

311
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happens somewhere
every day.</font>

312
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:28,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the city can sell the
school all it wants,</font>

313
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">but according to his
contract with the city,</font>

314
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:35,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">the school's original founder retains
the privilege of consultation</font>

315
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">on all future scholastic
endeavors taking place here.</font>

316
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:45,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Subway Sandwich University, meet
your new Vice Dean, Russell Borchert.</font>

317
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

318
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:59,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I guess we're
gonna be partners.</font>

319
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand there's
some internet</font>

320
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I can make my
inner thoughts public.</font>

321
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:05,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like
Greendale the city</font>

322
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Greendale the school
have some stuff to sort out,</font>

323
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Subway doesn't...
doesn't do conflict.</font>

324
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do good food
at good prices.</font>

325
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are but simple
sandwich artists</font>

326
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">who want the world
to eat fresh.</font>

327
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat fresh!</font>

328
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subway, ho!</font>

329
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we just save Greendale?</font>

330
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:34,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did we just save Greendale?
- No, no, you did not.</font>

331
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You moved dirt around
Greendale's grave.</font>

332
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your school is still bankrupt,
it is still unmarketable,</font>

333
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it is still on the
permanent chopping block</font>

334
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:47,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">of anyone who has any
say in its future.</font>

335
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

336
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:52,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, around here, we
call that Wednesday.</font>

337
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:00,297
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ He wakes up in
the morning ♪</i></font>

338

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ Never changes a thing ♪</i></font>

339
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, after I was
electrocuted,</font>

340
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't you two say you
were gonna get married?</font>

341
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't electrocuted
technically mean killed?</font>

342
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you always have to
correct people like that?</font>

343
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you always have
to police correcting?</font>

344
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's it. The marriage is off.
- I think you mean the wedding is off.</font>

345
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:21,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Hey, hey.</font>

346
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I got to say, you held up
well under that interrogation.</font>

347
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:29,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna tell you something that
I'd like to stay between us.</font>

348
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

349
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:33,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking about
a hang glider.</font>

350
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:36,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of this conflict
truly matters.</font>

land are the Arapaho.</font>

train me in the use of certain powers?</font>

353
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Carl. You
deserve better.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, you get it.</font>

355
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:53,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like a job
on the school board?</font>

356
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

357
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:59,981

to the city bursar's office.</font>

358

all my teeth with diamonds.</font>

another day.</font>

chance to wish you a happy birthday</font>

- Definitely.</font>
