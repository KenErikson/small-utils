<font color="#FFFFFF">Save Greendale Committee, please
welcome our newest member,</font>

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">math teacher Ben Chang.</font>

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's get serious.</font>

4
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:17,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've compiled a short list of the
most immediate Greendale emergencies.</font>

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is deforestation on the list?</font>

6
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:22,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, for one, am glad
that this is happening.</font>

7
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:24,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">What this school needs
is a band of heroes,</font>

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:29,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">champions willing to rise up and "get
all those potatoes out of the gym."</font>

9
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like House Vagadosh in the HBO
original series Bloodlines of Conquest.</font>

10
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:35,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloodlines of Conquest.
That's my show right there.</font>

11
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That is a good show.
- They really get the incest right.</font>

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is
Bloodlines of Conquest?</font>

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a medieval fantasy series.</font>

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's based on these great books that
nobody seems to read. It's great.</font>

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got betrayal, boobs,
espionage, dragons.</font>

16
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, dragons? Is that a spoiler?
I just started season one.</font>

17
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:55,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't start watching shows
until they're so popular</font>

18
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">that watching them is
no longer a statement.</font>

19
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:59,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">So because you're three seasons behind,
we have to live in a fantasy world</font>

20
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">where there's no such
thing as dragons?</font>

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we also have to pretend that
Lord Stevarios is still alive?</font>

22
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:05,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Abed.</font>

23
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:07,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about I just buy all the
Bloodlines of Conquest books,</font>

24
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:10,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">read ahead, and spoil
the whole series for you?</font>

25
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:12,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's insane. That's something
an insane person would do.</font>

26
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knuckleheads, focus.
Item one,</font>

27
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Greendale student
census is out of date.</font>

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, Abed, why don't you
partner up on that one?</font>

29
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give you a chance
to squash this beef.</font>

30
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next, the midterm
dance is tonight.</font>

31
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:25,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to be on the
decorating committee?</font>

32
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- No.</font>

33
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:27,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine, I'll do it.
- I'll do it.</font>

34
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will be on that committee.
- Me too.</font>

35
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:33,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys volunteering because
you think I'll do all the work?</font>

36
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wouldn't.
- No. Not at all.</font>

37
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:36,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care enough
to lie, so no.</font>

38
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:41,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will reward that honesty by
giving you something easy.</font>

39
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bulletin board fell down in the
cafeteria a couple months ago.</font>

40
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:45,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think you can get
it hung back up?</font>

41
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:47,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll give it a drive-by.
- Great.</font>

42
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have now completed
our first task,</font>

43
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,496

your last idea was to murder.</font>

bump that up a little,</font>

102
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a difference?</font>

103
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just starting
to like you.</font>

104
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had enough?</font>

105
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:09,591

106
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,281

00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,776

126
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:22,939

were hoping to get that up...</font>

134
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:48,706

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's election time.</font>

it's an uphill battle.</font>

138
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">For example, look at this.</font>

139
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:04,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of the websites we try and visit
get blocked by this weird filter thing.</font>

140

work order for a bulletin board</font>

141
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the bottom of the queue to
the top. Now how can I do that</font>

00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:13,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I'm dealing with this?</font>

143

<font color="#FFFFFF">They want their porn unblocked.</font>

144
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:18,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they'll give
you your board.</font>

145
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what that was?
How did you know?</font>

146
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you investigate pornography
when you were a cop?</font>

147
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eh, something like that.
- So he wants a bribe.</font>

148
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the labyrinth, kid.</font>

149
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:30,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only there ain't no puppets or
bisexual rock stars down here.</font>

150
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">And at the center of it
all, if you're lucky,</font>

151
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">a piece of cork
and a few pins.</font>

152
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what, is it worth it?</font>

153
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what a bulletin
board is to you, Professor?</font>

154
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:42,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">A piece of cork? That's not what it
is to people that lose their pets,</font>

155
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">people that need rides,</font>

156
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:47,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">people whose bad bands
need bad bass players.</font>

157
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">To them, every pushpin has the
power to change the future.</font>

158
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">So yes, Professor, it's worth it.</font>

159
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a lady in the I.T.
Department.</font>

160
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'll put some
food on the tables,</font>

161
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:24,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll lower the lights, and
that's a midterm dance.</font>

162
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it could use a
little something theme-wise.</font>

163
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea.</font>

164
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bear Down for Midterms."</font>

165
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:42,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- "Bear Down for Midterms."</font>

166
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:46,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just repeat it.
You need to explain yourself.</font>

167
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's midterm time.</font>

168
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- People have to bear down,</font>

169
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:53,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">study hard, get to work.</font>

170
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's "Bear Down
for Midterms."</font>

171
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a dot I'm
not connecting?</font>

172
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-uh.
- It's a play on words.</font>

173
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:02,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Bear down" is an expression.
- I know the expression, Chang.</font>

174
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Fly on the wall"
is an expression,</font>

175
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if I want to pitch "Fly
on the Wall for Midterms,"</font>

176
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">you might ask, "What
do you mean?"</font>

177
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang?</font>

178
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ar-Are you crying?</font>

179
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand I've been
crazy in the past, but...</font>

180
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:23,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't make it any less frustrating
to be completely dismissed like this.</font>

181
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you guys even
see me as human anymore.</font>

182
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if it's
like a joke to you.</font>

183

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are all Asian men like a joke?
If it's like a racial thing. - No.</font>

184
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

I am still a human, and I...</font>

187

<font color="#FFFFFF">I do want to make a
difference and...</font>

188
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:45,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you respect that? Please?</font>

189
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang...</font>

190
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,844

191
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bear Down for Midterms.</font>

192
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. - Okay.
- Okay, well...</font>

193
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll... put up
some bear things?</font>

194
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:58,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll bear down.</font>

195
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">For midterms.</font>

196
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:01,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

197
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to lift web
restrictions solely for custodial?</font>

198
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need to have full access,
so they can research, um...</font>

what do you want?</font>

for you so that you can do this for us.</font>

it could work that way.</font>

205
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:24,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I could use
decent parking.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now they make
me park in Annex B.</font>

talk to parking.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Debra, let's be clear.</font>

211
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everything to get
through that porn blocker.</font>

212
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean everything?
- Everything!</font>

213
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understood.</font>

214
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:45,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very happy right now.</font>

215
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:48,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So just bears everywhere?
- Yep.</font>

216
00:10:49,254 --> 00:10:52,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we'll have
some cakes, party hats,</font>

217
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:53,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">birthday stuff!</font>

218
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,758

better than I thought.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, birthday stuff?</font>

220
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Duncan.
- Okay, I'm sorry.</font>

221
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Birthday stuff.</font>

222
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've been sad to see that bulletin
board down in the cafeteria for so long.</font>

223
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always had a passion
for bulletins.</font>

224
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">If parking for the I.T. guy puts
that board back where it belongs,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't stand in the way.</font>

226

speaking as a fan of bulletins...</font>

227
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to have the Dean appoint
someone to oversee them,</font>

228
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make sure bulletins stay
organized and protected.</font>

229
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll do it.
- We could look into that.</font>

230
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not to be that
guy, but, uh...</font>

231
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you could look into
that before I do this for you?</font>

232
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to control all the bulletin
boards in the school... why?</font>

233
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might want to start
talking turkey, Waldron,</font>

234
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the Macy's parade is almost
over, and grandma's getting drunk.</font>

power comes from, Miss Edison?</font>

236
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Parking spaces.
- Wrong.</font>

237
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was plenty of space
to park in dinosaur times,</font>

238
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not one single
parking department.</font>

239
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:51,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">My power comes from a
scarcity of parking,</font>

240
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">just like your dad's comes
from a lack of hugs.</font>

241
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what
takes my power away?</font>

242
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carpools.</font>

243
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carpools organized
through ride shares.</font>

244
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ride shares posted
on bulletin boards.</font>

245
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:06,298

head because we're done posturing.</font>

246

<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to talk turkey,
well, gobble gobble.</font>

247
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:10,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want ride shares gone.</font>

248
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's get out of here.
- All right.</font>

249
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I'll talk to the Dean.</font>

250
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say, I don't know what we did,
but we sure did the hell out of it.</font>

251
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the key to dance
decoration is just pick an idea.</font>

252
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then bear down.
Right, buddy?</font>

253
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:39,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here are your sodas.</font>

254
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:41,206

- Yeah. Bear down, baby.</font>

256
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too soon, you guys.
This is way too soon.</font>

257
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:49,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Too soon for wha...
- Too soon for this!</font>

258
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">After this morning
in Wisconsin?</font>

259
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:55,155

party, mauls a whole bunch of people?</font>

obviously a ghoulish reference to it?</font>

covering it all morning!</font>

something and forget you heard it,</font>

264
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,940

Oh, man. This is bad.</font>

up, you guys.</font>

267
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">An office of bulletin
board oversight.</font>

268
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,333

269
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,953

Get in here, buddy.</font>

274

<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.</font>

275

to be that guy,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">When, after he signs it?
After it's all too late?</font>

- You petty old man.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You went from being a cop to teaching
criminology because of the system, right?</font>

291
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately for Greendale,</font>

292
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:23,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to prove it by
getting nothing done.</font>

293
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's a bulletin for you...</font>

294
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Annie Edison doesn't
get nothing done."</font>

295
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yow. - And where should
I put that bulletin, Edison,</font>

296
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:34,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a sham piece of cork
controlled by a parking guy</font>

297
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:38,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">that lights his cigars
on student ride shares?</font>

298
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, Annie.</font>

299
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of labyrinth
have you created?</font>

300
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:46,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly not the magic kind with
puppets and macho rock stars.</font>

301
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You whored yourself out, kid.</font>

302
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted that board so bad</font>

303
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you made every board
on campus worthless,</font>

304
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:56,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in doing so made the
school just a shade dirtier.</font>

305
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought better of
you, young lady.</font>

306
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:03,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man. This got Sorkin-y.</font>

307
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:08,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I didn't think anything in
particular of you, and now I see why!</font>

308
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I didn't follow most of that,
but it feels like I ought to do this.</font>

309
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

310
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:26,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Annie. Um...</font>

311
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:27,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

312
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Fat Dog for Midterms"?</font>

313
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Pretty cool.</font>

314
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't understand.
- It's an expression.</font>

315
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Fat Dog for Midterm." Like,
don't sweat it, fat dog it.</font>

316
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang out, relax,
like a fat dog. Bah!</font>

317
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:40,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can look it up on Wikipedia.</font>

318
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's an entry in there.
- Yep.</font>

319
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never... uh... okay.
I just...</font>

320
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:49,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel like I'm missing...
- You know, Annie, um...</font>

321
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it feels like...</font>

322
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- you don't take us seriously.
- Aww.</font>

323
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:56,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess we bring it on ourselves,
but it's still pretty frustrating.</font>

324
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, is this a race thing?</font>

325
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:02,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Race!
- No! God, no! You guys!</font>

326
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accept that it's an expression, but
I don't see the connection to...</font>

327
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're overthinking, Annie.
It's decorating.</font>

328
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pick an idea and
bear down on it.</font>

329
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, really poor choice
of words, Ben... Too soon.</font>

330
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you guys are right. I'm sorry.
I've had a really hard day.</font>

331
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:20,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to just...</font>

332
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">fat dog this concept.</font>

333
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fat dog!
- Fat dog it, baby!</font>

334
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

335
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Abed, but to the
spoiler goes the victory.</font>

336
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I really liked her.</font>

337
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:11,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">She probably likes you too,
but she also likes cash.</font>

338
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm devastated.</font>

339
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I feel bad. But...</font>

340
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:22,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learned a lesson, and I gave a
differently abled person a job.</font>

341
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, now I really feel bad.
Wait, no. Come back!</font>

342
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's be fat dogs about this.</font>

343
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

344
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:37,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to you?</font>

345
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing. You never called.
- I'm sorry.</font>

346
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the year of the gas leak,
but I won't use that as an excuse.</font>

347
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can be inconsiderate and
a lot of other things.</font>

348
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too. I guess I could've
put in some effort.</font>

349
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to go
to lunch sometime?</font>

350
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">No,</font>

351
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to go to dinner. Now.</font>
