<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, excuse me, sir.</font>

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Cobra attacking a tourist
attraction with zero tactical value,</font>

11
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">and with all due respect to India,
why are we defending it?</font>

Put your brother on the phone.</font>

We're in the middle of a battle.</font>

You're making me look bad.</font>

Wingman, show us how it's done.</font>

it's true I killed Destro.</font>

But is it really a crime?</font>

60
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Cobra not a ruthless terrorist
organization determined to rule the world?</font>

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we never kill them, are
we not basically on their side?</font>

62
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:31,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And won't this war therefore last
forever unless we finish killing Cobra</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Fourth Wall.</font>

74
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I believe that what
we perceive as life</font>

75
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">is actually a syndicated
children's cartoon.</font>

76
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:10,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Shut up,
Fourth Wall.</font>

77
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this were a cartoon, there'd
be a word for "cartoon"</font>

78
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">in our language,
which there isn't.</font>

79
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:18,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'd also be less movement, less detail,
and constant lip-sync mistakes.</font>

80
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:22,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I told you there was
more, a higher reality,</font>

81
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:24,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">with more than 65 colors and
at least three dimensions?</font>

82
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:27,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess someone would have to
lock you up with the crazy people.</font>

83
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good.</font>

84
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recently infiltrated a
secret Cobra dig site,</font>

85
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">code name: Greendale.</font>

86
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

87
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:41,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobra has discovered an ancient buried
structure filled with strange things.</font>

88
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

89
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah, look at that.
- It's a child's toy.</font>

90
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">The toy was more real
than this at Greendale.</font>

91
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, oof.</font>

92
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:52,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that word?
- Greendale?</font>

93
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,608
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Cobra's out to take over the
world, but G.I. Joe is there.</i></font>

94
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- G.I. Joe must be destroyed.
- Cobra hiss coming for attack!</font>

95
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,456
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's the new G.I. Joe
submachopter, piloted by Wingman.</i></font>

96
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Retreat!
- Yo, Joe!</font>

97
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are in a toy commercial!</font>

98
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hear you when
you're covered in rocks.</font>

99
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't hurt because
it isn't real.</font>

100
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good job, Wingman.
- Thank you, Duke.</font>

101
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:25,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">G.I. Joe is my entire life.</font>

102
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Joe!</font>

103
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All other figures and
vehicles sold separately.</i></font>

104
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wingman, what happened?
- I don't know.</font>

105
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He clearly has a connection
to the non-cartoon reality.</font>

106
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When I mentioned Greenda...
- Shut up. Stop saying that word.</font>

107
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:42,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're some kind of demon man, and... and
your outfit is three layers of racist.</font>

108
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, he's having an attack.
Jeff, can you hear us? It's Annie.</font>

109
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did you just call me?
- Jeffrey, do you know where you are?</font>

110
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:52,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be quiet. Leave me alone. I... I don't
belong here. I belong in G.I. Joe.</font>

111
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:55,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! And don't touch me. Who
wears a saw on their arm?</font>

112
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first time I met Destro,</font>

113
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">he asked me if he should have
his entire head coated in chrome.</font>

114
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:10,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "No. How
would you do that?"</font>

115
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would that even work?</font>

116
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm not
good at eulogies</font>

117
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,805

had to give one.</font>

how did G.I. Joe do this?</font>

other and missing for 20 years.</font>

Unbelievable.</font>

121
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Cobra Commander,</font>

122
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,502

Assistant Commander.</font>

123
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,802

energy surge at the Greendale site.</font>

124
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:35,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. That's
super fascinating.</font>

125
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:37,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Destro's dead!</font>

126
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:40,403

Were you guys close?</font>

127
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were we close? Yes!
What kind of a question is...</font>

128
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:46,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine. I loved him!</font>

129
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you
want to hear?</font>

130
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Called it.</font>

131
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are going to find
out how this happened,</font>

132
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:57,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">and G.I. Joe is
going to pay-bra!</font>

133
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:58,711

134
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,999
