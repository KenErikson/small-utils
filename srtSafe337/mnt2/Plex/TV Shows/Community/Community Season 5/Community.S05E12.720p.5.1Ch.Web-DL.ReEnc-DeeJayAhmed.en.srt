out of To-Do Stars.</font>

- It's hard to believe.</font>

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,672

turning this school around.</font>

00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,086

- Huh.</font>

00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell was that?
- What was what?</font>

8
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That long, quiet lull. I don't like it.
- It's called contentment, dude.</font>

9
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:23,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. We're never content. Someone's
always got to have a problem.</font>

10
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a problem. I don't like Abed's
problem with our lack of problems.</font>

11
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:28,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh.
- Oh. Ah, okay.</font>

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:33,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I commented on his commentary. I just
drew a circle around Abed, baby.</font>

of peace and stillness.</font>

How do you shake a story?</font>

asserted or non-asserted perturbation</font>

it's your strength.</font>

187
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about that name?</font>

188
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Ronald,
what's the damage?</font>

to estimate Greendale's liability, but</font>

193
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:50,311

200
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:19,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can start courting businesses to
unload this school on the private sector.</font>

201
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean "unload it"?
- This is a huge chunk of real estate,</font>

202
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">which generates no tax revenue and
takes money from the education budget.</font>

203
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because it's a
community college.</font>

204
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:32,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, excuse us for taking longer
to see that was the problem.</font>

205
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:36,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we're not as smart as you.
I mean, we only went to Yale.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, you didn't.</font>

207
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I did.
- Oh!</font>

208
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, we should call
T.J. Maxx right away.</font>

00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I told you.
This jacket looks fine.</font>

210
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, to talk about
selling this place.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right. Yeah, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls.
What about Ben & Jerry's?</font>

that is the last thing you need.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tough love received, bro.</font>

214
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:02,711

219
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:21,923

we saved Greendale.</font>

call the units of bread you use, "breads"?</font>

286
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- I just wish we had more time.</font>

287
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:15,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could turn things around. I swear.
Look, I got one of these label things.</font>

288
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes custom labels.</font>

289
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:23,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was gonna help
me get organized.</font>

290
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

291
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where should we start?
Should we pack up these pictures?</font>

292
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not really mine.</font>

293
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're Greendale history.</font>

294
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:36,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's our 1987
civil rights march.</font>

295
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:39,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was when we started
offering Photoshop classes.</font>

296
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's Russell
Borchert.</font>

297
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Borchert, Borchert,
loved computers"...</font>

298
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:48,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, "... more than women's butts
or hooters." Very mature, you two.</font>

299
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:52,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was there any truth
to that legend?</font>

300
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:56,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">The legend that a Greendale computer
professor made love to a computer</font>

301
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">and died of the first
computer virus? Sure.</font>

302
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:02,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, Greendale had
a computer professor.</font>

303
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:05,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, he was
a millionaire and a genius.</font>

304
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has sex with one computer,
and that's his legacy?</font>

305
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So after all my work, how
will I be remembered?</font>

306
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bald Dean with
glasses, I guess.</font>

307
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you aware there's an
engraved plate on this frame</font>

308
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">that says "The truth is
behind this picture"?</font>

309
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I'm aware, Abed.
I'm not an idiot.</font>

310
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:23,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa, wait. It meant literally?
- What is it?</font>

311
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:39,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you were teaching
Fundamentals of Law here.</font>

312
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. - Think you could make the
transition to teaching Sandwich Law?</font>

313
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:48,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's essentially the same, I'm
sure, just a bit more focused.</font>

314
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

315
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a subway black card. It
entitles you to $5 footlongs for life.</font>

316
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:59,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">For life, Mr. Winger, for life.</font>

317
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

318
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

319
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:23,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you going to do? - I'm thinking
I'm gonna transfer to City College,</font>

320
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm knowing I'm
gonna be a bartender.</font>

321
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?</font>

322
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:31,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Subway offered me a job.
- Nice.</font>

323
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:35,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm worried about Abed and Annie.
They're not ready for this to end.</font>

324
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:38,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they're part of the
adulthood-begins-at-30 generation.</font>

325
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:42,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm... I'm actually looking
forward to a little bit of...</font>

326
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sanity?
- Yes, sanity.</font>

327
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I mean, it's over, but
on the other hand, it's over.</font>

328
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

329
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:52,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to think this all started
because you wanted to...</font>

330
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nail you.</font>

331
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I regret nothing.
- Don't.</font>

332
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, after everything
that has happened here,</font>

333
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">what did either of us really get
done aside from each other?</font>

334
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:08,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly, and what are either
of us gonna be leaving with?</font>

335
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I should go clean
out my locker,</font>

336
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:21,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">she said at the age of 33.</font>

337
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get married.</font>

338
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yeah, right?</font>

339
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, this is what
matters, isn't it?</font>

340
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what keeps this all
from being pointless.</font>

341
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do what people do.</font>

342
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get a house we can't afford
and a dog that makes us angry.</font>

343
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">And dedicate an entire
cabinet to grocery bags</font>

344
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">and realize we have a
favorite brand of olive oil?</font>

345
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:45,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, marry me.
- Okay, yeah.</font>

346
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah... uh, yeah,
this feels right. Let's...</font>

347
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">get out of here and
never look back.</font>

348
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but first, let's lock these
doors and pull these shades.</font>

349
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've never had sex
on the new table.</font>

350
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, two for two.</font>

351
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:05,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Medium roughness, high tempo?
- Let's make it a number eight.</font>

352
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:11,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Buried treasure!
- Whoo!</font>

353
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buried treasure!</font>

354
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lock the doors. Close the blinds.
- We could save Greendale, Jeff.</font>

355
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:22,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">There may be
treasure on campus.</font>

356
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:25,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hidden, buried treasure.
- Treasure!</font>

357
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to call an
emergency meeting</font>

358
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">somewhere safe where no
one can hear or see,</font>

359

secret, because it's a buried...</font>

- Yeah.</font>
