00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:08,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure.
- Well, get ready to stop.</font>

4
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:13,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please help me seduce Britta now that
you've finished doing it with her.</font>

5
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, please...
- Do you even really like Britta?</font>

6
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like you like her
because she doesn't like you.</font>

7

<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you met the women
that do like me, Jeff?</font>

8

<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither have I, but trust
me, they're bad people.</font>

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

10
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get near Britta,
think like Britta.</font>

on the quad, go to the calendar page,</font>

Are you writing this down?</font>

00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we have confirmation
that all the bones</font>

19
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's a benefit show
at the Forefront Theater</font>

children with cleft palates.</font>

dressed like classic Kickpuncher.</font>

have redesigned that costume.</font>

24

sand if you want.</font>

25

<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Duncan, I didn't know
that cause interested you.</font>

26
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:08,637

with cleft palates, Britta.</font>

27
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:11,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">What part would you have
me be disinterested in?</font>

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forefront Theater?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

29
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time? I'm going.</font>

30
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm going too.
- Me too.</font>

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,325

have extra food, not less.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.</font>

33
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:24,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have...</font>

36
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,914

38
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pfft, are you really the one
that needs help here, Winger?</font>

39
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, should we write a check
to the Jeff Foundation?</font>

40
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Maybe I'll go too.
- Well, it's the least you can do.</font>

41
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, feels good to help.</font>

00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:38,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, let me tell you something.
For five years, I have watched people</font>

147
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">walk around on
your eggshells.</font>

148
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, Abed. He's so
imaginative, so magical.</font>

149
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Everybody hide
their hamburgers!</font>

150
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">"If Abed sees a hamburger,
we'll all travel in time.</font>

151
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Let's eat cookies and ice cream and dress
in pajamas in the middle of the day."</font>

152
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:55,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched my
third wife die!</font>

153
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm spoiled?</font>

154
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:03,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think I'm spoiled because it's
never occurred to anyone to do this?</font>

155
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the Marco
Polo of bullying me.</font>

156
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just another tourist taking
pictures of a great, big wall.</font>

157
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're gonna
make me cry.</font>

158
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's the last time someone
physically limited you?</font>

159
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:15,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just now. You physically
ruined my drawings.</font>

160
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drawings of what?</font>

161
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:21,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an artist?</font>

162
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I destroyed
something valuable?</font>

163
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looked like you were
doodling chickens.</font>

164
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is a duck!
- Uh-oh.</font>

165
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

166
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not allowed
in there.</font>

167
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just did a one-man show for a
little audience that would beg to disagree.</font>

168
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Audience? In there?</font>

169
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't had a single
person or performance</font>

170
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:54,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">in that theater since
the 1997 fire.</font>

171
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">24 people died.</font>

172
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what have you
guys been up to?</font>

173
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:03,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this. Raising money. Organizing.
Trying to make a difference.</font>

174
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm impressed, and
embarrassed. I sold out.</font>

175
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We sold out.
- You did not sell out.</font>

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to community
college to start a career.</font>

177
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:14,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in real estate. We own the
building we're standing in.</font>

178
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. You guys did sell out!</font>

179
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:18,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know!</font>

180
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:22,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I should introduce myself
to her friends. - I knew it!</font>

181
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a
drinking problem!</font>

182
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have feelings for Britta,
you disgusting monster!</font>

183
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:29,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Yes. Something about
everybody liking her turns me on.</font>

184
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:33,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a problem I have. I hated Reese's
pieces before E.T. ate them, sorry.</font>

185
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a bad friend!
- That's not fair!</font>

186
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, that's really not fair.
You're a terrible friend.</font>

187
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was mine first. And it's not
like she belongs to anybody.</font>

188
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here we go. "Love isn't a game,"
say the guys that always win.</font>

189
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, you're going
to go pull a Dane Cook</font>

190
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:51,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">in one of those three movies he was in
about Dane Cook getting laid by accident.</font>

191
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only it's not a Dane
Cook movie, Jeff,</font>

192
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">because this time,
someone's watching: Me.</font>

193
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend, British Jason Biggs.</font>

194
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:04,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you never call me Dane Cook
again, I'll stand down...</font>

195
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">- for an hour.
- Okay. An hour.</font>

196
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are your duck
drawings a secret?</font>

197
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:16,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you do 'em
when nobody's around?</font>

198
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that it's any
of your business,</font>

199
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I am a cartoonist
in my spare time.</font>

200
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cartoon's about a duck.
I was drawing him.</font>

201
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the duck have a name?
Does he have powers?</font>

202
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not pitching to you.</font>

203
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're afraid I won't like it.
- Sure.</font>

204
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been a cab driver,
a soldier, a cop,</font>

205
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:37,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what terrifies me the most is the
opinion of a manchild in cardboard pants.</font>

206
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:40,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kickpuncher was a cop
before he became a cyborg.</font>

207
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you were a cop before
you became... this.</font>

208
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:47,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what were you before this?</font>

209
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:51,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you normal? Or do you act like this
because somebody stuffed you in a locker?</font>

210
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that the idea?
- Other way around.</font>

211
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What else do you want to know about me?
- What makes you stop talking.</font>

212
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Letting me go.
- After you miss your movie.</font>

213
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you want
me to suffer.</font>

214
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">For destroying your
duck cartoons?</font>

215
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones you're
ashamed of?</font>

216
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:30,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, which one were
you laughing at?</font>

217
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no!
Stop that!</font>

218
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:36,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're ghosts!</font>

219
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're ghosts?</font>

220
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">The janitor out there
told me you died in 1997.</font>

221
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:42,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Janitor?</font>

222
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

223
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:48,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those guys in there told me that
you're the one that died in a fire</font>

224
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and you're a ghost!
- And you just believed 'em?</font>

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just believed a
bunch of ghosts?</font>

226
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:07,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you guys seen that billboard on
Water Street for Consensual Perfume?</font>

227
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:09,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one with the man chasing
the woman through the grass</font>

228
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it says, "Proven
in its field"?</font>

229
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, proven in its field and in
labs on the eyeballs of rabbits.</font>

230
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should make it say that!
Who's got the spray paint?</font>

231
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:21,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, guys, I'm serious!</font>

232
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:22,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doug and Janet,
you're on lookout.</font>

233
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:26,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michael works the ladder. I
will banksy that mother!</font>

234
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, we gotta
start taking risks again.</font>

235
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:32,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's convenient for
the one with nothing to lose.</font>

236
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:38,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so the person with the least
wealth has the least valid argument?</font>

237
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's convenient.</font>

238
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:44,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, how many people have you
fed this year besides yourself?</font>

239
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:44,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Janet...
- No, look.</font>

240
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent enough
time feeling bad.</font>

241
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight the power!</font>

242
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Would you like to go...
- Yeah.</font>

243
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:09,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

244
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

245
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are really good.</font>

246
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:29,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">It helps me to see why
you were so upset.</font>

247
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:31,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I ruin anything as
good as what's in here?</font>

248
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, just practice
drawings.</font>

249
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to practice drawing the
duck from different angles.</font>

250
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard when his back's
turned 3/4 because of the beak.</font>

251
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

252
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm a real jerk for wrecking it.
- Ah, you didn't do it on purpose.</font>

253
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That doesn't excuse my behavior.
- No, I appreciate that.</font>

254
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good apology.
You're a good kid.</font>

255
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Well...</font>

256
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see from the clock that
if I hit all the green lights...</font>

257
00:13:57,562 --> 00:14:00,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I can't let you go.
That'd undercut the larger lesson.</font>

258
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the lesson being that
you're very talented.</font>

259
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:04,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have this thing.
I can't walk into a movie...</font>

260
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going
to the movie.</font>

261
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.</font>

262
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You need this.
- Let me go!</font>

263
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:14,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is you learning.</font>

264
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:16,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a bad person
and a bad cartoonist.</font>

265
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go ahead.
Hurt my feelings.</font>

266
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! You have feelings, huh?</font>

267
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:21,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you considered putting
them into your work?</font>

268
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your cartoons are
monuments to joylessness,</font>

269
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:26,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">nervously assembled jokes based on
nothing from your life or anyone's life!</font>

270
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're furious at me for being creative
because you want to be able to create.</font>

271
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have all this rage and
shame and loneliness,</font>

272
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I don't even know how
to feel much less understand,</font>

273
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you decide to put
what on paper? A duck.</font>

274
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim the Duck. You think I'm crazy. You
think there's something wrong with me.</font>

275
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:40,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jim the Duck?
- Publishers are interested!</font>

276
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Yeah, well,
publishers are stupid.</font>

277
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either that or you're misinterpreting
what was probably a form letter.</font>

278
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:45,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You shut up.
- You shut up.</font>

279
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now you shut up.
- You shut up.</font>

280
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are we yelling? Are we yelling
right now? Yelling! I'm yelling!</font>

281
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yelling! I'm yelling,
I'm yelling, I'm yelling!</font>

282
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:53,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're not talented!
You made me miss my movie!</font>

283
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made me miss my movie.</font>

284
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the words of your hacky
duck, "What the hell?"</font>

285
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like music?</font>

286
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone likes music.
What are you, a fish?</font>

287
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have... Ooh, I-I tell you
what we could listen to.</font>

288
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:32,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know Rimples
and Splikket?</font>

289
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were the British
Laurel and Hardy.</font>

290
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of their stuff is timeless,
but you do need to know</font>

291
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the prime minister
went to Oxford,</font>

292
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">not Cambridge, as
the sketch implies.</font>

293
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are they speaking English?
- Okay. '80s German techno it is.</font>

294
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:53,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any friends?</font>

295
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

296
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been defining myself with reactions
to and from other people my whole life.</font>

297
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:04,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I feel worthless just because I'm
worthless in relation to my friends,</font>

298
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:06,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means they're
not my friends.</font>

299
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are your friends?</font>

300
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's my neighbor, Pat.</font>

301
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to stay on his good side.
I owe him money.</font>

302
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, Jeff. I'd call you a friend.
- Well, in fact, I'd call you a...</font>

303
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's right.</font>

304
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:20,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Jeff have actually known
each other longer than anybody, huh?</font>

305
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always forget that. I guess 'cause you
guys don't really act like friends.</font>

306
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess not so much.</font>

307
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:33,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we going?</font>

308
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think you
should go home</font>

309
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're having
an existential crisis,</font>

310
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:47,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the best lesson you
could take away from it</font>

311
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:50,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that you are someone, even
when you're by yourself.</font>

312
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're right.
Thank you.</font>

313
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">And please don't take offense at this,
but thank you for not hitting on me.</font>

314
00:16:56,868 --> 00:17:00,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just vulnerable enough
to do something really stupid.</font>

315
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing.</font>

316
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing. It's the...
the stupid steering wheel</font>

317
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">is on the wrong
side of the car.</font>

318
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- I want to show you something.</font>

319
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

320
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a script I wrote
about a cop on the edge.</font>

321
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy thought it
was hilarious.</font>

322
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have the heart to
tell him it wasn't a comedy.</font>

323
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you giving
this to me?</font>

324
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know all the tricks and
tropes of filmmaking,</font>

325
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:35,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what I'm missing is what I think
the critics call "substance,"</font>

326
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:39,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- which is you more than me.
- You want to be film partners?</font>

327
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">"It's time for Justice.
Police Justice."</font>

328
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, the character's
name is "Police Justice"?</font>

329
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I think
I may be able to help.</font>

330
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for the
stuff I said.</font>

331
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:03,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

332
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

333
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You drink scotch?</font>

334
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You're gonna.</font>

335
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, handsome.
This stool taken?</font>

336
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Struck out, huh?
- If that makes you feel better.</font>

337
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:27,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I just realized that I
was spending the whole night</font>

338
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting to third base
with the wrong person.</font>

339
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good friend,</font>

340
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't say that often enough.</font>

341
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's really nice.</font>

342
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't
have sex with me.</font>

343
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about we have
these drinks</font>

344
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then not have sex,
with anyone, together?</font>

345
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:47,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds good.</font>

346
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers.</font>

347
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a 9-millimeter's actually
better than a 10-millimeter?</font>

348
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Millimeter don't make no difference.
Bullets just kinda kill you.</font>

349
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bullets just kinda kill you."</font>

350
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you quoting something?
Can I use that?</font>

351
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. - You left your handkerchief
at my place last night.</font>

352
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah!
- We had a boys' night.</font>

353
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bottle of booze, an
argument about sports cars.</font>

354
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I cut my hand trying
to prove that I can whittle.</font>

355
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

356
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, hey. How was your night?
- Great.</font>

357
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a monumental
evening...</font>

358
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">by myself.</font>

359
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:21,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Oh... Almost feel left out.</font>

360
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've had our
share of focus lately.</font>

361
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm. Speak
for yourself.</font>

362
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:27,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

363
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine. I just, um...</font>

364
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you guys believe
in ghosts?</font>

365
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you do,</font>

366
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you believe what those ghosts
tell you about other ghosts?</font>

367
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, you cannot
be on the committee</font>

368
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're going to
be actively insane.</font>

369
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not insane. I swear.
I just, um...</font>

370
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:49,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">had a weird experience
at the theater last night.</font>

371
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were there?
- Yeah, you were there?</font>

372
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?
Of course I was.</font>

373
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:54,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, I guess we just
didn't see you.</font>

374
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the ants were people.</font>

375
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Queen Ant was
an oil company.</font>

376
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I don't exist?</font>

377
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:07,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I got this.</font>

378
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a very similar
night last night.</font>

379
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:13,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go home, light some
candles, and take a bath.</font>

380
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, coolsies.</font>

381
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:45,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! I was thinking
off-campus lunch.</font>

382
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that Tex-Mex
place you mentioned?</font>

383
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:49,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salsa Von Taco's?
Read my mind!</font>

384
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh!</font>

385
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,355

- Oh, no, no, no, no.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

387
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nah.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.</font>

388
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:00,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- No, wha... Let's...</font>

389
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:01,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No, no, no.</font>

390
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:03,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well... O-okay.
- Ah...</font>

391
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You... you just...
- Eh...</font>

392
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah. Oh, okay.
- Ah...</font>

393
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:06,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I...
- Wha...</font>

394
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I just don't like
being left behind!</font>

395

left me in my room with nothing!</font>

- Why do they do that?</font>

that Tex-Mex place.</font>
