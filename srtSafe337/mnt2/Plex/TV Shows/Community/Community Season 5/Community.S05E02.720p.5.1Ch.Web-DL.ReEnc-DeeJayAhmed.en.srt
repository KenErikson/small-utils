00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:06,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, everybody. I'm Jeff.
Uhm... Mr. Winger.</font>

2
00:00:06,294 --> 00:00:10,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is Fundamentals of Law.</font>

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, Red Hair. I'm not
gonna learn names.</font>

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will there be a syllabus?
- "Will there be a syllabus?"</font>

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is good example of a question.
Moving on.</font>

7
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ski Cap.
- How are we gonna be graded?</font>

8
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:26,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no spoilers, Ski Cap.</font>

9
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe we better do names.
- Dave.</font>

10
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What percent of our grade
will the final be?</font>

11
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, percentages,
grades, that syllabus thing...</font>

12
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we human beings or just
question-and-answer machines?</font>

13
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:42,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're students.
And you're a teacher.</font>

14
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a teacher.</font>

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see that? That
teacher just leered at me.</font>

17
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:56,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ew.
- Hey, look,</font>

18
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the star of "Head of the Ass."</font>

19
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Leonard!
Nice earring.</font>

20
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:02,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like the road manager
for the California Raisins.</font>

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! What kind of teacher
talks to a student like that?</font>

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right?
- Yeah.</font>

23
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:17,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fresh meat, huh?
- Yeah, Jeff Winger, law.</font>

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buzz Hickey, criminology.</font>

25

office, but come spring,</font>

rafters with fetal pigs.</font>

27
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be here that long. This is
sort of a temporary gig for me.</font>

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, I get it.</font>

29
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teaching to make ends meet
until a real job comes along,</font>

30
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:35,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- yeah, me too.
- Oh, cool. How long have you been...</font>

31
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:36,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">15 years.</font>

32
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">15 years and counting.</font>

80
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:06,820

professor Sean Garrity,</font>

81
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are now embarking
on an odyssey of discussion</font>

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">about an actor
who keeps the world asking:</font>

83

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicolas Cage, good or bad?</font>

84
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, young man?</font>

85
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you don't know?
- Mr. Nadir.</font>

86
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Nadir drove our
TV Studies professor</font>

87
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of his mind by proving
that there was an answer</font>

88
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the question "Who's the Boss?"</font>

89
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:29,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Angela.
- I admire your brain, Mr. Nadir.</font>

90
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:32,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not admire
Professor Sheffield,</font>

91
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:36,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I promise you, this
question has no answer.</font>

92
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:42,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your homework is to watch five Nicolas
Cage films by Wednesday, no marathons.</font>

93
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Space out your viewings.</font>

94
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five, that's it?</font>

95
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful, Abed Nadir.</font>

96
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me you will be careful.</font>

97
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea how to
make a curriculum.</font>

98
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Becoming a teacher
was a huge mistake.</font>

99
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without a doubt.</font>

100
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">That said, there
are certain perks.</font>

101
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me.
- Wow.</font>

102
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know teachers
could cut in line.</font>

103
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can actually experience this
food warm and disgusting.</font>

104
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger, what are you doing?</font>

105
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:12,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">This line is for food, not
for Lionel Richie tickets.</font>

106
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my house.</font>

107
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

108
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man's name is Mr. Winger,</font>

109
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Mr. Winger is a teacher.</font>

110
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:27,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what that means?</font>

111
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means he gets your meatballs.</font>

112
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, please.</font>

113
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all I have.</font>

114
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get outta here.</font>

115
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Place is a zoo. The trick is,</font>

116
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">you gotta show the other baboons
you got a bigger, redder ass.</font>

117
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:46,951

the new guy, Winger.</font>

120
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:58,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's having trouble
planning his curriculum.</font>

121
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

122
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:04,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's all you need to know...</font>

123
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break into groups, grade
each other's papers,</font>

124
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">and please enjoy the seven-disc
edition of Planet Earth.</font>

125
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:14,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yoo-hoo! Is there a
Mr. Winger in here?</font>

126
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, we need to carve out
some time to learn Excel.</font>

127
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you guys know Excel?
I'm learning.</font>

128
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the rules, Pelton.
Drop the checks and move on.</font>

129
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Jeffrey, I'm gonna boot up my
computer and download the tutor...</font>

130
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was that about?
- Union rules.</font>

131
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:31,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Management's not allowed
in the faculty lounge.</font>

132
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:33,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could get used to this.</font>

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicolas Cage is so weird.</font>

134
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:46,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he seemed scared to smell
that flower but happy to get shot.</font>

135
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a complex performer.
He'll give you The Rock,</font>

136
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Con Air, then Face/Off,
and you think you understand,</font>

137
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then Windtalkers, Guarding
Tess, The Wicker Man.</font>

138
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">He begs you to stop
watching, but you can't.</font>

139
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:58,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was an odd choice.</font>

140
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you say it was
odd good or odd bad?</font>

141
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's just good
in good movies</font>

142
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then acts crazy in crap
to make drug money.</font>

143
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">But is he good, or is he bad?
Every actor is something.</font>

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Downey Jr., good,
Jim Belushi, bad.</font>

145
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:11,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Van Damme, the good kind of bad,
Johnny Depp, the bad kind of good.</font>

146
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a spectrum,
and Cage is on it.</font>

147
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just have to find him.</font>

148
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:18,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna go check on Jeff.
- Oh.</font>

149
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:23,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello. - Hey, Jeff, how's
the old curriculum going?</font>

150
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:26,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. Consider our nation's
youth pre-inspired.</font>

151
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Want a refill, Winger?
- Mm.</font>

152
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that Hickey?
- Yeah.</font>

153
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're working on syllabuses.</font>

154
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:33,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, let's turd some lockers!</font>

155
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta go! Teacher thing!</font>

156
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's "syllabi."</font>

157
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guterman. Droppin' mad science?</font>

158
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, Elaine, take it easy
on the Oxford commas.</font>

159
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, walk, don't run, mister!
This isn't a racetrack!</font>

160
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:50,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, dangerous minds,
let's break into groups,</font>

161
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:53,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">discuss chapter one,
and if you are lucky,</font>

162
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:56,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">we might sneak in
a little Planet Earth.</font>

163
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

164
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

165
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a few.</font>

166
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:06,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh, she in your class, yo!</font>

167
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I guess... Uh... Just...</font>

168
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read chapter one...</font>

169
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">And memorize the federal
rules of civil procedure.</font>

170
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Class dismissed.</font>

171
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so fast, Jeff.</font>

172
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume you know why I'm
keeping you after class.</font>

173
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really. Ski Cap and White
Dave got lots of stuff wrong too.</font>

174
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the teacher, Jeff.
- You don't have to rub it in.</font>

175
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I saw today was embarrassing.</font>

176
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were late, you
clearly had no idea...</font>

177
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

178
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had no idea what
Tort Reform meant,</font>

179
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when I asked you to
explain the Sixth Amendment,</font>

180
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- you pled the Fifth!
- I know my rights.</font>

181
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.
That's the problem.</font>

182
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.
I gathered some materials.</font>

183
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:55,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow morning, before class,</font>

184
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to verify that you
know enough to teach.</font>

185
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna quiz me?
You're the worst.</font>

186
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:02,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish Troy was in my
class instead of you!</font>

187
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:03,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her, I hate her,</font>

188
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her, I hate her.</font>

189
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait, I warned you
to separate these worlds.</font>

190
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's lead, we're chalk.</font>

191
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:15,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs to be taken out.</font>

192
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:19,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of your class.
I say minus her.</font>

193
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Minus her?
- Give her A-minuses.</font>

194
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It'll drive her nuts, she'll drop.
- She'll call me on it. She'll report me.</font>

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teachers don't have to
explain minuses.</font>

196
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think
we invented 'em?</font>

197
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's my friend.
- Eh.</font>

198
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like the Leonard Meatballs?
They added something special.</font>

199
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Leonard.</font>

200
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I'm just
messing with you.</font>

201
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You done with your bit?
I'd like my earring back.</font>

202
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

203
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:52,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get your earring,
you piece of human garbage.</font>

204
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

205
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

206
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, hey,
I have a working theory,</font>

207
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">and don't react until you've
heard the whole thing.</font>

208
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you watch closely, at the
seven-minute mark in Snake Eyes,</font>

209
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll notice the moment
where an alien arm</font>

210
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">- could've come up and...
- Abed, this isn't worth it.</font>

211
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Nicolas Cage is just...
crazy.</font>

212
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">All actors are crazy, Annie.
Some crazy actors are good,</font>

213
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">some are bad, but none
of them are neither.</font>

214
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:26,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no such thing as
both, so which one is...</font>

215
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicolas Cage, huh? Oh! Oh!</font>

216
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so break into groups,</font>

217
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then, you guys
quiz each other.</font>

218
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, is that really
the best use of our time?</font>

219
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like the value
of having you here is...</font>

220
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think my value as a teacher
is to teach you how to learn.</font>

221
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're telling us
we should teach ourselves.</font>

222
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you're gonna learn
if I tell you how to think.</font>

223
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think if you tell us what you
think, then we'll learn that.</font>

224
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you should break into
groups, but you failed to learn that,</font>

225
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">so your theory's invalid.</font>

226
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:58,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, snap.</font>

227
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:01,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break into groups.</font>

228
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:04,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, how did you do that?</font>

229
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do what? - You won an
argument against Annie Edison.</font>

230
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't argue with
Annie, Garrett,</font>

231
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">you let her argue with
herself until she loses.</font>

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can win by not arguing?
- Yeah, Ski Cap.</font>

233
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:15,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone that tries to
argue has already lost,</font>

234
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they pick
an argument to lose.</font>

235
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's why
I never lost a case.</font>

236
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:22,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prosecutors beat themselves,
because they d... Here.</font>

237
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they draw a circle</font>

238
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">around something called
"The Truth,"</font>

239
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they say that everything
outside it is a lie.</font>

240
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie,</font>

241
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't cry, you were right.</font>

242
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually might enjoy teaching.</font>

243
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not crying because of you.</font>

244
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this from Professor Hickey.</font>

245
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell? He
gave you a dead rat?</font>

246
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is my witness
intimidation project.</font>

247
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave me this.</font>

248
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:53,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A-minus. - I guess I
overextended my schedule.</font>

249
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Jeff. I have
to drop your class.</font>

250
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.</font>

251
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's a genius. I mean, he
keeps getting hired for some reason,</font>

252
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's not because
of his hair.</font>

253
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, if I was in
70 films over 30 years,</font>

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I spent each one
talking at random volumes,</font>

255
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might accidentally
win an Oscar.</font>

256
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think our opinions about
pop culture are fed to us</font>

257
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:18,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- by machines designed to criminalize
human autonomy. - Good one.</font>

258
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God.</font>

259
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- No, stand back.</font>

260
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him space.</font>

261
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicolas Cage, good or bad.</font>

262
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">A challenge, certainly,
but not unsolvable,</font>

263
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">because all actors have distinct
values, which I use to find answers.</font>

264
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, how much Nicolas
Cage did you...</font>

265
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

266
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched enough to find...
the answers.</font>

267
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because this...
this is my reality,</font>

268
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is how I learned to be, and my
being doesn't allow for Nicolas...</font>

269
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:59,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freaking Cage, okay?</font>

270
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah!</font>

271
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Oh! Oh!</font>

272
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm a cat.
I'm a sexy cat.</font>

273
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh! Oh!</font>

274
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:24,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">O-o-ohh!</font>

275
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:37,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed? Think of something safe like
Holly Hunter, or Don Cheadle!</font>

276
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed? Abed!</font>

277
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was brilliant.</font>

278
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave Annie an A-minus?</font>

279
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you? What
were you thinking?</font>

280
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you drawing a peanut?
- It's a duck,</font>

281
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's none of your
concern, actually.</font>

282
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to cartoon?</font>

283
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying and succeeding.
State your business.</font>

284
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:03,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know what kind of monster
minuses the best student in his class.</font>

285
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:04,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a monster?</font>

286
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in the storm drain lair
of the Black River Ripper.</font>

287
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:11,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen human heads used
for things other than heads,</font>

288
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">so best not be calling
me a monster.</font>

289
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you're a bad teacher.</font>

290
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I got her off your back.
- I was handling it.</font>

291
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike you, I know how
to engage my students.</font>

292
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I may not love teaching, but
I did fool around with it today,</font>

293
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I may hook up with it again
a few more times</font>

294
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if I do dump it
right before Christmas.</font>

295
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We do not work for them.
- Maybe we do.</font>

296
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">That does not count
as an argument.</font>

297
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, drawing ducks
doesn't count as cartooning!</font>

298
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one duck, his name is Jim,
and publishers are interested!</font>

299
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Edison, good news.</font>

300
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to Professor Hickey and it
turns out your project was an "A."</font>

301
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used your connections
to change my grade?</font>

302
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:51,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, an A-minus means
you actually earned an "A,"</font>

303
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the teacher doesn't like you.</font>

304
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a secret faculty thing.
- What?</font>

305
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you kidding?
- Et tu, Brute?</font>

306
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I using that right?</font>

307
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:01,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been busting my
butt for five years,</font>

308
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:05,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the whole thing comes down to a
few old losers' petty insecurities?</font>

309
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oligarchy!
- Et tu, Brute!</font>

310
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've got to tell people!
- Mm.</font>

311
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minuses are made up!</font>

312
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's riot time! Yeah!</font>

313
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! Bring me their heads!</font>

314
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop pop!</font>

315
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:35,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed? I couldn't find you
at school, so I got worried.</font>

316
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're throwing away all
your little movies, why?</font>

317
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have no value anymore.</font>

318
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you're looking for
something to believe in,</font>

319
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:46,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a skinny, little Hebrew
handyman you could meet.</font>

320
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:50,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to become Christian,
Shirley, or a better Muslim.</font>

321
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was my religion.</font>

322
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the meaning of
people was somewhere in here.</font>

323
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I looked inside Nicolas
Cage and I found a secret.</font>

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are random and pointless.</font>

325
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in my religion,
the whole point</font>

326
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:02,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that you can't understand
every little thing,</font>

327
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know, there's a word
for people who remind you</font>

328
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're not God, and invite
you to try a little harder.</font>

329
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prophets, messiahs,
kung fu pandas.</font>

330
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:12,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So Nicolas Cage is Jesus?
- Uh, no,</font>

331
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he clearly works
in mysterious ways,</font>

332
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maybe that's just his job.</font>

333
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why critics can
call him a genius or an idiot</font>

334
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">and be right no matter what.</font>

335
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:24,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">A demon to some and an angel
to others, like a cenobite.</font>

336
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, did you say cenobite?</font>

337
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know, cenobite,
like from Hellraiser.</font>

338
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like Hellraiser? You
know the word "Hellraiser"?</font>

339
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought pinhead in space was a bit
of a letdown, but I'm in for the ride.</font>

340
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise up, Greendale!</font>

341
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your teachers have
been lying to you!</font>

342
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:46,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserve slightly
higher grades!</font>

343
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!</font>

344
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world is watching this!</font>

345
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Oh, wait.</font>

346
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out of data minutes.</font>

347
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:58,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world will be watching
this on the first of next month!</font>

348
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!</font>

349
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeffrey, do something!
- Slightly higher grades.</font>

350
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Distract them.
Take your shirt off!</font>

351
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:07,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here.
- Slightly higher grades!</font>

352
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:11,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Slightly higher grades!
- Everybody, calm down! Just listen!</font>

353
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think the students
and teachers at Harvard</font>

354
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:18,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">are at each other's throats?
No, because they're all rich.</font>

355
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have something
in common too.</font>

356
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all suck.</font>

357
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all broke.</font>

358
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all just went
through an entire week</font>

359
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">of meatball lunches
without even blinking.</font>

360
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:31,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's on me.</font>

361
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I converted the lunch menu
to a spreadsheet.</font>

362
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The teachers here
are teachers here</font>

363
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they did something
wrong, same as the students.</font>

364
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:45,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">So get on the same team,
because, take it from me,</font>

365
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:50,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">those of us that get to leave
aren't going anywhere.</font>

366
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Boo!
- No, you suck!</font>

367
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:56,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

368
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, go with my
"take off your shirt" plan!</font>

369
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I point out that you're
doing this together?</font>

370
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all based on rows
and columns of cells.</font>

371
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's why
the call it "Excel."</font>

372
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't care.
- Mm-kay,</font>

373
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">now, I know it's unrealistic to think
that we can eliminate riots completely,</font>

374
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have been
crunching the numbers,</font>

375
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I believe we can
reduce them by 40%.</font>

376
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:20,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's hope the man doesn't target
you for dreaming this big.</font>

377
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's my plan.</font>

378
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that "Save Greendale"
committee you pretended to form?</font>

379
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need one of those for real.</font>

380
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:30,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a student/teacher
alliance, with you in charge.</font>

381
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I vote myself out.
- You don't have a quorum.</font>

382
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't forget, if I fire you, you're
likely starve and die, so you know.</font>

383
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me
to cut your meatball?</font>

384
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look,</font>

385
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">there are two things
I don't do well,</font>

386
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:49,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">apologies and
drawing duck bills.</font>

387
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost perspective.
Students aren't the enemy,</font>

388
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:55,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, I don't know, maybe
my bills are a little pointy.</font>

389
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm basing them on beaks.</font>

390
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Apologize to Annie.
- I did, I gave her an "A."</font>

391
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how else
to make it right.</font>

392
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I guess, I don't
know, I quit.</font>

393
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a better idea.</font>

394
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:17,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">As our first order of business for the
student/teacher Save Greendale Committee,</font>

395
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:21,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">we hereby ban the Dean from
attending future meetings.</font>

396
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Our second order of business...</font>

397
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lunch.
- Yeah.</font>

398
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taste-testing rations
for the shelter I'm digging.</font>

399
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you the coolest
person in the world?</font>

400
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt it.</font>

401
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to address
the fact that there are</font>

402
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">no Asian-Americans
represented here.</font>

403
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can get Chang.</font>

404
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need to rush into anything,
I just wanted to address it.</font>

405
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody want some nuts?</font>

406
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:24,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quiet, I think he's just coming.
- This is gonna be hilarious.</font>

407
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, pharmacy please.</font>

408
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is Buzz Hickey.</font>

409
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:44,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you gave me the wrong
medication. I usually get Lipitor.</font>

410
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,898

won't cover it anymore?</font>

411
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:51,304

to the generic stuff.</font>

412
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you a question, lady,
can you pay out of pocket?</font>

413
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an educator, ma'am,
living on a teacher's salary!</font>

414
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I-I'm sorry.
What's your name?</font>

you something, Leia,</font>

I'll call back later.</font>

419

say this as fast as I can.</font>
