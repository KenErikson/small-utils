00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:05,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">The urinals in the women's restroom
will be turned into planters.</font>

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Onto chores.</font>

4
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:10,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need some able bodies to clear out a
space in the east hall's storage room.</font>

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:11,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll do it.
- Really?</font>

6
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:13,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Annie always goes from the
easy chores to the hardest.</font>

7
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true, isn't it?</font>

8
00:00:14,926 --> 00:00:16,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll do it too.
- Yeah, me too.</font>

9
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that concludes this meeting.</font>

10
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Aw, man!</font>

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody picks up on my patterns!
What am I gonna say next?</font>

12
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Graham cracker!
You didn't know.</font>

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,307

18
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:35,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was between a Thighmaster and
a Dick Tracy Burger King glass.</font>

19
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Happy anniversary.
- Anniversary?</font>

20
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I should learn
your name, young lady.</font>

21
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:40,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Rachel.</font>

22
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel. Nice to
meet you, Rachel.</font>

23
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can go.
- Okay.</font>

24
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aww!
- Anniversary?</font>

25
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Rachel and I have been
dating for one of your months,</font>

26
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">but our relationship is
12 times more efficient,</font>

27
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">so it's really been a year. Our
sleep cycles are in synch,</font>

28
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:55,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can communicate
with our eyebrows,</font>

29
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she knows my Netflix password...
Jeff's Netflix password.</font>

30
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:58,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it. I'm changing that.</font>

31
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I changed it.
- To what?</font>

32
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try. Annie, can Rachel come
to our place to play this tonight?</font>

33
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't afford to
take her anywhere.</font>

34
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:06,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my brother's in town
for the week,</font>

35
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm broke too, so I was
gonna make him dinner tonight.</font>

36
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:09,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Double date?</font>

37
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dinner and 1993

38
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,763

- Salmon.</font>

39
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Buttered noodles.
- Buttered noodles are my favorite.</font>

40
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Ah!</font>

they'll really go missing.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna sit on 'em
until we know they're cold.</font>

144
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we're gonna price them
through a third party,</font>

145
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna unload
them in a single score.</font>

146
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of that nickel-and-dime crap.
I don't wanna leave a trail.</font>

147
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, great.
- Wonderful.</font>

148
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:41,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's count
these babies up.</font>

149
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:42,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, great.</font>

150
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we were kids, Anthony and
I would play Time Machine.</font>

151
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:50,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">We would go, "Oh, no!
We're in Barbarian times!</font>

152
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick! Back to the Time Machine!"</font>

153
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we would run
back to the Time Machine.</font>

154
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true.</font>

155
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:03,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet that's why Abed is like a
brother to me. You guys are so alike.</font>

156
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't accept that based
on one time-machine story.</font>

157
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel, did you tell Annie
about your Waterpik?</font>

158
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose now is as
good a time as any.</font>

159
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:14,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I own a Waterpik.
- Annie has one too.</font>

160
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys both care for your
teeth the same amount.</font>

161
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you shared a bathroom,
it'd go pretty smoothly.</font>

162
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anthony said he could
fix our cabinets.</font>

163
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel used to mop floors when she
worked at Kmart. She mops good.</font>

164
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:24,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a real conversation or
are we being bugged by the feds?</font>

165
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

166
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sidebar.</font>

167
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think
happens after you die?</font>

168
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- You're lucky.</font>

169
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop trying to sell me on Rachel.
- Stop pitching Anthony so hard.</font>

170
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like ice cream cake
out there... overkill.</font>

171
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a roommate.
We're broke.</font>

172
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I vote for Rachel.
- I vote for Anthony.</font>

173
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Flip a coin? - No. Coins
create parallel timelines.</font>

174
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:51,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rock, paper, scissors?
- That's a nine-sided coin.</font>

175
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Pile
of Bullets?</font>

176
00:07:54,494 --> 00:08:00,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna decide on a roommate with
a 1993 Old West-themed VCR game?</font>

177
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Rachel or I win,
Rachel moves in.</font>

178
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you or Anthony win,
I'll politely surrender</font>

179
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">and count down the days
until he eats me.</font>

180
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, it's settled.</font>

181
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this working?
- It's a handshake in progress.</font>

182
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to play
Pile of Bullets?</font>

183
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not me.
- You have to.</font>

184
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:18,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, it's okay, we don't have to.
- It's not okay. We do have to.</font>

185
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have to, and one
day we'll tell you why.</font>

186
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for now, let's simply
retire to the TV area.</font>

187
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:26,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the highest stakes 1993 interactive VCR
game of your entire young adult lives.</font>

188
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's see
what you got.</font>

189
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Okay.</font>

190
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know somebody
that knows people.</font>

191
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:48,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get you a price per book,
find a buyer, and make a deal.</font>

192
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For half.
- That's ridiculous.</font>

193
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assuming more
than half the risk.</font>

194
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Half is fair.
- Not really.</font>

195
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:58,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they're ours, all 100% of them.
Giving you half is not fair, it's silly.</font>

196
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, good luck. You
wanna re-blindfold me?</font>

197
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we're in E-9
in the east wing.</font>

198
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that because
it smells like weed.</font>

199
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my weed.</font>

200
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:11,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm willing
to give her half.</font>

201
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:13,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear that, Britta? You can
have half of Jeff's share.</font>

202
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what I meant.</font>

203
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you're offering
by giving her half of the total.</font>

204
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either she can get half of all of our
money or she can get half of your share.</font>

205
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, you walk
away with about 16%.</font>

206
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's not fair.
- Damn right.</font>

207
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what is: 25%
for each of us.</font>

208
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it or leave it, Britta.</font>

213
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if something sketchy
is happening, I don't care.</font>

214
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,716

out of the room now and...</font>

00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:48,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

217
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,653

did not see anything!</font>

218

- I've got rope.</font>

I'm just gonna leave quietly.</font>

285
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,980

287
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- What the hell? Ow!</font>

288
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you leave until
we're done with this deal.</font>

wants you to be doing today!</font>

to think about that.</font>

ton of bricks. Right, Hickey?</font>

292
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:04,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, definitely.</font>

293
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,235

isn't getting insane.</font>

00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm gonna give
you some space.</font>

334

- What?</font>

00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want one of you
to live with us.</font>

338
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're settling it with
a game of Pile of Bullets.</font>

339
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:46,283

this side of you,</font>

uncomfortable.</font>

how girlfriends work,</font>

have one anymore.</font>

wants to see a sample, set a price,</font>

do the exchange.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But she knows one
thing for sure:</font>

353
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:33,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be right back with it so
you can divvy it up, even Steven.</font>

00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, that is rich.</font>

355
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's supposed to stop her
from robbing you guys blind?</font>

356
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna
do, call the cops?</font>

357
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go with her.
- Oh, yeah. Good plan.</font>

358
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:46,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, leave Hickey here, and
the two of you do the deal.</font>

359
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what the hell? When did I
volunteer for Guantanamo duty</font>

360
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:54,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you two traipse off to the
Cuban equivalent of Las Vegas?</font>

361
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:58,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Havana, right? - Guys, don't listen
to Jeff. He's just trying to divide us.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Says the woman who's willing to
take care of the cash by herself.</font>

363
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if you're
Mr. Trustworthy.</font>

364
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:05,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have so
much access to rope?</font>

365
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you're the one who left the door
unlocked so Chang could get in here.</font>

366
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know you didn't
do that on purpose?</font>

367
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys. Guys! Calm down.</font>

368
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we can work this out. We just
need to stay cool and talk it through.</font>

369
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:22,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. That didn't work
out the way I planned.</font>

370
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. But you didn't
leave me any choice.</font>

371
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were acting very poorly, I didn't
know if I could trust you anymore!</font>

372
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dragged me into this.</font>

373
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want this.</font>

374
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

375
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're packing?
- Yeah.</font>

376
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:43,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're leaving?
- Yeah.</font>

377
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because of last night?
- Yeah.</font>

378
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:48,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think there's some
unresolved issues here.</font>

379
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

380
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:55,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still really hurt by mom turning
her back on me when I went to rehab.</font>

381
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I guess part of me was mad
at you for siding with her,</font>

382
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:04,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I thought you moving in here
was some kind of moral victory.</font>

383
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

384
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:08,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean unresolved issues involving the
black guy in all these photographs.</font>

385
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy? - Hey, I don't
know his name, man.</font>

386
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just know he's clearly
left some kind of vacuum.</font>

387
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">And screw you. What did
I have to do with mom?</font>

388
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 13.</font>

389
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:25,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hi.</font>

390
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to do my
third-act apology.</font>

391
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:28,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, I don't think...
- Wait.</font>

392
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't reject it until the
whole thing's been served up.</font>

393
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobry.</font>

394
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:35,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your locker please.</font>

395
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

396
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wanna tell you something.
- Abed, this is adorable.</font>

397
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:50,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because it's adorable
doesn't mean it's not important.</font>

398
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

399
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been accelerating
our relationship</font>

400
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I've been worried I
wouldn't pass a lot of the tests.</font>

401
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:57,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted you to move in
because I thought</font>

402
00:17:57,941 --> 00:18:00,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Annie was around, I'd have
less chance of screwing things up.</font>

403
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:02,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not screwing
things up, though.</font>

404
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good to know.</font>

405
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the problem with me will always
be that I can never know for sure.</font>

406
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a huge amount of people
in my life that haven't eventually</font>

407
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:13,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">kicked me out, and I don't
always see it coming.</font>

408
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:16,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want it to
happen with you.</font>

409
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't manipulate me and don't keep
secrets from me and we'll probably be okay.</font>

410
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

411
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stopped raining.</font>

412
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it sure did.</font>

413
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww, you hired a
stunt person.</font>

414
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:35,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I did not.</font>

415
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you get these?</font>

416
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were an inheritance
from my father.</font>

417
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was a collector.
- Mmhmm.</font>

418
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:47,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many?
- 120.</font>

419
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, for the whole bunch,
maybe 20.</font>

420
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thousand?
- Dollars.</font>

421

<font color="#FFFFFF">- $20,000?
- 20 non-thousand dollars.</font>

422
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">20 regular dollars. You might get
that from a recycling place.</font>

423
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:59,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are misprints, honey.
Check out page 105.</font>

424
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:00,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't because
there's no page numbers.</font>
