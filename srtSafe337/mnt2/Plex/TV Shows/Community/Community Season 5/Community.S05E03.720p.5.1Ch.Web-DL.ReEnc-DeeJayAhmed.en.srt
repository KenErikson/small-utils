147
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hurts.</font>

148
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, ooh, LA LA. Hickey,
what have you got?</font>

149
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heartburn. It doesn't
help me catch criminals.</font>

150
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:51,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I didn't want to
take drastic measures,</font>

151
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've cooked up
a little something.</font>

152
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:54,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang?</font>

153
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:59,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better put a quarter
in that crack, Mr. Bandit.</font>

154
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor hickey.</font>

155
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font>

156
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hah!</font>

157
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gotcha!
- Whoa! Ha, what do you think?</font>

158
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:18,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this is spending too much money
on a crime that nets you 25¢ a pop.</font>

159
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, no, no.
This was free.</font>

160
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:23,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I think you just admitted
you already owned a fake butt.</font>

161
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I am the mad hatter,
if hats were butts.</font>

162
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I am neither left nor right.
I am the space between.</font>

163
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To me, you're all like ants</font>

164
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:35,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">marching to class,
freaks on parade."</font>

165
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, why mix metaphors?
Ants don't have butts.</font>

166
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

167
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ants do have butts.
- No.</font>

168
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are Dave lyrics.</font>

169
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dave?
- Dave Matthews.</font>

170
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard-core fans
call him Dave.</font>

171
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:50,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, excuse me for being
alive in the '90s</font>

172
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:52,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">and having two ears
connected to a heart.</font>

173
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so all we need to
do is assemble a list</font>

174
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">of which Greendale teachers
are Dave Matthews fans.</font>

175
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we better get to work.</font>

176
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Done.
- Oh.</font>

177
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought that would take longer.</font>

178
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:17,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">So please approve the Dean's new
security measure called "Troy's law,"</font>

179
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">because a camera
in the bathroom...</font>

180
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is better than a
quarter in your butt.</font>

181
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:29,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">As we've seen, the Ass Crack Bandit can
be defeated by using the three "B's:</font>

182
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Belts, briefs, and buddies.
Good.</font>

183
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:37,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bandit always gets his
victims when they're alone.</font>

184
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bend over with friends over.</font>

185
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's safety in numbers.</font>

186
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:44,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got cracked!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">He's under the bleachers!</font>

188
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone remain calm, please!</font>

189
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, free-for-all!</font>

190
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Where you been?</font>

191
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I questioned Guterman.
We can cross him off.</font>

192
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the time of the first cracking, he was
chaperoning Greendale's science dance.</font>

193
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">The student that attended
can vouch for him.</font>

194
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked out Mrs. Plimpton.</font>

195
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Airtight alibi.
She's dead.</font>

196

- Mmm!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">This extra long churro tastes
good in my real mouth.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nom nom nom nom nom.</font>

201
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I help you?</font>

202
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:28,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to ask you a few
questions if that's okay.</font>

203
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's bolting!</font>

204
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's there!</font>

205
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're going to confiscate
this, know one thing.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mild, kind sativa,
perfect for playing guitar.</font>

207
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:55,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been another...</font>

208
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">what the hell?</font>

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroying classrooms?</font>

210
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:05,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secretly investigating
teachers behind my back?</font>

211
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has to
investigate the faculty,</font>

212
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:10,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're like a single-celled
organism... no nerve.</font>

213
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:12,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, you're suspended.</font>

214
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:16,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, you can't do that!
- Don't tell me what I can't do.</font>

215
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think you
are, Cosmo's July quiz?</font>

216
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She was trying to help you.
- Let me ask you two something.</font>

217
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me be, like, the 50th person at
this school to ask, what is this, huh?</font>

218
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is this creepy business?
- What?</font>

219
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you two like to
partner up on cutesy capers</font>

220
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:35,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can hold
hands in the dark</font>

221
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">and address your urges
in semi-acceptable scenarios.</font>

222
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:40,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, not cool!</font>

223
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:43,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You not cool!
You unprofessional!</font>

224
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm punishing you, Jeffrey.</font>

225
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:48,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting next week, you are the
new coach of the water polo team.</font>

226
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- That's right.</font>

227
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:52,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every morning, in the water...</font>

228
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig Pelton, Dean and
assistant water polo coach.</font>

230
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

231
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Ass Crack Bandit.</font>

232
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh...
- I find it funny</font>

233
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you ever thought
you could catch me.</font>

234
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's very interesting.
Please continue.</font>

235
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've enjoyed
our game of cat and mouse.</font>

236
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's funny how close your two
little helpers came to catching me.</font>

237
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I liked watching them
run in circles.</font>

238
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although sometimes I wonder,</font>

239
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:16,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">are they chasing me as an
excuse to get near each other?</font>

240
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, get a room already.
- We're friends!</font>

241
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you tell us where
you are, and we'll discuss it?</font>

242
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:25,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the bringer of change.
I am the filler of cracks.</font>

243
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's very interesting.
I myself was in 4h.</font>

244
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

245
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trace the call, Rhonda!</font>

246
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">This means trace the call!</font>

247
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the extension.</font>

248
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">594. Okay.</font>

249
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tracing...</font>

250
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tracing.</font>

251
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it, the stables!
We have stables?</font>

252
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

253
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Creepy.
- I don't know.</font>

254
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:58,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add some doilies and a foot bath,
and this is my mom's house.</font>

255
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mush! Mush!</font>

256
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mush! Yah! Mush!</font>

257
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, run. Mush! Mush!</font>

258
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:17,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starburns?</font>

259
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since faking his death
to escape meth charges,</font>

260
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alex "Starburns" Osbourne
has been living in the stables,</font>

261
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:30,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">eating garbage, and trying
to build a cat car.</font>

262
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's also confessed
to dropping coins</font>

263
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:36,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">down exposed butt cracks.
Case closed.</font>

264
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:40,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- High five?
- Sure.</font>

265
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:42,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Oh, American high five. Sorry.</font>

266
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:44,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

267
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Ooh!</font>

268
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:05,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much pain.</font>

269
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now it's time to heal!</font>

270
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all invited
to the official</font>

271
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:13,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">"we caught the Ass Crack Bandit"
dance tonight in the cafeteria!</font>

272
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff!</font>

273
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way
Starburns did it.</font>

274
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Innocent people don't confess.
- Are you kidding me?</font>

275
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew it was a teacher.
You know that doesn't add up.</font>

276
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I was wrong.</font>

277
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:32,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe the Dean
was right about us.</font>

278
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

279
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:36,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I took this case
because I wanted to help you.</font>

280
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what is this?</font>

281
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's platonic shoulder holding.</font>

282
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:41,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

283
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, hello, how are you?</font>

284
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:50,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a guy who puts quarters
down butt cracks, Jeff.</font>

285
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:53,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just let it go.</font>

286
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can do better.</font>

287
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Change is money!</font>

288
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys,
millionaires?</font>

289
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:13,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">T-shirts here! Cracked
but not broken, huh?</font>

290
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's in?
T-shirts!</font>

291
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">T-shirts here!
20 bucks.</font>

292
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:22,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Duncan?
- Yeah?</font>

293
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not going to the dance?

I should give you this ad...</font>

You don't know who this is?</font>

I made a deal with the Dean.</font>

307

<font color="#FFFFFF">He said as long as I confessed, he'd
let me slide on the meth stuff,</font>

308
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:05,424

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but why call the
Dean and pretend that...</font>

00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,790

Do you see him?</font>

00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Over there!
- Come on, let's get him!</font>

338
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking for you.</font>

heart attack faker</font>

346
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce had been recently banned from
campus, but not from our hearts.</font>

347
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's survived by many ex-wives</font>

348
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,951

that called him friend.</font>

00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:32,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're listening, Pierce, you
were a hell of a d&d player.</font>

350
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:33,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to level up.</font>

351
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,076

is Dr. Farts.</font>

353
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:47,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is weird.</font>

for all this little stuff,</font>

356
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you get caught up in it.</font>

357
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:54,861

Haven't slept.</font>
