we'll have another dinner,</font>

15

34
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:28,650

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rope, Tingles, Cat
Woman, Steve.</font>

149
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, keep it floppy.</font>

150
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haul it, ball it, never call it.</font>

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Girls are objects.
- Yeah!</font>

152
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two MeowMeowBeenz.</font>

153
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

154
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed was just explaining
that the Fives get to choose</font>

155
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:11,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- what setting the air
conditioning is on. - Yep.</font>

156
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it me, or are more
people wearing gray.</font>

157
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I'm in a commercial, and
someone's about to hand me a Starburst.</font>

158
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Threes and Twos tend to
wear neutral colors.</font>

159
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking like you want to move
up can get you moved down.</font>

160
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:24,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, hey. Come here.
- Hi.</font>

161
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are other Threes.</font>

162
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talk about how we're
glad we're not Twos.</font>

163
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:31,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small talk, guys.</font>

164
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make small talk now.</font>

165
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeffrey.</font>

166
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you decided to join
MeowMeowBeenz.</font>

167
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:38,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's a great
tool for living.</font>

168
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:40,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You look great.
- You look great.</font>

169
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:42,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what you're doing.
- You know what you're doing.</font>

170
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm watching you, okay?</font>

171
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm, mm.
- Mm, mm.</font>

172
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:50,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you'll be watching
my hinder, mama,</font>

173
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:53,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">and choking on its billowing
plume of highly rated dust.</font>

174
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:12,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Fours and above only.</font>

175
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are snacks
for the Fives.</font>

176
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? You're a two.</font>

177
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, would you rather a
Three serve the Fives food?</font>

178
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

179
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is no secret that
the Threes and Twos</font>

180
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:30,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">are growing suspicious
of the Fours and Fives.</font>

181
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that
it's my birthday.</font>

182
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:38,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we give these people
something to believe in again?</font>

183
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Koogler? - Hey. I know what
you guys think of me, okay?</font>

184
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, it's Koogler."
You know. "He's cool."</font>

185
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:47,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He likes to get laid.
He's not that old."</font>

186
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm a Five because I know what
the Twos and the Threes need.</font>

187
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we all need?</font>

188
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entertainment.</font>

189
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">A talent show.</font>

190
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">An event where Threes and
Twos can rise and fall.</font>

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">It helps people believe
in the system.</font>

192
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give my spot to someone else.
I don't want to be a Five.</font>

193
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:04,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was happy as a Three.
I'm miserable.</font>

194
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear Abed.</font>

195
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:08,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">So humble.</font>

196
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You people are monsters.</font>

197
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if there's
nothing else, then...</font>

198
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak.</font>

199
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headline items... A few Twos
broke into a supply closet</font>

200
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stole a box
of peanut butter.</font>

201
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">The futurization of the campus
decor is almost complete.</font>

202
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a few hours ago, Jeff
Winger became a Four.</font>

203
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

204
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">You there, girl.</font>

205
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:44,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many MeowMeowBeenz?</font>

206
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two!</font>

207
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two? Are you lost, Two?</font>

208
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:52,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Are you lost, Two?</font>

209
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll escort her to
the common area.</font>

210
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:57,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Four?
I don't recognize you.</font>

211
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's new Beenz.</font>

212
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye, new Beenz.</font>

213

7:00 is Fours only.</i></font>

215
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- How goes the revolution?</font>

216
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:12,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't break a Four.</font>

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's impossible to get any higher
without half the Fives in your corner.</font>

218
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They got this thing locked up.
- Yeah, but they're nervous.</font>

219
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:20,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're hosting a talent show to
prove that anyone can be a Five.</font>

220
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:23,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you enter it, you'll be center
stage with all eyes on you,</font>

this isn't democracy.</font>

222
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is tyranny.</font>

223
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Can you
put some mustard...</font>

224
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have to put mustard on
my face for this to make sense.</font>

225
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:36,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know we have to
take this system down.</font>

233
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Jeffrey, I beg you
not to take this risk.</font>

234
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what they say. Fives
have lives, Fours have chores,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Threes have fleas,
Twos have blues,</font>

I'm from hallway "C."</font>

257
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to get to the cafeteria
before they run out of apples!</font>

258
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is with
Twos and apples?</font>

259
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're given three
kinds of fruit.</font>

260
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mix it up.</font>

261
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you become a Four.</font>

262
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you get that, uh...
that Four walk.</font>

263
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm
talking about? It's like this.</font>

264
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like one of these.</font>

265
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they got a little trail
of Twos behind them,</font>

266
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:03,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're like "Hey, is
there an apple up there?"</font>

267
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">There came a time</font>

to be a Three?</font>

273
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:25,950

00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, Fives,</font>

296
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:58,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the inaugural
fancy future dance.</font>

297
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:12,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you don't think making Jeff a
Five was a mistake like everybody else.</font>

298
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe in taking risks.</font>

299
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:16,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Jeff's really cool.</font>

300
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't help but
notice that Shirley</font>

301
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:21,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't clap with the rest of you
after my performance.</font>

302
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she always
so different?</font>

303
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you talk to me, I can't
concentrate on the dance moves.</font>

304
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe the
rumors, do you, Koogler,</font>

305
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Jeff manipulated
his way to the top?</font>

306
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I can hear
what you're saying.</font>

307
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to manipulate someone
into thinking I'm manipulative.</font>

308
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.</font>

309
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one ever knows what
you're talking about</font>

310
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you never
say what you mean.</font>

311
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:42,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to have
this conversation,</font>

312
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">or do you want to just keep flexing your
veiny arms and throwing out apples?</font>

313
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,306
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tranquility is advancement.</i></font>

314

315
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:55,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twos and Threes, you're accepting
a life you don't have to live!</font>

316
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand up for yourselves!</font>

317
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

318
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, fine.</font>

319
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me that.
- Hey!</font>

320
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all alive!</font>

321
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:16,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are all alive!</font>

322
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:21,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the mustard on my
face, but listen to my words.</font>

323
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one of the angriest,
most vindictive...</font>

324
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the angry one, because the
rules got changed on you, Winger.</font>

325
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just be cool
and be in charge now.</font>

326
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you have to gossip
and give out food</font>

327
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:31,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and make people feel guilty.
- Okay, yeah.</font>

328
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:35,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bust my ass making a world full
of selfish idiots remember my name!</font>

329
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:38,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Call it hard work, but don't tell
me the system measures who's nice.</font>

330
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it kind of does.</font>

331
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security, banish them to the
Outlands with the rest of the Ones!</font>

332
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:51,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, no!
- Ow!</font>

333
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, okay, okay.
- No! No!</font>

334
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:58,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
tray tables in their party positions...</font>

335
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:01,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sayeth Captain Koogler.</font>

336
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:04,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, keep the tray tables
where they are, Koogler.</font>

337
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rule of the Fives is over!</font>

338
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long live the review-lution!</font>

339
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- That comes down?</font>

340
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, okay, all right, all right.
- Whoa!</font>

341
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Happy?
- Are you happy?</font>

342
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:30,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I knew you couldn't
go to that stupid dinner.</font>

343
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's why I didn't invite you.
- It's nice to be invited anyway.</font>

344
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure, if you're a control freak.
- Oh, and you clearly hate control.</font>

345
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

346
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it.</font>

347
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it's easy to pretend
that you don't when you got it.</font>

348
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think we'd
be better friends</font>

349
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:52,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're both such big
fans of the same thing.</font>

350
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">You there! Ones!</font>

351
00:17:54,484 --> 00:18:01,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are permitted back indoors by
decree of Britta, the mother of Ones.</font>

352
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do I hear correctly
that as a Five,</font>

353
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">you felt you could park
in handicap spots?</font>

354
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you see, that's just
part of the Koogler style.</font>

355
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:13,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's human crap style.</font>

356
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rate him!</font>

357
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, that's low.</font>

358
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:27,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Fives must be cleansed of their
Five filth and reduced to oneness.</font>

359
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff. Hey, Shirley.</font>

360
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a Five anymore. I'm a one like
everyone else. I'm like everyone else.</font>

361
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's next?</font>

362
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, time to pull the plug.
- Mm.</font>

363

365
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:45,951

us that has not been cleansed.</font>

369
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,871

00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,544

from judgment.</font>

Five that's unregistered?</font>

382
