00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived in New York.</font>

148
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Miss Perry, climb aboard.
It's fake killing time.</font>

149
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Shirley Island.</font>

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">No furniture beyond this point.</font>

151
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave your weapons at the door
and any spare doors at the entrance.</font>

152
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then came the
now-now times...</font>

153
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:35,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the floors were covered
with the burny touch.</font>

154
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

155
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You made it.
- Friends!</font>

156
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Shirley Island, where
all your dreams come true,</font>

157
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you dream of standing on
a table and pissing in a jar.</font>

158
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:48,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Britta?</font>

159
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:51,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She didn't make it.
- Oh, that's too bad.</font>

160
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:54,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Poor Britta.
- It's okay.</font>

161
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her sacrifice got us this
far, and now we can't lose.</font>

162
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

163
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because now we're
on Shirley Island,</font>

164
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">and according to legend...</font>

165
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:02,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">so is the orb.</font>

166
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I have no idea
what you're speaking of.</font>

167
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a place of peace.
- And profit.</font>

168
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come again?
- You're not really playing, Shirley.</font>

169
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a merchant, and
more power to you.</font>

170
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't withhold power from
others just to make money.</font>

171
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We want the orb.
- Abed.</font>

172
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm still a little raw from
what happened with Britta back there.</font>

173
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, fun is fun, but</font>

174
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want my last day here to
be a day where everyone hates me.</font>

175
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last day?</font>

176
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,981
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Citizens of Shirley Island!</i></font>

177
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you
brought to my door?</font>

178
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back!</font>

179
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My God, it's Hickey.
- Aah!</font>

180
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's got chair walkers!</font>

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come out with your
feet on the floor,</font>

182
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there will be no need
for nudging or jostling.</font>

183
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:56,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not skip my son's
birthday for second place!</font>

184
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to say something to
you guys about mental health.</font>

185
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:09,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that Britta? Is she alive?
- Why did you think she was dead?</font>

186
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We kind of...</font>

187
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- l-left her.
- Left her for dead?</font>

188
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds bad when you
put it that way.</font>

189
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you put it a way
that sounds good?</font>

190
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do realize this isn't
just a pile of chairs, right?</font>

191
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:24,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a crib, and you're curled up
inside there, sucking your thumb,</font>

192
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:26,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're too
scared to say good-bye.</font>

193
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's time to grow up.</font>

194
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:31,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">The adults are here, and we're
gonna tear down your fort.</font>

195
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:34,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chair walkers, attack! Ah-ooh!</font>

196
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:37,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah-ooh!</font>

197
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:50,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name was Vicki!
Tell my story!</font>

198
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:52,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my only pants!
I can't get them dirty!</font>

199
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm actually British!</font>

200
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leonard! Butter 'em up!
- You got it!</font>

201
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:12,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cirque du so long, you
high-stepping acro-bastards!</font>

202
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you have any rolling chairs?
- Behind the curtain.</font>

203
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abandon fort! Women
and man-children first!</font>

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, seat feet!</font>

205
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chair to dance?</font>

206
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

207
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

208
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I'm your friend.</font>

209
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hear dead
people, Annie.</font>

210
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm in a world of imagination.
- Ha!</font>

211
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then imagine what the
floor looks like.</font>

212
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have to. I'll just imagine
where you're about to be!</font>

213
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the same as
imagining the floor.</font>

214
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you just admitted
that's where you'll be.</font>

215
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Knock, knock, Britta.
- I'm not gonna say "Who's there?"</font>

216
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">because someone on the
floor is knocking.</font>

217
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's lame. You
have to say, "Who's there?"</font>

218
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Floor!
- What?</font>

219
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:59,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's who's there!
- Yeah!</font>

220
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's for you!</font>

221
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Aah!</font>

222
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, give us the orb, and
we can save Shirley Island.</font>

223
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:12,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">The orb can't save Shirley island
because Shirley Island is the orb.</font>

224
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a cool way like Keyser Soze or a
lame way like Jewel of the Nile?</font>

225
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell Buzz Hickey that
Shirley Bennett said...</font>

226
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't want
to waste your time.</font>

227
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just think of something
cool and give me credit.</font>

228
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the door I'm knocking
on is your home,</font>

229
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if I'm the floor,
it means you're dead.</font>

230
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're the floor,
you're already dead.</font>

231
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do it right!
Knock, knock!</font>

232
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock, knock!</font>

233
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Who's there, bitch?</font>

234
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floor!</font>

235
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floor!</font>

236
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

237
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

238
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed in a bubble ♪</font>

239
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:24,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! Hickey, you chicken.</font>

240
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gutted us. Retreat!</font>

241
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:36,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

242
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

243
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the only one left.</font>

244
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:44,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won 50,000 bucks.</font>

245
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 50,000
lottery tickets!</font>

246
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't outrun
your emotions!</font>

247
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

248
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! I had a dream like
this, but it was sexual.</font>

249
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:11,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will force you two to grieve
properly even if it kills us all!</font>

250
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away, Britta!</font>

251
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:14,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Aah!</font>

252
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:22,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yay!
- Ow!</font>

253
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yay! Ow!
- Ow!</font>

254
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about our
butts touching.</font>

255
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we'll go
into the vents.</font>

256
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They'll never find us there.
- I say we take a stand here.</font>

257
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, someone's got
to win sometime.</font>

258
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if we never kill each other.
Then we can play forever.</font>

259
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Wait.</font>

260
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, the floor can't
be lava forever.</font>

261
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game's got to end.</font>

262
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a game for me, Troy.</font>

263
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm seeing real lava
because you're leaving.</font>

264
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's embarrassing, and I don't want
to be crazy, but I am crazy, so...</font>

265
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a game that made you and
everyone else see what I see.</font>

266
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:09,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want it to be there either, I
swear. I want you to be able to leave,</font>

267
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't think the lava goes
away until you stop leaving.</font>

268
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:15,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the only way I can help you
is by giving up my chance to...</font>

269
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">be one person?</font>

270
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys ready for closure?
- Of your caskets?</font>

271
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:28,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, stop, okay? The
lava's real to Abed.</font>

272
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:29,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not a game to him.
- Oh, no.</font>

273
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:30,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think?</font>

274
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:33,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's used to
getting his own way.</font>

275
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's never met me.</font>

276
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- No!</font>

277
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:42,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

278
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

279
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh!</font>

280
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

281
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">When this game is over,
I'm gonna shove you back.</font>

282
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, give me
your other hand!</font>

283
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's down to us. You or
Britta will be the winner.</font>

284
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not leaving, okay?
Just... I promise.</font>

285
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... the floor's not lava now.
Just give me your hand.</font>

286
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think the lava's
here because you're leaving.</font>

287
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's here
because I won't let go.</font>

288
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:11,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

289
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye.
- Abed.</font>

290
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:15,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed. Abed!</font>

291
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,159

304
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:53,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one gets Abed.</font>

305
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got him a little.</font>

306
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my fault.</font>

307
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:02,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't deserve to fake live.</font>

308

00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,048

- How?</font>

310
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:09,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I don't know. In real life, I
don't know, but I can fake fix him.</font>

311
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:10,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I can clone him.</font>

312
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll clone him.
- Go on.</font>

313
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need his DNA.</font>

314
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get his DNA.
Don't touch the lava.</font>

315
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be onto something.</font>

316
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:23,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna find discarded technology
from this once great civilization</font>

317
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:25,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and start a cloning machine.
- Mm!</font>

318
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:28,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm placing this
cellular regeneration</font>

325
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,375

a perfect clone of Abed.</font>

326
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:07,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, Britta's
work was sloppy.</font>

327
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not an exact replication.</font>

328
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have all of Abed's
abilities and memories,</font>

329
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:12,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm missing his
wild emotionality.</font>

330
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although I think I may be
able to let Troy go now.</font>

00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:22,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

332
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't been
completely honest.</font>

333
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:27,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really scared
to go on my trip.</font>

334
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you don't have to go.</font>

335
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your clone can.</font>

336
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

337
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:04,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you guys are all
cloned up too, huh?</font>

338
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, believe in cloning.</font>

339
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:08,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,</font>

340
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:11,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">guess that's my ride.</font>

341
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so excited for you.</font>

342
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna see the world
and experience new cultures.</font>

343
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, technically all
culture has been homogenized</font>

344
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">by 50 years of
American imperialism,</font>

347
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost Britta'd our good-bye,
huh? I'm the worst.</font>

348
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the best,
and I love you.</font>

349
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm better at sex
than Jeff, right?</font>

350
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:37,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've yet to have
anyone worse.</font>

351
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I ever wanted
in high school was</font>

352
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:45,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Troy Barnes
to notice me,</font>

353
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:47,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I ended up
living with you.</font>

354
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:50,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm pretty lucky.
- I'm not.</font>

355
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a chance to be your
friend in high school,</font>

356
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was too busy
trying to be cool.</font>

357
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:56,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed out on four
more years of Annie.</font>

358
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

359
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the coolest
guy I know.</font>

360
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I make you proud.</font>

361
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never stepped foot
outside of Colorado.</font>

362
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,490

than me by doing this.</font>

old mom in your college study group.</font>

fortress.</font>

you, I had to patch</font>

370

with genes from a homing pigeon.</font>

like a compulsion to come back.</font>

this thing all on your own?</font>
