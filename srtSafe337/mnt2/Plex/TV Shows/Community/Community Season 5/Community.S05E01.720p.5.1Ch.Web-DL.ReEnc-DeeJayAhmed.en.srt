00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ooh.
That was his thesis.</font>

148
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay! So sue me!</font>

149
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.</font>

150
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, my job is to give a certain
number of degrees per year,</font>

151
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we could get shut down.</font>

152
00:06:58,076 --> 00:06:59,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that would be bad because...</font>

153
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, because then I
wouldn't have a job.</font>

154
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, you know, Greendale is a
good place for good people.</font>

155
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:06,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">That whole spiel, huh?</font>

156
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

157
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:10,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">That whole spiel.</font>

158
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wingblade.
Shock me by impressing me.</font>

159
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He shredded Humphries.
- What?</font>

160
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you! How could
you let this happen?</font>

161
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I have to ask you to
leave the concierge desk.</font>

162
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:29,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, this case was all I had.
I am screwed!</font>

163
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife left.
My girlfriend dumped me.</font>

164
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're sisters, so now
the whole family's pissed.</font>

165
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:37,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. Bring me all the paperwork
for filing a class action.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Letters of intent, engagement,
everything. Multiple copies.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger, you just lost our client!</font>

168
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
But I can create five new ones.</font>

169
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so dusty. Let's get
this off the table.</font>

170
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's the Winger guarantee.</font>

171
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:58,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, maybe we should bring
strong fundraising ideas...</font>

172
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That aren't bake sales...
- Hey.</font>

173
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,776

in cages and the animals come to visit.</font>

175
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay, Jeff? You
left kind of freaked out.</font>

176
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

177
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,259

this school might be in trouble</font>

178
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of this
bridge-collapsing guy.</font>

179
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:15,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the one making bad bridges.</font>

180
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like me blaming owls for
how much I suck at analogies.</font>

181
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:22,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a student
will claim, in court,</font>

182

<font color="#FFFFFF">that their school ruined their life,</font>

183

185
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Make it litigation-proof.
- How?</font>

186
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think like the enemy.</font>

187
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did Greendale
damage you, Annie?</font>

188
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't. I love
hospital administration.</font>

189
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:39,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that your job?
- Well...</font>

190
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">not yet.</font>

191
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:44,440

things to hospitals,</font>

the cure for fibromyalgia.</font>

That's ironic.</font>

197
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">I push pens, Britta.</font>

198
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,051

the therapy market?</font>

203
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is basically like
a modern-day therapist.</font>

murder, I can't tell anyone.</font>

bad at bartending.</font>

293
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chang?
- Kevin?</font>

294
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:08,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang. I've dropped the amnesia thing,
copped to my crimes, and went to jail.</font>

295
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:09,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm on work release.</font>

296
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:11,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Working as what?
- Math teacher.</font>

297
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next, explain the pajamas.</font>

298
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm on work release from house
arrest, but I don't have a home.</font>

299
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:19,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">See this? This won't let me
travel 100 yards from this,</font>

300
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,817

a 30-yard cord,</font>

301
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can only travel...</font>

302
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever. You do the math.</font>

303
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:29,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said you teach math.
- Exactly. I teach it. You do it.</font>

304
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang was faking his Changnesia?</font>

305
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">They seriously rehired a teacher they
fired for trying to burn down the school?</font>

306
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">After being rehired as a security guard</font>

307
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">after being fired
for impersonating a teacher.</font>

308

309
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worse than insane.
Irresponsible.</font>

310
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Evil.
- I don't believe in evil.</font>

311
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this school clearly got
a finger up its butt as a child.</font>

312
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place ruins lives.</font>

313
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that were true,</font>

314
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:59,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">then what could we
possibly do about it?</font>

315
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,746

old legal Nemesis doing here?</font>

317

318
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:14,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we were partners again</font>

319
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I lost my usefulness.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be evil,</font>

321
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">but your friend here is
so much more dangerous.</font>

322
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell 'em how it
took you 30 minutes</font>

323
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:27,580

to sue their own school.</font>

324
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:31,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it.</font>

325
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

326
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,884

to pick up these pieces.</font>

327

328

<font color="#FFFFFF">My dealer's a gym teacher here.</font>

329
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were lying to us?</font>

330
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never lied to you.</font>

331
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I showed you the right truth.</font>

332
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:59,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, when we met, you
were an eclectic anarchist.</font>

333
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you become
the group's airhead?</font>

334
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:02,464

the Unstoppable Go-getter?</font>

341
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there was that
gas leak last year.</font>

342
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:23,892

on the gas leak year.</font>

343
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:25,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a four-year process.</font>

344
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:27,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">We went in one end
as real people</font>

345
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">and out the other end
as mixed-up cartoons.</font>

- Sure.</font>

347

how many psychotic breaks on campus?</font>

with a chance to be something,</font>

350

taken away from you.</font>

357
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

358
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,789

make some money.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Jeff, if this is what
you really want to do.</font>

364
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:17,801

- With lies.</font>

371

above lying, remember?</font>

372
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,221

<font color="#FFFFFF">A crappy place, sure,</font>

394
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:57,643

Do you want to do another take?</font>
