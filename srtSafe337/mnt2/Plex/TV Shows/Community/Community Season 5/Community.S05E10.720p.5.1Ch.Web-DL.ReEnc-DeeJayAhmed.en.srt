to put on the radar: Insurance.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about it?
- School needs some.</font>

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can ask on the street.
- What?</font>

4
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, too cool for street insurance?
Must be nice.</font>

5

<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister wants to know what I'm
bringing to my grandson's birthday.</font>

collage situation.</font>

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't invited.
My son had a kid three years ago.</font>

8

<font color="#FFFFFF">I barely get to see him
on major holidays.</font>

9

who in the hell does he think he is?</font>

10
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:28,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You saw your son at his wedding.
- No, that's Furio, my gay son. Him, I get.</font>

11

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hank's a knob,
doesn't have any hobbies, interests.</font>

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he does is play... What do you call
that crap with dungeons and dragons?</font>

13
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:37,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Dungeons and Dragons"?
- That's the crap.</font>

14
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know that game.
- We play "Dungeons and Dragons."</font>

15
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:45,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, let's play "D&D"
to help Hickey reconnect with his son.</font>

16

<font color="#FFFFFF">Was everyone's takeaway last time that
we use "D&D" to reprogram brains?</font>

17
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:50,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that we almost caused a suicide?</font>

18
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:55,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">We prevented one.
Fa... bulous Neil felt like a nobody.</font>

19
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thanks to us, he's still out there,
doing this and that in the background.</font>

of "Dungeons and Dragons"...</font>

24

and his son tomorrow night?</font>

25
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye!</font>

26
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:18,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay. It's short notice,
but I think it'll be good for me.</font>

27
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:31,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Dad...</font>

28
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just curious.</font>

29
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:34,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it
about "Dungeons and Dragons"...</font>

30
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">that suddenly leapt out at you
at age 60?</font>

31
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dungeons. It'd be the dungeons.</font>

32
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:42,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin.</font>

33
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:46,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blood orange sunrise crests
the peaks of Rage Mountain...</font>

34
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">as you arrive
at the troubled Galindor.</font>

35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahead to the north, a bridged ravine.</font>

36
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beyond that, a mysterious black tower
where, rumour has it...</font>

37
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:56,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">an evil necromancer dwells.</font>

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your goal: Reach the top
and destroy the necromancer...</font>

39

<font color="#FFFFFF">freeing the realm from his evil magic.</font>

40
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:04,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's just what I love
about role-playing games...</font>

41
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">is being told exactly what to do.</font>

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me too.
- You should introduce yourselves.</font>

43
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am...</font>

44
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy. Joseph Gordon Diehard.
Really?</font>

45
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of Sir Riggs Diehard.</font>

46
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:20,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm Sir Riggs Diehard, so I guess
I'm your dad in the game too.</font>

47
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God, so cool.
- Isn't that weird?</font>

48
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:25,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy. Guys, I don't suppose...</font>

49
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is some contrived
paint-by-numbers adventure...</font>

50
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's designed to force
an emotional bond...</font>

51
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:34,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">between me and my emotionally
stunted father, is it?</font>

52
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No way, Jose.
- What?</font>

53
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:41,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got an idea. Why don't we just
sort of reshuffle all these...</font>

54
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">redistribute them.
Yeah, just mix them up a bit.</font>

55
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:45,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think...</font>

56
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here we go.</font>

57
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, everyone.
I am Tristram Steelheart.</font>

and the rest is gibberish.</font>

61
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Crouton, the half-orc Druid.
Druid?</font>

62
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Crouton.</font>

63
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hector the Well-Endowed? Again?</font>

64
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's a weird coincidence?
I'm a troll named Dingleberry.</font>

65
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my mom's nickname for me.</font>

66
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm who Hickey was,
Sir Riggs Diehard.</font>

67

<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the bond between father and son."</font>

74
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you guys like to do?</font>

75
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should cross the bridge
and head for the black tower. Huzzah?</font>

76
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huzzah?
- Huzzah.</font>

77

across the bridge.</font>

78
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else is out there?
What's south or east or west?</font>

79
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about it, Aziz?</font>

80
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I walk too far south,
do I fall off your graph paper there?</font>

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can head south.</font>

82
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've generated some details
about the surrounding area.</font>

83
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, for God's sakes, Hank,
it's been five seconds.</font>

84

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you not do this?
- Hey, you tell me.</font>

85
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we losing?</font>

86
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:17,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It's not a competition.
The only winner is fun.</font>

87
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're having fun.</font>

88
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go to Tristram, and I'm laughing...</font>

89
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I pick him up,
and I carry him to the bridge. It's fun.</font>

90
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hector is trying to lift you.</font>

91
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cast "Torvin's Flesh of Fire."</font>

miscalculated the bridge strength?</font>

- Oh, no.</font>

108

112
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:28,639

party because I wanted to enjoy it.</font>

00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:34,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, fathers and sons,
there is a lot of power between them.</font>

114

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Stop it.</font>

115

This was just awesome.</font>

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, wait, wait.
I'll play your dragon game with you.</font>

128
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:14,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let's make it interesting.
If I kill the necrophile before you do...</font>

129
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come to my grandson's birthday.
We'll settle it like men.</font>

that play this.</font>

131

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

132
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:27,863

before you do...</font>

or Thanksgiving at Aunt Rachel's.</font>

you guys can help me beat him...</font>

and oversized codpiece.</font>

145
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:20,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can make some s'mores out of
horse meat and s'more horse meat.</font>

146
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Build a fire? Horse s'mores?
Screw this.</font>

147
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The river runs east. I head west.
- Tiny Nuggins scampers into the jungle.</font>

148
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:31,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I didn't scamper in the jungles
of Nicaragua and I won't do it now.</font>

149
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, come back. I follow him.
- Me too.</font>

150
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:36,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiny Nuggins, if we rest,
we'll regain our strength.</font>

151
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">And lose my family.</font>

152
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:41,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll imaginary sleep
when I'm imaginary dead.</font>

153
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the distance,
you notice a patrol of hobgoblins.</font>

154
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hobgoblins?
- Larger, stronger, and worth more...</font>

155
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... in Scrabble than regular goblins.
- Get down.</font>

156
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I punch him in the heart
and I keep running.</font>

157
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:55,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no women with them,
are there? I got class.</font>

158
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You charge,
alerting them to your presence.</font>

159
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You attack the nearest one
in the chest.</font>

160
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You miss and fall down.
- What?</font>

161
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hobgoblins are heading toward
Nuggins with spears.</font>

162
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:06,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. I cast "Entangle" on them.</font>

163
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crouton the Druid waves her arms...</font>

164
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:12,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">causing grass, vines and branches
to entangle the limbs of...</font>

165
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four hobgoblins.</font>

166
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two free hobgoblins fire arrows
at Crouton.</font>

167
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">One pierces her shoulder.</font>

168
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other her chest.</font>

169
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fire an arrow at them.</font>

170
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit.</font>

171
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hobgoblins don't like their odds.
They bolt into the jungle.</font>

172
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you better run.</font>

173
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:35,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go find a name that's not just
another creature's name plus "hob."</font>

174
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crouton?
- I'm here.</font>

175
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:43,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was badly wounded
from her fall in the Skull River...</font>

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the arrows were just too much.
I'm sorry.</font>

177
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it? Is she dead?</font>

178
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that's it, Hickey.</font>

179
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dead.</font>

180
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's okay.</font>

181
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on your side.</font>

182
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I'm dead.</font>

183
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I may be gone...</font>

184
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:02,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">but just remember whenever
the wind whispers through the woods...</font>

185
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got me killed.</font>

186
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you listen to me, young man.</font>

187
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've punched about a thousand hearts
in my life.</font>

188
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I never, never missed.
- You ever been a 3-foot tall half ling...</font>

189
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:22,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">running through 2-foot high vines
trying to punch a 7-foot monster?</font>

190
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna check the others.
Check your character.</font>

191
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:28,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or just kind of generally take this game
seriously. Your son does.</font>

192
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take a moment of silence
to mourn my fallen comrade, Crouton...</font>

193
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:37,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">before rifling through her belongings.</font>

194
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father?
- No way to know where the others are.</font>

195
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still travelling north
along narrow cliff edges...</font>

196
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Hawthorne Mountains.
I'll roll for encounters.</font>

197
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to cast a healing spell
on Fibrosis.</font>

198
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

199
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not gonna help you
kick your dad out of your life.</font>

200
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
this competition is healthy.</font>

201
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think what you did back there
was cool.</font>

202
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm the bad guy because
I didn't invite him to my son's birthday.</font>

203
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know where he was...</font>

204
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">for most of my birthdays?</font>

205
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little place that rhymes
with "not there."</font>

206
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Times Square?</font>

207
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear an ominous screeching.</font>

208
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:21,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving upward into view, three huge,
white arachnids with eagle wings.</font>

209
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:22,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sky Spiders.</font>

210
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I draw my sword, and I cry out,
"Back, eight-legged demons!</font>

211
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not scoop you up with a catalogue
and let you outside on this day!"</font>

212
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay your blade, Joseph Gordon.</font>

213
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sky Spiders are as frightened of us
as we are of them.</font>

214
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, they eat all the sky mosquitoes.</font>

215
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cast "Speak with Monsters,"
and I say:</font>

216
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:47,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hello. You're looking well."</font>

217
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lead spider bends four knees
and twitches its hairy ovipositor...</font>

218

<font color="#FFFFFF">rhythmically secreting
and retracting a giant droplet...</font>

219
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or drop... of silk.</font>

220
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fibrosis, as a ranger...</font>

221
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">you recognise this as the arachnid
signal of submission.</font>

222
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice work, Tristram.</font>

223
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, you made that Sky Spider
your bitch, yo!</font>

224
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've tracked the hobgoblins
to this shack.</font>

225
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">One guard hob-guards.
What they call guarding.</font>

226
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go.
- Sniper arrow on the guard.</font>

227
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:17,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strikes true. Guard drops.</font>

228
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I move to the doorway, detect traps.
- None detected.</font>

229
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:22,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I enter.
- Left flank.</font>

230
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right!
- One, facing east.</font>

231
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Backstab.
- Double damage.</font>

232
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.
Footsteps behind the door to the north.</font>

233
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I notch two arrows.</font>

234
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Climb the walls, get above the door.
- Goblins enter from the north.</font>

235
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I fire.
- Both arrows hit.</font>

236
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cleave!
- You kill one and wound another.</font>

237
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drop on the last one and grapple.</font>

238
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got a hold of him.
- This one is for Crouton.</font>

239
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">With his dying breath, he utters:</font>

240
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The dark lord will kill you all."</font>

241
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, these things can talk?</font>

242
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want two taken alive.</font>

243
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna try something.</font>

244
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

245
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Tiny Nuggins.</font>

246
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna put my dagger down
right here, so we can just talk.</font>

247
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:00,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human trash.</font>

248
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look,
I'm gonna give it to you straight.</font>

249
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a necromancer.</font>

250
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need two goblins to find him.</font>

251
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">So between you and your friend,
who do you think's the most useful?</font>

252
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, your friend sure can talk.</font>

253
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liar. He'll never turn.</font>

254
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah,
because of that famous goblin loyalty.</font>

255
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never drive a wedge
between you and some guy from work.</font>

256
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was best man at that guy's wedding.</font>

257
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend says you just got married.</font>

258
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.
Too bad about the food.</font>

259
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope your flesh rots in... Wait.</font>

260
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the food?</font>

261
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I guess he didn't like
your wedding toast.</font>

262
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Golbak said that?</font>

263
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Klang doesn't approve of you and Lisa,
Golbak...</font>

264
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't get the sense
it's because of his feelings for you.</font>

265
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:49,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think about Lisa, sitting in that hole
in Darktooth Canyon...</font>

266
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:54,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">with that little Frimrok and Grignog
rolling about on the wolf pelts.</font>

267
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, between you and me,
which one do you think is yours?</font>

268
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

269
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where the tower is.</font>

270
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sky Spiders have flown you
as far as their complex religion allows.</font>

271
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">They set you down and express,
through intricate prancing...</font>

272
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... directions to the tower.
- Yes.</font>

273
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, forgive me.</font>

274
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have travelled so far from you.</font>

275
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many game days
since the Skull River ripped us apart?</font>

276
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many real hours
since I've gone pee?</font>

277
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">We seek this necromancer.</font>

278
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Why?</font>

279
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:53,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our reasons are dreams,
our dreams, dust.</font>

280
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I send word on wings of sparrows...</font>

281
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">in hopes they might find you.</font>

282
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed says the odds
are near impossible.</font>

283
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough for me.</font>

284
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:13,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should you receive this message,
I know of a way to reunite.</font>

285
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to my character sheet...</font>

286
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:18,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I rub the blade of our magic
family sword while you rub the hilt...</font>

287
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">twin beacons of light
will reveal our locations to each other.</font>

288
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each night,
I will think of you and rub...</font>

00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">praying for the night
fate will find us rubbing together.</font>

290
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your son, Joseph Gordon Diehard.</font>

291
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something strange has happened.</font>

292
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:46,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sparrow lands
on Riggs Diehard's shoulder.</font>

293
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:48,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It carries a note.</font>

294
00:14:57,238 --> 00:15:00,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Abed, I rub my sword's hilt"?</font>

295
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beam of light shoots up
from your location...</font>

296
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">as the hilt of Diehard
seeks its blade.</font>

297
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beam arcs and meets an equal
beam in the woods to the north.</font>

298
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that where the others are?</font>

299
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, 10 miles away, same as you.</font>

300
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll be arriving at the tower...</font>

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the same time tomorrow morning.</font>

302
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">This began as a race.</font>

303
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it may end in war.</font>

304
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody have a toothpick?</font>

305
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a piece of popcorn
stuck in my tooth.</font>

306
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, right under the gum.
I've been trying like for 15 minutes...</font>

307
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:32,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">with, you know, my tooth
and then with my tongue and my finger.</font>

308
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm always one tooth off,
and I just can't seem to...</font>

309
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello, there we go. Anyway...</font>

310
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it may end in war.</font>

311
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe after all we've been through...</font>

312
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">we should just call this thing off.</font>

313
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:55,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you think that's up to us?</font>

314
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen the way he talks to me,
doesn't want his father in his life.</font>

315
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll do anything to win,
and that includes attacking you.</font>

316
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you best believe
that your little friends in there...</font>

317
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">are drinking up his Kool-Aid.</font>

318
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:10,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a man who thinks
of grandchildren like trophies.</font>

319
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why he'll play to win.</font>

320
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why I can't let him.</font>

321
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise, brave, sweet Dingleberry.</font>

322
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise.</font>

323
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:30,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both parties have arrived
at the black tower.</font>

324
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, guys.</font>

325
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Father.
- Joseph Gordon.</font>

326
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are here so Tristram Steelheart,
Lord of the Sky Spiders...</font>

327
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:44,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">can slay the necromancer. You cool
or are we gonna have to get red?</font>

328
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiny Nuggins, Waterboarder of Goblins,
will do the slaying...</font>

329
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">because every man has the right
to hang out with his grandson.</font>

330
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:52,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too bad you're outnumbered.</font>

331
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they're not.</font>

332
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not part of this.</font>

333
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Joseph Gordon Diehard...</font>

334
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am only here to hug my father,
which I now do.</font>

335
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a trick!</font>

336
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not letting him hug me.
- I hug my father!</font>

337
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He has gunpowder in his pants.
- I draw my sword. Stay back!</font>

338
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I draw an arrow.
- So do I!</font>

339
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troll sound!</font>

340
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lower your sword?
- No!</font>

341
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean, are you...?
- I hug my father!</font>

342
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're impaled.</font>

343
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worth it.</font>

344
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:34,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord.</font>

345
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son slayer!</font>

346
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I attack Jeff!
- Arrow at Chang!</font>

347
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Arrow at Annie!
- I head for the door.</font>

348
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do I!</font>

349
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Taste the blade of Diehard!
- I run!</font>

350
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Turn a snake into a rope!
- Two arrows!</font>

351
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:48,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Spear, spear!
- I take the kid, pop him.</font>

352
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three damage.
- Lightning bolt, lightning bolt!</font>

353
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heal our moderate wounds!</font>

354
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:57,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I spray all over them.
- I hold Britta's face in a puddle.</font>

355
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seven damage.
- Cleave, cleave, cleave!</font>

356
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:04,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I fire two arrows.
- I drink from the Chalice of Knowing.</font>

357
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dingleberry smash!</font>

358
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:11,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Plus three, demonic eye look.
- Pull and shove it up them!</font>

359
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that,
I put one right behind the ear.</font>

360
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fire two...</font>

361
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Riggs, hand in character sheet.</font>

362
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Top floor, one door.
- I open it.</font>

363
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Flame Strike."
- You did already.</font>

364
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mace!
- Okay. Missed.</font>

365
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hit him with a throwing dagger.
- Used all your knives.</font>

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Will one of you guys take care...?</font>

367
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:41,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? You're all dead? I keep going.
- I follow.</font>

368
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've reached
the necromancer's workshop.</font>

369
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see his bed, bottles of goop,
some necromancing crap...</font>

370
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">but no necromancer.</font>

371
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I search. Can I search
or are you gonna stab me in the back?</font>

372
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I am a thief, not a wuss.
I search too.</font>

373
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find a secret door.
It's easy, already open.</font>

374
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">It leads to a ladder which goes
straight down to another open door...</font>

375
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... on the back of the tower.
- Man. Way to go.</font>

376
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great. He just got away.</font>

377
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you can't just say he's gone.
You owe us an ending.</font>

378
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:11,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you nothing.</font>

379
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a Dungeon Master.</font>

380
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:15,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I create a boundless world,
and I bind it by rules.</font>

381
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too heavy for a bridge? It breaks.</font>

382
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get hit? Take damage. Spend an hour
outside someone's front door...</font>

383
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting over who gets to kill him?
He leaves through the back.</font>

384
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:27,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out there. You might find him,
if you get your crap together.</font>

385
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.
Take it from a bunch of ghosts.</font>

386
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no kind of life.</font>

387
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need fresh air and frozen yogurt.</font>

388
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on me. Hug it out.</font>

389
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gag me.
- Who even uses that phrase?</font>

390
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm climbing down the ladder.</font>

391
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna find this guy.
- I stay and search the workshop.</font>

392
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any stuff there that can heal me?
- Some potions.</font>

393
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, I get half of that.</font>

394
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just went down the ladder.</font>

395
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can...
Can I hear him looting upstairs?</font>

396
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if I move about silently.</font>

397
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, fine. If I heal you,
can we divide the potions?</font>

398
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but I decide who gets what.</font>

399
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, but we've gotta be wary of traps.</font>

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wand of Orcus.
- I don't...</font>

401
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:04,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

402
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:09,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me a... I'm up to here with you.
- Want to get the necromancer or not?</font>

403
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do they like each other now?</font>

404
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me? They can't stand
being in the same room.</font>

405
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also don't think
they can handle being apart.</font>

406
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:23,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think they just found a way
to avoid doing either.</font>

407
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:30,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's the best
most fathers and sons can do.</font>

408
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've made me so proud today.</font>

409
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Know where we can buy a real sword?
- Oh, Jeffrey.</font>

410
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still at the entrance
to the Chamber of Grief.</font>

411
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your move, Mr. Tickles.</font>

412
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You successfully pour more tea
into Count Frogula's cup.</font>

413
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">That puts it at Hillary Rodham Kitten.</font>

414
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you attempt to pass crumpets.</font>

415
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:09,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fail.</font>

416
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:13,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting frustrated. If you take a look
at your inventories, you'll see...</font>

417
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are you almost done?</font>

418
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep without my stuffies.</font>

419
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Hold on.</font>

420
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a goblin notices you
and murders you all. You're dead.</font>

421
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all yours.</font>
