<font color="#FFFFFF">As for my collection

00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some one-armed guy with a scar
on his face dropped it off.</font>

16

<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was
Star-Burns' lawyer.</font>

Tell me when to stop.</font>

- You guys!</font>

- Yeah. The blu-ray shelf.</font>

27
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:18,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-Burns also left me
his ashes.</font>

28
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">He requested they be burnt.</font>

29
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:20,701

how ashes work.</font>

00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,257

and do celebrity impressions?</font>

33
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,623

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, was a drug dealer.</font>

243

<font color="#FFFFFF">And stole them...</font>

252
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,696

253
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,037

00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,871

some protection, right?</font>

256
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,812

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are.</font>

297
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:00,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...
We're worse students.</font>

298
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you tried to save
Greendale,</font>

299
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">we trashed the school
like a TV commercial</font>

300
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the teacher
banned skittles.</font>

301
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:08,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's sweet of you
to say, Jeffrey.</font>

302
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:11,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't change the fact
that we're all Ted Danson</font>

303
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">at Whoopie Goldberg's roast.</font>

304
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we all back
each other up to the board</font>

305
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">and explain the we were
all experiencing</font>

306
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:20,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">"funeral crazies"?</font>

307
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:23,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say that's a thing
because I'm a psych major.</font>

308
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:26,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, they're still
going to need a fall guy.</font>

309
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about the crazy man who...</font>

310
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:33,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">commanded a bunch of preteens
to spray poison in our faces?</font>

311
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

312
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was right under our noses,
wasn't it?</font>

313
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Group hug...</font>

314
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:42,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I'm between
Jeff and Troy.</font>

315
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go... oop, you're
walking away from the hug.</font>

316
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there, Ben.</font>

317
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind scooching
from my desk?</font>

318
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got some testimony
to get prepared</font>

319
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:59,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the school board
meeting tomorrowsies.</font>

320
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">That testimony wouldn't
happen to involve</font>

321
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">pinning the riot on me.</font>

322
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:06,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, I'm sorry,
but this has gone too far.</font>

323
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I regret issuing those
extraordinary powers to you.</font>

324
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I regret letting this child army
get out of hand.</font>

325
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I regret giving you that
unasked for adult back rub</font>

326
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:15,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you were asleep that once.</font>

327
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're gonna
have to let you go.</font>

328
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nuh-uh, ain't happening.</font>

329
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always knew this
day would come.</font>

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the only person getting
replaced around here is you.</font>

331
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, it's me.</font>

332
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:34,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! I will...</font>

333
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:38,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">The single worst wake riot
this district has ever seen.</font>

334
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we've seen our share.</font>

335
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tables, chairs, floors,
ceilings, all affected.</font>

336
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:50,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">A campus already in mourning
is pushed into chaos.</font>

337
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sitting here facing me now,</font>

338
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:54,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">the so-called
Greendale Seven...</font>

339
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reportedly responsible
for inciting</font>

340
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:58,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">the entire chain of events.</font>

341
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is some
pretty serious stuff.</font>

342
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:10,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir... Although my friends and I
behaved somewhat irresponsibly,</font>

343
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">we shouldn't forget about
the circumstances on campus.</font>

344
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had just lost a classmate.</font>

345
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:22,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a lizard...
Your Majesty.</font>

346
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an emotional time
and we acted emotionally.</font>

347
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:30,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the real question is,
how did the school respond?</font>

348
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:35,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">The riot was exacerbated
by the school security staff's</font>

349
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">heavy-handed and, frankly,
insane response.</font>

350
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:40,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everyone.</font>

351
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so sorry
to pop in like this.</font>

352
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really hope I'm not
interrupting.</font>

353
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:44,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wanted to see how
everything's going,</font>

354
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:47,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those are for you fellas.</font>

355
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never forget a face
or a favorite cookie.</font>

356
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I brought extras,
because I know how Richie</font>

357
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">got into that
last basket I brought.</font>

358
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably good to have a backup.</font>

359
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did. I did get into
them pretty good.</font>

360
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">So everything going okay?</font>

361
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:03,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or are you guys going to
trash this building too?</font>

362
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we were just going
over the charges.</font>

363
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like you had your hands
full with these individuals.</font>

364
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is crazy.</font>

365
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys are really buying this?
- Excuse me?</font>

366
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang is a psychopathic
wannabe warlord</font>

367
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an army
of prepubescent thugs.</font>

368
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was living in the school's
air vent system</font>

369
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a monkey!</font>

370
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not...</font>

371
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, where's the Dean?
He'll tell you.</font>

372
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.
Can't stay, gotta run,</font>

373
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:29,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh, these troublemakers
have got to go.</font>

374
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've heard enough,</font>

375
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:35,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't see
what choice I have.</font>

376
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:37,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale Seven...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">you are hereby expelled from
Greendale Community College.</font>

00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:53,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">May God have mercy
on your souls.</font>

386

<font color="#FFFFFF">Rusty bucket?
Rusty bucket?</font>

387
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rusty bucket?
- Yep.</font>

388
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, transform and roll out.</font>

389
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">13 years of college
down the drain.</font>

390
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:11,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna be
the first one in my family</font>

391
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:13,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">to graduate from
community college.</font>

392
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else graduated
from normal college.</font>

393
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now they're really gonna
give me a hard time.</font>

394
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:20,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're drinking?</font>

395
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, my life can't
get double ruined.</font>

396
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't believe we're expelled.
Greendale was our home.</font>

397
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, isn't it time
for you to explain</font>

398
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">that every failure
is also an opportunity?</font>

399
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whatever, I'm the worst.
- I'm also the worst.</font>

400
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:35,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not gonna argue,
but I am gonna forgive you.</font>

401
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the pizza.</font>

402
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll a die to see who gets it?</font>

403
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it.</font>

404
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys remember our
housewarming party?</font>

405
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would have happened
if I had just let Jeff</font>

406
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">roll the die that night?</font>

407
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assumed this was
the best timeline,</font>

408
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what if it's the darkest?</font>

409
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't
think anyone knows</font>

410
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you're talking about,</font>

411
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it does seem like things
couldn't get any worse.</font>

412
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:04,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

413
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all gonna
get through this.</font>

414
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:09,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all alive
and we're all fine.</font>

415
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Britta,
you're not the worst.</font>

416
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:16,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the best.</font>

417
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:18,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.
Things are bad.</font>

418
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:21,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're together.</font>

419
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes this
the perfect timeline.</font>

420
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
There are other timelines?</font>

421
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,217
