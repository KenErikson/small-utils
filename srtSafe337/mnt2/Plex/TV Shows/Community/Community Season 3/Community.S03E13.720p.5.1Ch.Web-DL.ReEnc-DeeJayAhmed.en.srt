right now, Troy.</font>

148
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.</font>

149
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance you've given
a second thought to joining</font>

150
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">my air conditioning
repair school?</font>

151
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:07,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

152
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:10,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of busy at the moment doing
some awesome work with Abed.</font>

153
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yeah, Abed.</font>

154
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys watch that television
show together, don't you?</font>

155
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector Spacetime.</font>

156
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny, Troy.</font>

157
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Abed have
always reminded me</font>

158
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the inspector
and his trusty constable Reggie.</font>

159
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool!</font>

160
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">The inspector, of course,
is smart, decisive,</font>

161
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Reggie is...</font>

162
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's Reggie.</font>

163
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie is trained
in zero-gravity martial arts</font>

164
00:06:32,923 --> 00:06:33,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">and has a whistle.</font>

165
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

166
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he never really
gets to blow the whistle</font>

167
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless the inspector
says it's okay.</font>

168
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less of a friendship,
more of a self-centered nerd</font>

169
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his naive, obedient lapdog.</font>

170
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I got a thing.</font>

171
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take care.</font>

172
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:52,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, according to the office,
this is the locker</font>

173
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:56,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the only Kim I've had
any class with since 2009.</font>

174
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonder what you did
to make her so mad.</font>

175
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the two of you made out,
and then you forgot about her.</font>

176
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:04,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, that's what
you think of me?</font>

177
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't make out
with forgettable women.</font>

178
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:07,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you?</font>

179
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for Kim McFadden.</font>

180
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is her locker, right?
- Are you serious?</font>

181
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:14,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">She slipped a note into
my locker a couple years ago.</font>

182
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I pissed her off
somehow.</font>

183
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm hoping to apologize.
- That might not be easy.</font>

184
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kim's no longer with us.</font>

185
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She died two weeks ago.
- What?</font>

186
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to drop that
on you and run,</font>

187
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's a rally
for Garrett.</font>

188
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we saved him.</font>

189
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:34,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we?</font>

190
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you recommend?</font>

191
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it to you, meat pusher?</font>

192
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like you might be
a vegetarian.</font>

193
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try
Subway's Veggie Delite.</font>

194
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try reading
Orwell's 1984.</font>

195
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have.
It's a great book.</font>

196
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really awakened me
in High School.</font>

197
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think kids should be forced
to read it.</font>

198
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.
Anyway, you're living it.</font>

199
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a human puppet with big
sandwich's hand up your ass.</font>

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you dreamt
of being?</font>

201
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:00,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately I'm not allowed
to discuss my former life</font>

202
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">or engage in any
nonplatonic relations,</font>

203
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">practice religion in public,</font>

204
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:06,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">or eat any nonfresh,
unhealthy food like that</font>

205
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">found anywhere outside Subway.</font>

206
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you getting all that?</font>

207
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to stand next to you
for a moment.</font>

208
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was worth it.</font>

209
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:19,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a good book by Orwell
or a Veggie Delite.</font>

210
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you, Subway?</font>

211
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">My eyesight ain't
what it used to be.</font>

212
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat these tater tots, Harry.</font>

213
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what it's worth, I think you
might see more than all of us.</font>

214
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see him smiling at you?</font>

215
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Top-notch whoresmanship,
Britta.</font>

216
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce.
- Sorry. Whoreswomanship.</font>

217
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgot it was the '90s.</font>

218
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

219
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway...
Thank you, Britta.</font>

220
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:47,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew we could count on you
to help us take him down!</font>

221
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep, that's me, the girl
who's going to destroy</font>

222
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">the big sandwich company
with the dreamy eyes.</font>

223
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!
We did it, Pierce.</font>

224
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Powerful passage, isn't it?</font>

225
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She had become
a physical necessity."</font>

226
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You circled this paragraph.</font>

227
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't say that I did.</font>

228
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think it's a striking
expression of love's ability</font>

229
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:26,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">to persevere within the cracks
and cogs of inhuman systems.</font>

230
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who were you, Subway,
before you were Subway?</font>

231
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't say.</font>

232
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to live
within the rules.</font>

233
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">This identity is my life.</font>

234
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I do this
for three more years,</font>

235
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can live a real dream.</font>

236
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least tell me
what that is.</font>

237
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to run a nonprofit
shelter for handicapped animals.</font>

238
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dogs with wheels for hind legs.</font>

239
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:46,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Deaf hamsters.
- One-eyed cats?</font>

240
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:49,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they weren't on the top
of my list, but sure.</font>

241
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go.</font>

242
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is getting
out of bounds for me.</font>

243
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat fresh.</font>

244
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:58,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should put the small ones
in the middle,</font>

245
00:09:58,794 --> 00:09:59,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the wall won't hold
the ceiling.</font>

246
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I always have
to be your Reggie?</font>

247
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

248
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to make
a blanket fort,</font>

249
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you never even gave it
a second thought.</font>

250
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not even your sidekick.
I'm your underkick.</font>

251
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said
you couldn't do anything.</font>

252
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to make a blanket
fort, that's fine with me.</font>

253
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:14,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

254
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't make it
part of my pillow fort.</font>

255
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

256
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll start it somewhere else.</font>

257
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:28,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun stacking pillows
like a baby.</font>

258
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:31,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, are you okay?</font>

259
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lying on campus furniture,
so no.</font>

260
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it about this Kim girl?</font>

261
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is someone who died
thinking I was a dick.</font>

262
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can never apologize.</font>

263
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can never change her mind.</font>

264
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes me a dick forever.</font>

265
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's
what an apology is?</font>

266
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">A spell you cast on another
person to make them forgive you?</font>

267
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies are opportunities
to admit your own mistakes.</font>

268
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:58,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologize to her locker.</font>

269
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:01,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how can I apologize if
I don't know what I did wrong?</font>

270
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:05,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, didn't she call you
inconsiderate?</font>

271
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds to me like you know
exactly what you did wrong.</font>

272
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:12,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leonard, what are you doing?
- Abed's fort needs pillows.</font>

273
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was going to lie there.</font>

274
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to invest
in IBM in 1952,</font>

275
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">but life is full
of disappointments.</font>

276
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eating fresh, are we?</font>

277
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you found any dirt
on Subway yet?</font>

278
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, nothing. I should
probably hang out with him more.</font>

279
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think?
I think you're falling for him.</font>

280
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not.
Who do you think I am?</font>

281
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lived in New York.</font>

282
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never lived anywhere.</font>

283
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a weapon
designed for sex.</font>

284
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only think
you lived in New York</font>

285
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I implanted
your memories.</font>

286
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Pierce, stop it!
Look what we're becoming.</font>

287
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry we pulled you
into this dirty game.</font>

288
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to stop.</font>

289
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're pulling you out...</font>

290
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right after
your last assignment.</font>

291
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:56,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">This pen is a microphone.</font>

292
00:11:56,514 --> 00:12:01,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's also a miniflask.</font>

293
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just drink ink?</font>

294
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just plant this on Subway,</font>

295
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll never have
to see him again.</font>

296
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until then,
keep him interested.</font>

297
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:12,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for God's sakes, slap
some life on those dead lips.</font>

298
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Abed.
How's the pillow fort going?</font>

299
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard making something
perfect, but it's worth it.</font>

300
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll remember that
when I'm being given a key</font>

301
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the secret guinness
record holders' clubhouse,</font>

302
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I'll be hanging with those
two fat guys on motorcycles</font>

303
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:29,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and being fitted
for a beard of bees.</font>

304
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:32,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo! Well, Troy, I just got
off the phone with Guinness,</font>

305
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they are sending
a representative</font>

306
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have a look-see
at your blanket fort.</font>

307
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are we world-record ready?
- Garrett?</font>

308
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:42,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are still more than 2,000
square feet shy of the record.</font>

309
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:45,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's pillow fort is the only
thing standing in our way.</font>

310
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what are we going
to do here, guys?</font>

311
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a way
we can connect them?</font>

312
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't connect the blanket
fort to the pillow fort</font>

313
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">and still call it
a pillow fort.</font>

314
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you could,
I'd rather see</font>

315
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:54,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">my work destroyed
than compromise it.</font>

316
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, Abed will destroy
his pillow fort,</font>

317
00:12:57,274 --> 00:13:00,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Troy will expand
his blanket fort into the space.</font>

318
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone wins.</font>

319
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except Abed, but you know,
not everyone can win.</font>

320
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you want, Troy?</font>

321
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me to destroy my pillow fort
so you could set your record?</font>

322
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:13,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is.
- Magnitude.</font>

323
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evacuate fort Abed,
and prepare for self-destruct.</font>

324
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir?
- Do it. We're done here.</font>

325
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop, pop, Captain.</font>

326
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Subway.</font>

327
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I was worried
you wouldn't come.</font>

328
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:39,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't stop thinking about you.
- Shh.</font>

329
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanted me to plant
a bug on you.</font>

330
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, and I won't.</font>

331
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:47,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our values, our identities...
they mean nothing to me now.</font>

332
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the primal remains.</font>

333
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me, you are simply
a physical necessity.</font>

334
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:54,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm.
- Mmm.</font>

335
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Subway.</font>

336
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subway.</font>

337
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Subway.
- Mmm.</font>

338
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Subway.</font>

339
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:07,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no.</font>

340
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is wrong, Pierce.</font>

341
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to open
a sandwich shop.</font>

342
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not sign up for this.</font>

343
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to get
your hands dirty, fine.</font>

344
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

345
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:19,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice knowing you, Subway.
If that is your real name.</font>

346
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh.</font>

347
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kim.
It's me, Jeff.</font>

348
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The inconsiderate jerk.</font>

349
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:41,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't remember
hurting you,</font>

350
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have to assume
that's what hurt you.</font>

351
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">God knows what crime
you've committed</font>

352
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:48,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deserve me
disregarding you entirely.</font>

353
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:50,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">But whatever your crime,
I think we both know</font>

354
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">the real crime is mine.</font>

355
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a self-centered,
shallow jackass.</font>

356
00:14:56,221 --> 00:15:00,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just want to...
thank you for your note</font>

357
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm going
to try and change.</font>

358
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:05,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wish you were here
to forgive me.</font>

359
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

360
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I do.</font>

361
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Kim.</font>

362
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:11,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

363
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said Kim was dead.</font>

364
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you never remember
who I am.</font>

365
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">First year, we hung out,
like, ten times.</font>

366
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And each time,
you introduced yourself to me.</font>

367
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:21,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I wrote that note.</font>

368
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then today, it's like
you still don't remember me.</font>

369
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... and you still assume
from my name that I am a girl.</font>

370
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had no choice but to make up
that awesome story</font>

371
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a dead chick to hurt you
like you hurt me.</font>

372
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:35,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sorry...</font>

373
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kim.
Right?</font>

374
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:40,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how long I've
waited to hear you say that?</font>

375
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this crap?</font>

376
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, this is Kim.</font>

377
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:47,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think because he had
a girl's name,</font>

378
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never took him seriously.</font>

379
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happens literally
all the time,</font>

380
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:54,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is insane because 16%
of all people named Kim are men.</font>

381
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:56,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Don't apologize to this guy.</font>

382
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:59,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You told me to apologize.
- To a dead girl's locker.</font>

383
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:03,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was
representing the sisterhood.</font>

384
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:04,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought I was
teaching you a lesson</font>

385
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">about all the girls
you dominate</font>

386
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then ignore.</font>

387
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to waste your energy
on some weird, cloying,</font>

388
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">hypersensitive stalker
with a girl's name.</font>

389
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
You are really mean.</font>

390
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it in a letter,
Jane Austen.</font>

391
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:24,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare to initiate
Protocol Omega.</font>

392
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:28,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye, pillow fort.
You were a beautiful dream.</font>

393
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:31,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than a dream.
It's here.</font>

394
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

395
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who understands
dedication</font>

396
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:37,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">to craftsmanship
in the face of mediocrity.</font>

397
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world is run
by the unremarkables.</font>

398
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:42,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do what you always do,
Abed.</font>

399
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't corrupt the host
to pacify the parasites.</font>

400
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:46,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask yourself...</font>

401
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What if I stopped worrying
about their acceptance of me?"</font>

402
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:53,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it fell
to the Reggies of the world</font>

403
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:57,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep up with the inspectors
or perish?</font>

404
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now please turn your head
while I crawl away.</font>

405
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going through some stuff
right now.</font>

406
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very insecure.</font>

407
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:10,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

408
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ask the questions here.</font>

409
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:15,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had sex with Subway,
and I recorded it.</font>

410
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

411
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:20,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.</font>

412
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, I'm going
to let this one slide.</font>

413
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What?</font>

414
00:17:23,012 --> 00:17:24,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we have
very strict rules</font>

415
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">against romantic entanglements</font>

416
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:28,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">with our corpohumanoids,
but at this point in time,</font>

417
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can't stop them
from having hearts.</font>

418
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">These two are clearly in love.</font>

419
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they want
to express that love</font>

420
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:39,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a perfectly healthy way,
then... okay, hold on.</font>

421
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Th... is this
what I think it is?</font>

422
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">That got unhealthy real quick.</font>

423
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">That... okay, that's...
yeah, that's weird.</font>

424
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is well out
of the mainstream.</font>

425
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
I was raised in the...</font>

426
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:53,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Bay Area, but I...
I'm a father now.</font>

427
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subway cannot stand for that,
and frankly, Rick,</font>

428
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I-I'm surprised you did.
- My name is Subway.</font>

429
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

430
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The bread is stale.
- No! No!</font>

431
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:07,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- Subway, I love you!</font>

432
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta!
- Shut up.</font>

433
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:09,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you?</font>

434
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if that'll be all,
I'll be on my way.</font>

435
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:16,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">If someone could
hand me my jacket.</font>

436
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's right over there on
the coatrack next to the door.</font>

437
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:22,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">If somebody could just hand it
to me, that would be great.</font>

438
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:26,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm confused.</font>

439
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just grab it
on your way out the door...</font>

440
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
Now I'm not leaving.</font>

441
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm just going
to sit for a while</font>

442
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and focus on how unacceptable
today was.</font>

443
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

444
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to apologize.</font>

445
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:44,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never realized I had my own
issues regarding gender roles,</font>

446
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was certainly unfair
of me to take them out on Kim.</font>

447
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

448
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:51,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Kim?</font>

449
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corporate America
has destroyed love.</font>

450
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:58,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Again?
- Subway!</font>

451
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:01,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.</font>

452
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you silly.
It is me, Subway.</font>

453
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

454
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a great time with you
last night in the pillow fort,</font>

455
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:10,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one exception being
the deviant sex act</font>

456
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:13,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">you initiated
without my consent.</font>

457
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat fresh.</font>

458
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

459
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:20,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa!
- Oh, jeez.</font>

460
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a situation
developing in the study room.</font>

461
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:24,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would elaborate,
but I am out of breath</font>

462
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I walked here
very briskly.</font>

463
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down!</font>

464
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm! Down!</font>

465
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:38,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on here?
- Abed won't tear down his fort.</font>

466
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have to compromise
my craftsmanship</font>

467
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:41,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to placate mediocrity.
- Mediocrity?</font>

468
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, b...
boys, boys.</font>

469
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:46,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Guinness rep will be here
in two days.</font>

470
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:49,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just flip a coin
to decide who has to back down?</font>

471
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:50,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No.</font>

472
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:53,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm Dean,
so I'm making the call.</font>

473
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pillow fort comes down.</font>

474
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, you stay back.
- Watch it, Star-Burns.</font>

475
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Alex!</font>

476
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:09,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is war!</font>

477
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:27,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back, back.
- Back.</font>

478
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:30,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go.
- Back, back, back in the fort.</font>

479
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:35,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be continued.</font>

480
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:45,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, it appears that
Troy Barnes' blanket fort</font>

481
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">may go to war with Abed Nadir's
pillow fort.</font>

482
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

483
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon Troy and Abed
will be torn asunder,</font>

484
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an unencumbered Troy
will turn to his destiny...</font>

485
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:58,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">The air conditioning
repair school.</font>

486
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a cold-blooded man,
sir.</font>

487
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:01,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

488
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:05,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">How unfortunate
for Troy and Abed.</font>

489
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you in band practice.</font>
