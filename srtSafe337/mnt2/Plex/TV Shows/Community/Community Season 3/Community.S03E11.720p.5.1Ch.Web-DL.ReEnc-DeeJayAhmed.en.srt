<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe Shirley.</font>

151
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:45,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should show up
at this wedding</font>

152
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">and be the most normal people
in the world.</font>

153
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I could go as normal man</font>

154
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you could be
my trusty sidekick ordinario.</font>

155
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
That's already weird.</font>

156
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:54,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd be playing into her hand.</font>

157
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should just show up
wearing boring gray suits</font>

158
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:00,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">with gray ties and gray shirts.</font>

159
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:01,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could dye our hair gray.</font>

160
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we could lay down on
the sidewalk and be invisible.</font>

161
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
maybe Shirley's got a point.</font>

162
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:07,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea.</font>

163
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we purged all
the weirdness from our systems?</font>

164
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You mean...
- A full 24-hour weird-down</font>

165
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the dreamatorium.</font>

166
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just you, me, and our
imaginations... no restraints.</font>

167
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the wedding, our temptation
to act weird will be gone.</font>

168
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm feeling more normal already.</font>

169
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crab walk home?
- Yeah.</font>

170
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:28,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, my ninth-grade
English teacher used to say,</font>

171
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">"there will always be a reason
not to follow your dreams."</font>

172
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the time, he meant
I was under the age of consent.</font>

173
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:35,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his words still apply.</font>

174
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:38,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure your wedding
is the reason you're bailing</font>

175
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on this business with Pierce?
- Uh, in the words</font>

176
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">of <i>my</i> ninth-grade
English teacher,</font>

177
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">"you are dippin' and dappin' and
don't know what's happenin'."</font>

178
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, we both went
to public school.</font>

179
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that
I don't want to see you slide</font>

180
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:50,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">- into your old comfort zone.
- You don't know that.</font>

181
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:53,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am gonna start a business...
Soon!</font>

182
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't help it if I have
floral arrangements to pick</font>

183
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:56,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a DJ to hire...</font>

184
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
if that really is your excuse,</font>

185
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will plan
your wedding for you!</font>

186
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh-hoo!
Thank you.</font>

187
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my good God.
Thank you for that.</font>

188
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:13,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was serious.</font>

189
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:17,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're not
planning my wedding.</font>

190
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What if Annie helps?
- Oh, hey, guys.</font>

191
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:22,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone say "Annie",
"help,"wedding,"</font>

192
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">and something
about maybe hydrangeas?</font>

193
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
you can lie to yourself,</font>

194
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't lie to me.</font>

195
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:30,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not use your second wedding
as an excuse to limit yourself.</font>

196
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:33,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, come here.</font>

197
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, do you take this man
to be your business partner?</font>

198
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm, I guess.
- Sure.</font>

199
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to shelve
the trouser bench anyway.</font>

200
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are still some parts
of the prototype</font>

201
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:47,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">that need to be extracted.</font>

202
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:50,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're misunderstanding?</font>

203
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, from my butt.</font>

204
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

205
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet Shirley,</font>

206
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:02,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's modern, she's urban,
she's fun, and she's hungry.</font>

207
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:05,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably notice she's black,
but not a stereotype...</font>

208
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Suburban black.
- Is she suburban or urban?</font>

209
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's half-urban.</font>

210
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say...
Writer's secret, bad pitch...</font>

211
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her father's a record producer,
her mother's a Shirelle.</font>

212
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're supposed to be
preparing a business pitch.</font>

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about revenue projections?
What are the margins gonna be?</font>

214
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:22,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, Shirley, Shirley,</font>

215
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, Shirley,
Shirley, Shirley.</font>

216
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet, innocent Shirley.</font>

217
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was the question?
- Look,</font>

218
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">this was Britta's stupid idea.</font>

219
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather be with my man,
planning my wedding,</font>

220
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'd clearly rather be
with Halle Berry in 1999.</font>

221
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleasure not doing business
with you.</font>

222
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
Hawthorne wipes fired me.</font>

223
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:49,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were just waiting for my
dad to be out of the picture.</font>

224
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not an entrepreneur.</font>

225
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a kid
with a bunch of money, I...</font>

226
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:58,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please,
help me be somebody.</font>

227
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me invest in you.</font>

228
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">First thing we need
to figure out is our overhead.</font>

229
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a pen?</font>

230
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

231
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops.</font>

232
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">These pockets.</font>

233
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know someone
that can buy a pen?</font>

234
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:18,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

235
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, have you thought
about the color story</font>

236
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:21,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your wedding?</font>

237
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:22,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">He means
the theme of the wedding.</font>

238
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:24,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, Dale?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

239
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:25,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same theme as every wedding...</font>

240
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conformity, blind participation,
and patriarchal...</font>

241
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about pink?
- We don't call it pink.</font>

242
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't call anything
by its name.</font>

243
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, like,
day-one floral school stuff.</font>

244
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:35,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is citrine.
This is opalescent.</font>

245
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is sea glass, cameo,
and cerulean.</font>

246
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, how difficult is this?</font>

247
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do one of these,
one of these,</font>

248
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of these, this one,</font>

249
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:47,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">this one and, like,
stick a ribbon on it. Happy?</font>

250
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:52,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, that's a really
beautiful arrangement.</font>

251
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:54,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Color me lavender.</font>

252
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Lavender" means "impressed."</font>

253
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, great...
Flowers look good in a pot.</font>

254
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people dying
in Uganda.</font>

255
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

256
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What!</font>

257
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

258
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ahh, ahh, ahh.
- Don't eat my skin!</font>

259
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am shaving everything!</font>

260
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, that should do it.
- Yeah.</font>

261
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, isn't tonight
Shirley's wedding rehearsal?</font>

262
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at how we're dressed.</font>

263
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, this simply won't do.</font>

264
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's change
into something appropriate</font>

265
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the occasion
and be on our way.</font>

266
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree.</font>

267
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:27,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed being normal.</font>

268
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:31,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie!</font>

269
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:34,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help.</font>

270
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:37,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, you're, like,
sentimental and stuff.</font>

271
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

272
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really having trouble
coming up with a toast.</font>

273
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find that hard
to believe, Jeff.</font>

274
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You once convinced Troy</font>

275
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">that turtlenecks
were made of turtles' necks.</font>

276
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true, my superpower is
that I can assume any position</font>

277
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">that suits my purpose.
In that example...</font>

278
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:52,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keeping turtlenecks as an option
for myself, down the road.</font>

279
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I do have a kryptonite.</font>

280
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so obvious to me
that marriage is dumb,</font>

281
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:57,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't even pretend
to get behind it.</font>

282
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:59,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think
would make the perfect toast?</font>

283
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, as Shirley's friend
and a good guy,</font>

284
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">just saying what's really
in your heart.</font>

285
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:07,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something real
in there.</font>

286
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:11,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that's what scares you.</font>

287
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use a drink.</font>

288
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's sandwiches
can offer students</font>

289
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">more food for less money,
and provide the campus</font>

290
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a higher percentage
of the profits.</font>

291
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, put up the next slide.</font>

292
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's me!</font>

293
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd I get all that money
I'm holding?</font>

294
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna tell you
the three reasons</font>

295
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Shirley's sandwiches
and your cafeteria are going</font>

296
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:39,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be successful.</font>

297
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then
I'm writing this down, hmm?</font>

298
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

299
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a pen.</font>

300
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

301
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh</font>

302
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:57,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh...
- Holy crap!</font>

303
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:58,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're really good
at this.</font>

304
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:01,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- What's wrong with you?</font>

305
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">This may shock you, Annie,
but I come from a long line</font>

306
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">- of wives and mothers.
- Many do.</font>

307
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I ran away from it
my whole life.</font>

308
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I refused to give Santa
a Christmas list,</font>

309
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I didn't want to depend
on any man for anything.</font>

310
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:13,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, look at me!</font>

311
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Betty Crocker.
I'm Martha Stewart.</font>

the Steppenwolf wives.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh, God.</font>

314
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make some man
very happy someday.</font>

315
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:25,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Easy.
Slow down.</font>

316
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with you guys?</font>

317
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We de-whimsified ourselves.</font>

318
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. We're normal now.</font>

319
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Good?</font>

320
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, anybody seen Shirley?</font>

321
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Shirley's late to
the rehearsal for her wedding?</font>

322
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my.</font>

323
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man. You don't have
to be sarcastic.</font>

324
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not being sarcastic.</font>

325
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're heavily invested
in your situation.</font>

326
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's more important to us</font>

327
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">than your second wedding's
rehearsal going smoothly.</font>

328
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk away, man.</font>

329
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Did you think of a toast?</font>

330
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:54,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah.</font>

331
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:55,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I had a drink,</font>

332
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I looked in my heart,</font>

333
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:02,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here's what I got so far...</font>

334
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Webster's dictionary defines..."</font>

335
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gah! Stop!</font>

336
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Webster's dictionary defines"?</font>

337
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the Jim Belushi
of speech openings...</font>

338
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">It accomplishes nothing,
but everyone keeps using it</font>

339
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and nobody understands why.
- Yeah, well, it's all I got.</font>

340
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">That took me eight hours
and six macallan neatses.</font>

341
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry, I just
don't believe in marriage.</font>

342
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.
It's inevitable.</font>

343
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:25,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I'd put a counter
across here and the ovens there.</font>

344
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how fiscal will
the quarterly earnings be?</font>

346
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:31,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, initially, the fiscal...</font>

347
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:32,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, that question makes
no sense.</font>

348
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! I know.</font>

349
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to sound
as good at business as you are.</font>

350
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I probably shouldn't say this,</font>

351
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I cannot believe you learned
all this at Greendale.</font>

352
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:44,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're very professional.
- I am, aren't I?</font>

353
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought sodas,
so we can toast to our futures.</font>

354
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:49,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me now, dad.</font>

355
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:50,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?
Oh, my God,</font>

356
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to be
looking like a bride</font>

357
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:55,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my wedding rehearsal
to the dad of my children.</font>

358
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was...</font>

359
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">And odd dot to connect.</font>

360
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:07,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me another.</font>

361
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

362
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with you?</font>

363
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is who I am.</font>

364
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:17,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andre, sorry I'm late.</font>

365
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have wonderful news.</font>

366
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:21,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where were you?
- Uh, getting wonderful news.</font>

367
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dean loved our pitch and...</font>

368
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:24,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your pitch?</font>

369
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woman, I've been waiting for you
for two hours.</font>

370
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
Has it been that long?</font>

371
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

372
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you dare
use your sexy voice on me.</font>

373
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh.</font>

374
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:34,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a rehearsal.</font>

375
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord knows
we've done it before.</font>

376
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the point.</font>

377
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I thought
this wedding was supposed</font>

378
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be the start of us
getting back to normal.</font>

379
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back to normal?
- Yes.</font>

380
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to not be
Mr. Mom anymore.</font>

381
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I got to get back
to my stereo business.</font>

382
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know my store's
been struggling.</font>

383
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Andre,</font>

384
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">but "normal" went out the door
the day you did.</font>

385
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if we can't get back
to the way things were,</font>

386
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">why the hell are we
getting remarried?</font>

387
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oy...</font>

388
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">These shrimp are to die for.</font>

389
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah, yah, yah!</font>

390
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yah, yah, yah!</font>

391
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:15,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk the plank.</font>

392
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you've mistaken us
for pirates.</font>

393
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We</i> are
community college students.</font>

394
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I just had
an odd thought.</font>

395
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if once you go
from being weird to normal,</font>

396
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:27,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can never go back
to being weird again?</font>

397
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is an odd thought.</font>

398
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:29,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's hope it's the last.</font>

399
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers to that,
my everyday friend.</font>

400
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, everyone.</font>

401
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:38,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley asked me to say
something nice at her wedding.</font>

402
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the rehearsal.
- Shut up, Leonard!</font>

403
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those teenage girls you play
ping-pong with are doing it ironically.</font>

404
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well!</font>

405
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I searched my heart...</font>

406
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:50,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">For something nice to say
at a wedding.</font>

407
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I found nothing,
so I had a drink.</font>

408
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:55,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I looked real hard.</font>

409
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what I found?</font>

410
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daddy said he would stay
with my mommy forever,</font>

411
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he left!</font>

412
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:08,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marriage is a lie!
Nobody commits to this!</font>

413
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody stays with anybody
forever,</font>

414
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">so why do we keep lying?</font>

415
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:12,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stay
with somebody forever.</font>

416
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in my stupid DNA.</font>

417
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:19,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born to be a wife and
that's all I'm ever gonna be!</font>

418
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You expect anyone here
to believe that?</font>

419
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:23,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if anybody
believes it, jackass!</font>

420
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:25,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a fact!
- Prove it, ding dong!</font>

421
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a lot of layers
to this.</font>

422
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost too conceptual
to follow, but...</font>

423
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it.</font>

424
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's what this
was all about, Andre?</font>

425
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just about wanting me back
in the kitchen?</font>

426
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you loved
being a wife and a mother.</font>

427
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:37,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, but can't you see</font>

428
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's not all
I'm about anymore.</font>

429
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, sorry,
don't want to interrupt.</font>

430
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are cordially invited
to prevent a disaster.</font>

431
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:45,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise to put your dreams
before mine.</font>

432
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise to bottle up
my repulsion</font>

433
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the sight of your hair
in the drain.</font>

434
00:16:48,432 --> 00:16:51,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise to earn no more than
70% of what you would make</font>

435
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the same job.</font>

436
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about babies?
- What about 'em?</font>

437
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many?
- Pick a number, dick!</font>

438
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, it's up to me!</font>

439
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in God's name
are you two doing?</font>

440
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting married.</font>

441
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it look like
we're doing?</font>

442
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two are damn fools.
Oh, sorry.</font>

443
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:06,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll allow it.
- I am a fool.</font>

444
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:10,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a fool to think I wasn't
destined for a life of this.</font>

445
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look around.</font>

446
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:14,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you even imagine what kind
of wedding I could throw</font>

447
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I actually gave a crap?</font>

448
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No offense.
- Knock it off.</font>

449
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being good at weddings doesn't
make you good at marriage.</font>

450
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:22,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

451
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:23,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can make all sorts
of promises,</font>

452
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they never stick it out.</font>

453
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not something you
just stick out, man, all right?</font>

454
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a risk
that you take together.</font>

455
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't
just promise it once.</font>

456
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to promise it
every day.</font>

457
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but the person you're
making promises to</font>

458
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:36,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">is going to change.
You have to accept that.</font>

459
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.
But do you promise to be patient</font>

460
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:42,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">when that person's stereo
business takes a little while</font>

461
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:44,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to get off the ground.
- I do, but...</font>

462
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you accept that ten years
is more than a little while</font>

463
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that iPods
aren't going away,</font>

464
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maybe it's time to let
somebody else take the lead?</font>

465
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

466
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

467
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, baby, I swear I do.</font>

468
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I promise I will do
whatever it takes</font>

469
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make this work forever.</font>

470
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

471
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in that case,
let's rehearse this bad boy.</font>

472
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Actually,</font>

473
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">you pretty much just married
each other.</font>

474
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you let me pronounce you
man and wife,</font>

475
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can kiss the bride</font>

476
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:14,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you can save like, um,
70 bucks.</font>

477
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you say, baby?
- Mmm.</font>

478
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

479
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done and done.
Husband and wife.</font>

480
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now how about it?</font>

481
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:26,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's party!</font>

482
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lame.</font>

483
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:47,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

484
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed! Abed!</font>

485
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're weird.
We need to be weird.</font>

486
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:51,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to see something
weird? Check out this dance.</font>

487
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what did you call this?
The "Lindbergh lean"?</font>

488
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'll they think of next?</font>

489
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector spacetime...</font>

490
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh, thank the cosmic engineer
I found you.</font>

491
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, this is hardly the time.</font>

492
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is it hardly the space?</font>

493
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:08,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I see what you did there.</font>

494
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I have to get back
to my Lindbergh lean</font>

495
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">with, uh... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.</font>

496
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:14,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector...
What sort of creature</font>

497
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:18,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">would do a dance
called the Lindbergh lean?</font>

498
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Blorgons?
- Blorgons.</font>

499
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name's Danielle.</font>

500
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constable Reggie, it appears
the Blorgons have developed</font>

501
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:28,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the ability to take human form.
- Weirdos.</font>

502
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:34,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your photonic bowler hat.</font>

503
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh.</font>

504
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blorgon patrol.</font>

505
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I have some
good news and bad news.</font>

506
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:45,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">The good news is the board loved
your sandwich shop idea.</font>

507
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bad news
is that they made a few calls</font>

508
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sold the space to subway,
the sandwich place.</font>

509
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:53,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Pierce and I put
a lot of work into that idea.</font>

510
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How could you do this, Dean?
- I'm sorry!</font>

511
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The board went over my head
on this one.</font>

512
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't remember being
invited to your wedding,</font>

513
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:03,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I guess we're even
on the hurting-each-other front.</font>

514
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a blast at weddings.</font>

515
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:09,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">There go all my dreams.</font>

516
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just a setback.</font>

517
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to give up
just because of subway.</font>

518
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I better go break
the news to Pierce.</font>

519
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not gonna like this.</font>

520
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:17,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that
temper tantrum he threw</font>

521
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Adam Sandier "stole"
his idea for <i>Jack and Jill?</i></font>

522
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're underestimating him.</font>

523
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Pierce
is a lot more mature</font>

524
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">than we all give him
credit for.</font>

525
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:28,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me now, dad!
How's it taste?</font>

526
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many sandwich places
did you have?</font>

527
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">None!</font>
