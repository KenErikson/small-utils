when I leave you alone, huh?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">To Pierce. May he rest in Pierce.</font>

461
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, don't you think
you've had enough?</font>

462
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of you.</font>

463
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I've been thinking about
that night over and over.</font>

464
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:10,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">One thing has become clear.</font>

465
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the darkest,
most terrible timeline.</font>

466
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough with
the timeline crap, Abed!</font>

467
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce got shot
in the leg and died!</font>

468
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:19,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's a drunk.</font>

469
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's locked in a mental ward</font>

470
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">because her guilt
drove her insane.</font>

471
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff lost an arm in the fire.</font>

472
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy lost his larynx because,
for some dumb reason,</font>

473
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">he tried to destroy a flaming
troll doll by eating it.</font>

474
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly you don't understand</font>

475
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything about
defeating trolls.</font>

476
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:38,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life has gone to hell, Abed.</font>

477
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:39,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is real!</font>

478
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at us.
Look at me!</font>

479
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you put one wash-away
blue streak in your hair.</font>

480
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I lost an arm.</font>

481
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.
Life got dark.</font>

482
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all because
Jeff rolled a one.</font>

483
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love how this is
my fault somehow.</font>

484
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:52,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mine.</font>

485
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've run over that night
over and over in my head,</font>

486
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I keep coming back
to one thought.</font>

487
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've caught the die
and not let you roll it.</font>

488
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:00,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed to do that
and we all suffered for it.</font>

489
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm gonna
make it up to you.</font>

490
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:05,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

491
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:07,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of all the timelines,
this is clearly the darkest,</font>

492
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I propose
we commit to being evil.</font>

493
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made us all black goatees
out of felt.</font>

494
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:14,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you put them on until
you're able to grow your own.</font>

495
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on, I am evil Abed.</font>

496
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:19,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the evil study group,
and we have but one evil goal.</font>

497
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Return somehow
to the prime timeline,</font>

498
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one that I stopped you
from rolling that die,</font>

499
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we destroy
the good versions of ourselves,</font>

500
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">and reclaim our proper lives.</font>

501
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:29,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Evil Abed.
- Mm-hm?</font>

502
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:32,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">As evil Jeff, am I allowed
to pull fewer punches with you?</font>

503
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Certainly.
- I hate you!</font>

504
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up
with your Sci-Fi crap!</font>

505
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost my damn arm,</font>

506
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're making fake beards!</font>

507
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goatees.</font>

508
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:56,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ evil Troy
and evil Abed ♪</font>

509
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?</font>

510
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:08,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

511
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess nothing.</font>
