34
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,025

- I'd love to have a laugh.</font>

I'm not ashamed of my past.</font>

00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:18,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Oh, no, Britta!</font>

41
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">She invoked friendship
to undercut the laugh,</font>

42
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're still laughing.
That's how funny it is!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is Blade.
Is that legal?</font>

44

45

before that stupid movie.</font>

46
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:31,649

are reacting this way.</font>

54
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:48,923

that he is the worst on earth.</font>

55
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if he comes
through town and calls me,</font>

56
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be there
in five minutes.</font>

58
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,771

- I don't.</font>

59
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You will.
- What's that mean?</font>

60
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's hung.
- Oh, God!</font>

61
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:01,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you're disgusting.</font>

62
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:02,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like that
I'm disgusting again.</font>

63

a lot he couldn't get away with.</font>

You're in love with a guy</font>

150
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:17,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
that's a good idea.</font>

151
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if my mother died?</font>

152
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are really
talking over <i>Blade.</i></font>

153
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not cool!
- Annie, subdue your guest.</font>

154
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, think for one second.</font>

155
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have my phone,
and you're not even checking it.</font>

156
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:29,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if my mother is dying?</font>

157
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is junkie talk.</font>

158
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just wanna know
where your phone's hidden.</font>

159
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna know
if my mother is dying.</font>

160
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a simple yes or no.
I'll cover my eyes.</font>

161
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go check my phone and say,</font>

162
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:40,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">"no, your mother isn't dying"
or "yes, your mother is dying,"</font>

163
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:44,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we go back
to watching the film.</font>

164
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me!</font>

165
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:59,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Britta.
It's a banana.</font>

166
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:02,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is there a banana
in your DVD cabinet?</font>

167
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read the banana, Britta.</font>

168
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You are a lying junkie."</font>

169
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure those words hurt.</font>

170
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:11,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you wouldn't be reading them
if they weren't true.</font>

171
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so weak.</font>

172
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are not defined
by our limitations.</font>

173
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are defined
by our potentials.</font>

174
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the potential
to watch <i>Blade.</i></font>

175
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two are bad friends!
Bad.</font>

176
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:26,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's unfair.
What about you guys?</font>

177
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you don't like our movie,
we can't say the word "Blade,"</font>

178
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's phones
in the refrigerator.</font>

179
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops.</font>

180
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy, Abed!
- Let me see if he called!</font>

181
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a right to know!
You're monsters!</font>

182
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Hitlers!
You're racist pedophiles!</font>

183
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the opposites of Batman!</font>

184
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what that means.</font>

185
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna rip out your throats
and eat your—</font>

186
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still think the lock
was overkill?</font>

187
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

188
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's
phones in the refrigerator.</font>

189
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you.</font>

190
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Boys' night! ♪</font>

191
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need help reacting
to something.</font>

192
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:03,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!</font>

193
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember it's just a quick icky play.</font>

194
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell anyone we did this,</font>

195
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will stop letting you
do things with me</font>

196
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid
to tell anyone about.</font>

197
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:14,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I get it.</font>

198
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:15,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna take a look
at Britta's ex-boyfriend.</font>

199
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you did it by yourself,
you'd be weird.</font>

200
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only one
that really understands me.</font>

201
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:21,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, funky.</font>

202
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:22,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

203
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:24,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, are you guys on a date?</font>

204
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty awkward.
Look what Pierce won me.</font>

205
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:28,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

206
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I decided to go outside
the group for a best friend.</font>

207
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:31,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you couldn't do better
than Chang?</font>

208
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take that back!</font>

209
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could do plenty
better than me.</font>

210
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:36,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the first to say yes.</font>

211
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:37,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, have fun forcing life.</font>

212
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will.</font>

213
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you wanna do next?</font>

214
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cotton candy?
- Russian roulette?</font>

215
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did you say?
- Cotton candy sounds great.</font>

216
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:49,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

217
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?
Huh.</font>

218
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. He's not
as good-looking as you.</font>

219
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:58,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wasn't fishing for that.
- No, no, no.</font>

220
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offered it freely.
Come on, I wanna go on a ride.</font>

221
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a window for me.</font>

222
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent my carnival years
pregnant.</font>

223
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I'm not jealous.</font>

224
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:06,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to see
what the deal was.</font>

225
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously the deal is
he's a dirtball,</font>

226
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta hates herself, voila.</font>

227
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you wanna do?</font>

228
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to go on a ride.</font>

229
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go shoot some ducks.</font>

230
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

231
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight of clubs.
I win.</font>

232
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice!</font>

233
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you feeling?
- Good.</font>

234
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:26,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, actually.
Thank you, Annie.</font>

235
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:27,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could've never done this
without you.</font>

236
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad to be able
to help you.</font>

237
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:30,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to know—</font>

238
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've never said
these words—</font>

239
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've always felt them.</font>

240
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a sister to me.</font>

241
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta!</font>

242
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

243
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, little sis,</font>

244
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you think you could trust me
to have my phone back now?</font>

245
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got my email on there,</font>

246
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:48,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">my calendar,
homework assignments.</font>

247
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kinda screwed without it.</font>

248
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not just
manipulating me, right?</font>

249
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, because of...
Oh, jeez.</font>

250
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, whatever.
That's over, Annie.</font>

251
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously.</font>

252
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I have it right here.</font>

253
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a gateway
to further trust.</font>

254
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.
Thank you.</font>

255
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love the gateway.
Honoring the gateway.</font>

256
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to call my doctor
for some results.</font>

257
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, I'm fine.
It's just a little personal.</font>

258
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need privacy, sure thing.
I'll check on you later.</font>

259
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.
Thank you, sweetie.</font>

260
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, this guy doesn't
give vampires</font>

261
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">a square inch of leeway.</font>

262
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's harsh.</font>

263
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong, Annie?</font>

264
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came out of the bedroom
smiling,</font>

265
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then your smile faded
as you leaned against the door.</font>

266
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave Britta her phone.</font>

267
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did?
Why?</font>

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs to feel trust
to recover, or she'll relapse.</font>

269
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gonna relapse
because you gave her her phone.</font>

270
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I secretly switched
Blade's number in her phone</font>

271
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">to my number.</font>

272
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:48,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if she tries to get
in touch with him,</font>

273
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- it'll come to me.
- That's diabolical.</font>

274
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:51,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
you're just like Blade, man.</font>

275
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Straight up.</font>

276
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope she can find
the strength to—</font>

277
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's probably just telling him</font>

278
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's... dying to feel
the warmth of his...</font>

279
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?</font>

280
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said we were sisters.</font>

281
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sad right now.</font>

282
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she is so codependent!</font>

283
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">And such a bad speller.</font>

284
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice shootin'.
Tough luck.</font>

285
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:23,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
I'll go another round.</font>

286
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's room in our bed
for three bears, right, honey?</font>

287
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then some, sugar.</font>

288
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:29,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very nice...</font>

289
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a man named...
What'd you say it was? Blade?</font>

290
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

291
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's a carnival name
though, right?</font>

292
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">A <i>nom de</i> corn dog?</font>

293
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:37,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I have
a carnival name?</font>

294
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents named you Blade?</font>

295
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:40,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently.</font>

296
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:43,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you seem okay with it.</font>

297
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much to do about it.</font>

298
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:46,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could change it.</font>

299
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:49,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what?
Templeton Ferrari III?</font>

300
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't change
how mustard tastes.</font>

301
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

302
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Won't change
how mustard tastes.</font>

303
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.
I see the appeal.</font>

304
00:10:58,134 --> 00:10:59,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's relaxed, he's cool.</font>

305
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">N-not as cool as you.</font>

306
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Blade.
I want three more rounds.</font>

307
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

308
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not gonna change
the way mustard tastes.</font>

309
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and you're so cool,
Shirley.</font>

310
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:11,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I am.</font>

311
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times
are they gonna do that?</font>

312
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:17,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, this is it, isn't it?</font>

313
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:19,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're becoming best friends.</font>

314
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.
I think so.</font>

315
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:27,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Would you let me
be your best friend ♪</font>

316
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I would call you every day ♪</font>

317
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:36,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!
One after the other!</font>

318
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm texting to tell you
I'm not texting you any more.</font>

319
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.</font>

320
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Are you mad at me now?</font>

321
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. I guess you don't
wanna know our two-year-old."</font>

322
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we please just put it</font>

323
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">under a stack of mattresses
or something?</font>

324
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:49,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
When is she gonna take a hint?</font>

325
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:51,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's attracted
to unavailable men.</font>

326
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean, why are you here?
- Ouch.</font>

327
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Let's make him
available.</font>

328
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Ending this.</font>

329
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Leave me alone."
No!</font>

330
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:05,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so much worse.</font>

331
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?
She stopped.</font>

332
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:13,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's calling him?</font>

333
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was born in the '80s.</font>

334
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:16,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">She still uses her phone
as a phone.</font>

335
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-oh.
- That's fine, it's fine.</font>

336
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just won't answer it.
- Won't it go to your voicemail?</font>

337
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:26,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello? Blade?</font>

338
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:34,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

339
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know!</font>

340
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change your settings
so it doesn't go to voicemail.</font>

341
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:40,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too late.</font>

342
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys act like a carnival.
<i>Be</i> a carnival.</font>

343
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

344
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Step right up!
- Ding, ding, ding!</font>

345
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:48,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your popcorn here.</font>

346
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- Busy, babe.</font>

347
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blade, just wait.
Wait, Bla...</font>

348
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you not to call me
at work!</font>

349
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm sorry, I forgot.</font>

350
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be mad at me."</font>

351
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's whipped
by an imaginary douche.</font>

352
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't knock it
till you try it.</font>

353
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my fake
bachelor's degree,</font>

354
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:10,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I cheated on the LSAT:</font>

355
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're probably wondering,
how do you cheat on the LSAT?</font>

356
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:13,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

357
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">A magician never reveals
his secrets, my friend.</font>

358
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

359
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah! In your face!
- Good job.</font>

360
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, give me the big one!
Yeah, that's the one.</font>

361
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

362
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not too shabby, huh?</font>

363
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you really did it, baby.</font>

364
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you dropped
out of high school</font>

365
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">and joined the carnival.</font>

366
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">And 15 years later,
here you are.</font>

367
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeffrey!
- Guess that's about it.</font>

368
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the record?</font>

369
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the best anyone's
ever done in this booth?</font>

370
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I guess eight ducks.
- All right, one more round.</font>

371
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more round.</font>

372
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff?
- Honey?</font>

373
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you excuse us
just for a moment, please?</font>

374
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly.</font>

375
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you get over here?</font>

376
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is your end game here?
- I don't know.</font>

377
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wanna know.
- Wanna know what?</font>

378
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know what drove Britta
crazy about him.</font>

379
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you jealous?
Are you in love with Britta?</font>

380
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I am not in love
with Britta.</font>

381
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yes, I'm insanely
jealous of him.</font>

382
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's his secret?</font>

383
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you wanna know the
secret to making a woman psycho?</font>

384
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do we wanna know
how to blow up the earth</font>

385
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">or grow a human ear on a mouse?</font>

386
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case we have to, Shirley.</font>

387
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case we have to.</font>

388
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:18,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm going to find Pierce.
- Good!</font>

389
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of those bears is mine!</font>

390
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:23,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is best friendship.</font>

391
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something else, isn't it?</font>

392
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we keep it going?</font>

393
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we know
we won't get into a fight?</font>

394
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we just let it happen.</font>

395
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:32,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me what to do!</font>

396
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your problem?
- What's yours?</font>

397
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:34,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm outta here!</font>

398
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:41,540

<font color="#FFFFFF">Blade, 'sup?
Message.</font>

405
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. We can stop worrying
about voicemail now.</font>

406
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the matter at hand.</font>

407
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what are you doing?</font>

408
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean, why are you here?
- Yikes.</font>

409
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured it out.
I know exactly what to do.</font>

410
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna be really,
really, really mean to her.</font>

411
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:24,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh.</font>

412
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">What don't you get
about the concept?</font>

413
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta likes guys
who are mean to her.</font>

414
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:31,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't like herself.</font>

415
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:34,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the phone.</font>

416
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

417
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something nice.</font>

418
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:44,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.</font>

419
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:48,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm deleting it
from your phone.</font>

420
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:51,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- What's up?</font>

421
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys still watching movies?</font>

422
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Dean.
Why are you here?</font>

423
00:15:57,283 --> 00:15:59,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Britta.
And ouch.</font>

424
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:01,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't know anything
about carpentry.</font>

425
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:02,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nope.
- Or aquariums—</font>

426
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">freshwater or saltwater.</font>

427
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you have a big weiner?

428
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it, Blade!</font>

429
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your secret?
Why do I wanna impress you?</font>

430
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:15,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you dumb or smart?
Are you a loser or winner?</font>

431
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or are you just a human mirror?</font>

432
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we all see
what we wanna see in you?</font>

433
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:21,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">A magician never reveals,
right?</font>

434
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

435
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later.</font>

436
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:30,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

437
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dropped over 300 bucks
on my booth, so I'll tell ya.</font>

438
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:36,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna know my secret?</font>

439
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

440
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:43,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

441
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:48,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

442
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know.</font>

443
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm sorry.</font>

444
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was texting with Blade,
but it's over now.</font>

445
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's... a loser.</font>

446
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:01,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

447
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, uh, uh...
Troy!</font>

448
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:05,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should really join</font>

449
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">the air conditioning
repair program.</font>

450
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Well, that didn't work.</font>

451
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:10,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I get
for improvising.</font>

452
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

453
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:14,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I don't get it.</font>

454
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a vampire, but he can
walk around during the day?</font>

455
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What... is wrong with you?
- Huh?</font>

456
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't texting Blade,
you were texting us.</font>

457
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I switched Blade's number
in your phone to mine.</font>

458
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:29,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You tricked me?
- You tricked me!</font>

459
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask for my help,
you tell me I'm your sister,</font>

460
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:35,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do everything I can
to make you hate this turd,</font>

461
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:38,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the first nice thing
he says, and you're over him?</font>

462
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:41,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

463
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why didn't it stick?</font>

464
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:46,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was texting with you guys
this whole time?</font>

465
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:50,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Blade... isn't a loser!</font>

466
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

467
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:55,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, let her go.
Lost cause, man.</font>

468
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff!
What are you doing here?</font>

469
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got back
from the carnival...</font>

470
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:00,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I met Blade.</font>

471
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:01,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he okay?
How is he?</font>

472
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's brain damaged.</font>

473
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, let's not be petty.
- No, I'm serious.</font>

474
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He showed me the scar.</font>

475
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:07,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten years ago,
before he even met you,</font>

476
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">a loose bolt flew off
a Ferris wheel</font>

477
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">and imbedded in his skull,</font>

478
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:16,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">destroying the part of his brain
that feels shame.</font>

479
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's basically irresistible
to people for the same reason</font>

480
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:24,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">he can pretty much only work
at a carnival.</font>

481
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has nothing to prove
or disprove</font>

482
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">about himself or to himself.</font>

483
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has no shame.</font>

484
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't he
have told me that?</font>

485
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he didn't care
if you knew.</font>

486
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so like him.</font>

487
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have to go to him.
- No, woman.</font>

488
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:42,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us have to
"go to" anyone.</font>

489
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:43,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the idea we do
is a mental illness</font>

490
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">we contracted
from breath mint commercials</font>

491
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Sandra Bullock.</font>

492
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't keep going
to each other</font>

493
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:53,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we learn to go
to ourselves.</font>

494
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop making our hatred
of ourselves someone else's job</font>

495
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:59,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just stop hating ourselves.</font>

496
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:10,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I want you
to take my phone.</font>

497
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not let me call Chang.</font>

498
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:15,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm locking myself
in your room.</font>

499
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:18,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys
doing out here?</font>

500
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Self-actualizing.</font>

501
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's loud.</font>

502
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come watch <i>Blade.</i></font>

503
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

504
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">This movie is fantastic.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">so yesterday, typical Sunday.</font>

513
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hanging out

514
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

515

<font color="#FFFFFF">This ever happen to you guys?</font>

516
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't remember
where I imagined the door.</font>

517
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:32,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I realized I was in
an actual bathroom.</font>

518
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no offense,
but this material</font>

519
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">seems pretty specific
to your apartment.</font>

520
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:40,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it'll work
at an open mic.</font>

521
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all ever notice
the difference</font>

522
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:48,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">between me and Troy
brushing our teeth?</font>

523

<font color="#FFFFFF">I brush my teeth like this.</font>

524
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:55,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy brushes his teeth
like this.</font>

525
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:57,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do!</font>

526
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,226
