00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop pop!</font>

151
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect, so now we gotta solve
a robbery too.</font>

152
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whoever did it
likes to steal backpacks</font>

153
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:47,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">off tables in the library.</font>

154
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:50,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one way to catch
a dirtbag like that.</font>

155
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:58,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, time to visit
the restroom.</font>

156
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found that backpack.</font>

157
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, idiot, guess what.</font>

158
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't care about
the backpack.</font>

159
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead yam, big deal.</font>

160
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:31,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Order some ketchup.</font>

161
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:33,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make sense.
You don't order ketchup.</font>

162
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a condiment!</font>

163
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, Troy, hey, walk it off!</font>

164
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, walk it off!</font>

165
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, my friend,
he's a bad cop.</font>

166
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- I'm a good cop.</font>

167
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:41,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, good.
- You can trust me.</font>

168
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well... hey!</font>

169
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not falling for that.</font>

170
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you got nothing on me.</font>

171
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't have to stay here,
'cause you're not cops.</font>

172
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.
You're not cops.</font>

173
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say our hands are tied,
but we basically have no hands.</font>

174
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's our man though, right?</font>

175
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well he ain't innocent.</font>

176
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'll try
to keep him busy.</font>

177
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:05,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys go to the lab,
see if they figured out</font>

178
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">how our yam met its masher.</font>

179
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can both see and hear you.</font>

180
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">The yam's vascular cylinder
is completely disintegrated.</font>

181
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any possibility
it happened naturally?</font>

182
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, if the gardener's
Joseph Mengele.</font>

183
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the root system.</font>

184
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">This level of smushing
is consistent</font>

185
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">with someone stepping on the yam
after it was dropped.</font>

186
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So whoever did this was angry.</font>

187
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:26,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I just cut 'em open.</font>

188
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want motive,
talk to a shrink.</font>

189
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I can tell you is that for
a raw yam to get it this bad,</font>

190
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need more than gravity.</font>

191
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need a boot.</font>

192
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to tell Professor Kane.</font>

193
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing here
to connect to Star-Burns.</font>

194
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd have to confess.</font>

195
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:43,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, sure.</font>

196
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe if we ask him nice,</font>

197
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll write us
a love letter too.</font>

198
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:49,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whoever did do this does
owe you guys a letter.</font>

199
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">An "A."</font>

200
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:57,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">This yam was about to bloom.</font>

201
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:58,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

202
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:02,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">We named the yam "Pam."</font>

203
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:04,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">It rhymed.</font>

204
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:07,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if we could prove</font>

205
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:08,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Star-Burns stole
Magnitude's key,</font>

206
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not enough.</font>

207
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we know Star-Burns
did it.</font>

208
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:12,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep the change, Garret.</font>

209
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
Keep the hot dog.</font>

210
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me
after all this,</font>

211
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:16,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">our suspect's gonna slip away</font>

212
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the technicality
that we're not police?</font>

213
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look,
you don't need authority</font>

214
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get a confession.</font>

215
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:23,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need leverage.
Something to hold over his head.</font>

216
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like what?
- He's Star-Burns.</font>

217
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break into his locker.</font>

218
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:26,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find enough dirt
to bury him.</font>

219
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, that's not ethical.</font>

220
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so now you're
finding your softness?</font>

221
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:32,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say do what you have to do.</font>

222
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late
to get compassionate.</font>

223
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:36,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only have time
to get justice.</font>

224
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really shouldn't
be doing this.</font>

225
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're sure you heard
a kitten meowing in here?</font>

226
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore, so hurry up.</font>

227
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, Nelly!</font>

228
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clean up on aisle "busted."</font>

229
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:57,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they always r...</font>

230
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:58,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they always...</font>

231
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:00,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You go ahead.
- Why do they always run?</font>

232
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

233
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

234
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:06,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not police business!</font>

235
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, knock much?</font>

236
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kiss me!
- What?</font>

237
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:11,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll explain later.</font>

238
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:12,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- I'll explain later.</font>

239
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The explanation
isn't the issue.</font>

240
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

241
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all right, all right.</font>

242
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:20,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I-I swiped some
beakers for the meth lab</font>

243
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'm building
in the trunk of my car.</font>

244
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's it.</font>

245
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't kill any yam.</font>

246
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell it
to the biology Professor.</font>

247
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now wait!</font>

248
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who did it.</font>

249
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left the door open
and someone came in.</font>

250
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">He dropped your yam.</font>

251
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you tell
our teacher who it was?</font>

252
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you promise
I won't get in trouble</font>

253
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">for stealing that
meth lab stuff.</font>

254
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure, whatever.
- Fine.</font>

255
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pinky swear?</font>

256
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:46,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the guy with
the weird head.</font>

257
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">The army guy.</font>

258
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:48,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard the jar break and then</font>

259
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him running out
of the room holding his hand.</font>

260
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:56,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looked like he cut himself.</font>

261
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well.</font>

262
00:09:58,558 --> 00:09:59,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this, Abed.</font>

263
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">He weaves baskets and lies.</font>

264
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:02,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this about?</font>

265
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about the killing
of our biology yam.</font>

266
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please come with us?</font>

267
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm in the middle
of making a handle.</font>

268
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants it the hard way.
Tell him what Shirley said.</font>

269
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Todd Jacobson, you have the
right to do whatever you want.</font>

270
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:14,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing you say or do can be
used against you by anyone,</font>

271
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we'd really like it
if you came with us.</font>

272
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please and thank you.</font>

273
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:19,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it quick, folks.</font>

274
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:22,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a class in five minutes
and none of you guys are in it.</font>

275
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">After conducting
a full investigation,</font>

276
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">my study group now has
definitive proof that Todd,</font>

277
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">with malice of forethought,
smashed our yam.</font>

278
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a serious allegation.
I hope you can back it up.</font>

279
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can place him
in the building Monday night.</font>

280
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a mysterious
bandage on his hand,</font>

281
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we have and eyewitness who
saw Todd drop the jar and flee.</font>

282
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:40,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Todd, what do you
have to say?</font>

283
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just wanna...
- Don't answer that, soldier!</font>

284
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This man is an American hero.
- And who are you?</font>

285
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:49,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Lieutenant Colonel Archwood,
United States Army.</font>

286
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had the pleasure of commanding
this young man in Iraq.</font>

287
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm staying on his couch
this weekend</font>

288
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I'm in town
for a wedding.</font>

289
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a licensed attorney,
a veteran of two wars,</font>

290
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:02,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd like to know why in hell
he's being harassed.</font>

291
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger,
what is the intention here?</font>

292
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:07,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple. When Todd smashed our
yam, he stole an "A" from us.</font>

293
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want it back.</font>

294
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,964
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You mean if he smashed the yam.</i></font>

295
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:13,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have is the word
of this Mr. Star-Burns,</font>

296
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:16,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">who offers up no explanation
as to why he was at the scene.</font>

297
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about it, Jeffrey?</font>

298
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:19,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was Star-Burns
doing there?</font>

299
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">We agreed to withhold
that information</font>

300
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">as part of a pinky swear
with the witness.</font>

301
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pinky swear?</font>

302
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:27,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ludicrous.
This whole school is ludicrous.</font>

303
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who honors the pinky swear
of a degenerate</font>

304
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">over the word
of a decorated soldier?</font>

305
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm inclined to agree
with the man in uniform.</font>

306
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shocker.
- Jeffrey.</font>

307
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:38,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what Star-Burns
was doing in that classroom,</font>

308
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">or your group can take an "F."</font>

309
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold up, hold up, hold up.</font>

310
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grade my students.</font>

311
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:46,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what Star-Face was doing
there is irrelevant.</font>

312
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">What matters is what he saw.</font>

313
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm upholding the pinky swear.</font>

314
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

315
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, man, you spent
your life in the army.</font>

316
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent mine in prison.</font>

317
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:57,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two places where a man's word
is only as good as his uniform.</font>

318
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now out here,
it's supposed to be different.</font>

319
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:02,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in my class, it will be.</font>

320
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two can plead
your case to the class</font>

321
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:07,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let them
decide your grades.</font>

322
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor...
Thank you.</font>

323
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a favor,
Mr. Winger.</font>

324
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man's gotta have a code.</font>

325
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

326
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you in class.</font>

327
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uniform.
- Oh!</font>

328
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez.</font>

329
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

330
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley did some more digging.</font>

331
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out Todd's yam
never even sprouted.</font>

332
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goes to motive.</font>

333
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Star-Burns puts Todd
in the classroom at 8:10.</font>

334
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:35,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opportunity.</font>

335
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add to that a cut on the hand</font>

336
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Winger charm,
we might get an A-plus-plus.</font>

337
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still have
a lot of work to do.</font>

338
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:42,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think you've done enough.</font>

339
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colonel Archwood
got to Star-Burns.</font>

340
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Threatened to involve
the real cops.</font>

341
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Star-Burns is in the wind.</font>

342
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's our only witness.</font>

343
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">That what you guys do in here?</font>

344
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:52,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You push your little papers</font>

345
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you make your
little speeches,</font>

346
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in the end another
dirtbag walks?</font>

347
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?
Huh?</font>

348
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed! Abed!</font>

349
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed! Walk it off!</font>

350
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk it off!</font>

351
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about my partner.</font>

352
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:11,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">He... he's been on edge
ever since we switched.</font>

353
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

354
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, that class
already hates us.</font>

355
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we go in there without
a case, they'll fail us.</font>

356
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have proof
our yam was murdered</font>

357
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now you find your softness?</font>

358
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's eat or be eaten
when that's convenient,</font>

359
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:26,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when the going gets tough,
Winger gets nervous, huh?</font>

360
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no case, Annie.</font>

361
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late to get one, Jeff.</font>

362
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only have time
to get justice.</font>

363
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what happened next,
Todd.</font>

364
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I disarmed the I.E.D.</font>

365
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">and returned the child
to his mother.</font>

366
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">She offered to give me her only
possession... a wooden chair...</font>

367
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I refused.</font>

368
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:50,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only doing my duty
and we had</font>

369
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:51,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">plenty of chairs at the base.</font>

370
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:54,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for your valor,
you were awarded a bronze star.</font>

371
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, you have an absolutely
glowing service record.</font>

372
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't you, private?
- I do my best.</font>

373
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do more than that, soldier.</font>

374
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly more
than this witness</font>

375
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">who supposedly saw you
kill the yam.</font>

376
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man who for all we know</font>

377
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a holocaust-denying,
9/11 pedophile.</font>

378
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Objection.
- Withdrawn.</font>

379
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">One last question.</font>

380
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:14,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you intentionally
break into</font>

381
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">the biology room
with the express purpose</font>

382
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">of killing
the study group's yam?</font>

383
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir, I did not.
- Thank you, soldier.</font>

384
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">And God bless your testimony.</font>

385
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your witness.</font>

386
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:34,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Todd, do you
consider yourself a hero?</font>

387
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

388
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not.</font>

389
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hero doesn't call
himself a hero.</font>

390
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hero gets called a hero
because of what he does.</font>

391
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with your
impressive record,</font>

392
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:43,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">not even I could
deny you the title.</font>

393
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Objection, she's clearly
ramping up to something.</font>

394
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Objection, that's not
a real objection.</font>

395
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Objection, I hate
the both of you.</font>

396
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may proceed, Ms. Edison,
but do so with caution.</font>

397
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need I remind you
this is not a courtroom?</font>

398
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:55,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent the majority
of last night</font>

399
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">going over your records
with Mr. Winger,</font>

400
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:01,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">scouring them for the slightest
mistake, the tiniest slip up.</font>

401
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:05,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I gotta tell you, Todd.
Couldn't find a thing.</font>

402
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not one little smudge.</font>

403
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:13,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except, of course, for one pesky
yam that just wouldn't grow.</font>

404
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">That had to weigh on your soul,
didn't it, Todd?</font>

405
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe a little.
- A little?</font>

406
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:20,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">A big orange splotch
on your perfect record?</font>

407
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet that pissed you
right off, didn't it?</font>

408
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you hit your wife?</font>

409
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:26,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Withdrawn.</font>

410
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you drink
and pop pills?</font>

411
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:28,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Withdrawn.</font>

412
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:30,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a virgin?
Withdrawn.</font>

413
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:31,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you...</font>

414
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:36,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">kill our yam to settle
the score, huh?</font>

415
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:39,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did stomping on its roots
make you feel like a big man?</font>

416
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:40,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it didn't.</font>

417
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I didn't...</font>

418
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:44,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Todd, zip it.</font>

419
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you zip it, Uncle Knobby.</font>

420
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not fighting
your wars anymore.</font>

421
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:49,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, Todd.</font>

422
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:53,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how scary
a failing grade can be,</font>

423
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:56,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this one dead yam
won't tarnish your record.</font>

424
00:15:56,092 --> 00:16:00,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will tarnish it
is lying to your class,</font>

425
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:02,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">to your teacher, and to me.</font>

426
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">The American citizen
you've sworn to protect.</font>

427
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:07,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Todd.</font>

428
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop disappointing me.</font>

429
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Defuse the I.E.D.
of dishonesty.</font>

430
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an accident.</font>

431
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:19,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted
to look at your yam,</font>

432
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:23,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when I picked up the jar,
it burnt me and I dropped it.</font>

433
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:25,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Booyah!</font>

434
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:28,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how it's done!</font>

435
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:32,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</font>

436
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:34,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Todd...
- Woo-hoo!</font>

437
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:36,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling your mother.</font>

438
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

439
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:40,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always have an exit strategy.</font>

440
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:45,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've heard enough.</font>

441
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:48,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Kane, may we have
a sidebar in your office?</font>

442
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a mistrial.</font>

443
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:55,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give us a "C,"
give Todd a "C."</font>

444
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- What?</font>

445
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we take a sidebar
in this sidebar?</font>

446
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we're about
to get our "A."</font>

447
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Todd didn't do it.
- Um, he just confessed, dummy.</font>

448
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said the jar burned him?</font>

449
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:07,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't make any sense.</font>

450
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't half-confess
to crimes.</font>

451
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, when we started this,
you were after the truth.</font>

452
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I convinced you
it was more important to win.</font>

453
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:18,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be like me.</font>

454
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man's got to have a code.</font>

455
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:23,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only assume there is
a female equivalent to that.</font>

456
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A "codette" or something.
- But...</font>

457
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not worth getting an "A"</font>

458
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:30,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">if an innocent man
might get an "F."</font>

459
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I heard
all of that and I accept.</font>

460
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

461
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:41,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">After speaking to the wronged
parties, I've decided to...</font>

462
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, if it pleases
the bio class,</font>

463
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have closing arguments.</font>

464
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:48,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you do.</font>

465
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:53,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was it so hard
for all of us to grow a yam?</font>

466
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a stupid yam
in a stupid jar.</font>

467
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:02,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all fully-grown adults
failing a kindergarten project.</font>

468
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I object?
- I'll allow it.</font>

469
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:05,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sustained.</font>

470
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all this time we assumed
our yam was targeted,</font>

471
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">that someone had stomped
its roots maliciously.</font>

472
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if...
what if our yam's roots</font>

473
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">were dead before
they hit the ground?</font>

474
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, that's mine!
- Look at it.</font>

475
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:21,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone look.</font>

476
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smushed without
being stepped on.</font>

477
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it didn't
have to be stepped on.</font>

478
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it was boiled.</font>

479
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has been pouring boiling
water into our jars at night.</font>

480
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one noticed because the water
cooled off by morning.</font>

481
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:41,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boiling water is the icicle
stabbing of yam killing.</font>

482
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, but that didn't...</font>

483
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

484
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">This yam isn't boiled.</font>

485
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:49,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki?</font>

486
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't... I didn't
do it, I swear!</font>

487
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I boiled the yams.</font>

488
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki's yam never sprouted</font>

489
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I didn't want her to fail,
so I threw off the grading curve</font>

490
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">so she wouldn't have
to go to summer school</font>

491
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can finally have
sex in my parents' cabin.</font>

492
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">God forgive me,
I did it for love!</font>

493
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

494
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:10,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are definitely dissecting
pine cones next year.</font>

495
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neil has agreed to retake
biology over the summer</font>

496
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his status as
keymaster has been revoked.</font>

497
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all the politics
and procedure, in the end,</font>

498
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">the case really
was about biology.</font>

499
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told you it was
an important subject.</font>

500
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

501
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

502
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-Burns got rear-ended</font>

503
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:43,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the meth lab
in his trunk exploded.</font>

504
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

505
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:55,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed?
- Yeah?</font>

506
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we have
bunk bed conversations?</font>

507
00:19:57,677 --> 00:19:59,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

508
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're best friends,
we share a bunk bed.</font>

509
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like we should be
having them all the time.</font>

510
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You start.</font>

511
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Why do you think
they call them "bunk beds"?</font>

512
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the word "bunk"
come from?</font>

513
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

514
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it comes
from the word "bunker."</font>

515
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:16,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when is your apartment
done being fumigated?</font>

516
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it was done
about a week ago.</font>

517
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you still here?</font>

518
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:22,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I brought you some warm milk.
- Oh.</font>

519
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

520
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:27,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed,
off to Dreamland ♪</font>

521
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:31,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Catching the train
to Sleepytown ♪</font>

522
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ And when they wake up ♪</font>

523
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ The Dean'll be here ♪</font>

524
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Staring at you ♪</font>

525
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet deans.</font>

526
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice... I guess.</font>
