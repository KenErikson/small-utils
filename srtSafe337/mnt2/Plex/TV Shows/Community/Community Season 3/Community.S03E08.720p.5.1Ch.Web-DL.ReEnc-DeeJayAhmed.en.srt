00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did I come to Greendale?</font>

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can keep my job
and get busy with my education.</font>

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">To meet different people.</font>

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Greendale's
a slam dunk.</font>

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So why should you—
- Why should you—</font>

6
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:17,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should you go Greendale?</font>

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's easy.</font>

8
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale has
the most advanced typing class</font>

9
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:22,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the southwestern
Greendale area.</font>

10
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:25,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you can register
by fax.</font>

11
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:27,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!</font>

12
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, as you probably know,</font>

13
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the currently-running
commercial for our school.</font>

14
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I always see it
during late-night marathons</font>

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">of <i>Fantasy Island.</i></font>

16
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not an accident.</font>

17
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the result
of intensive targeting.</font>

18
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:40,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now,
Greendale's School board</font>

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">has given me a budget of
$2,000 to update our little ad.</font>

20
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure it should change?</font>

21
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:48,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I chose Greendale
over city college</font>

22
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:49,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the way
that one dude goes...</font>

23
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:52,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, okay, okay.</font>

24
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I love to be seen
agreeing with you, Troy.</font>

25
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:57,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is our chance to make</font>

26
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale's most reasonable
dreams come true.</font>

27
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I need your help—
All of you.</font>

28
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:04,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay, Jeffrey.</font>

29
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:05,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can say no.</font>

30
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">This school asks
very little of its students.</font>

31
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It mainly gives.</font>

32
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:12,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like you guys might know
what I'm talking about.</font>

33
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can we help?</font>

34
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks for asking.</font>

35
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've chosen you,
Greendale's brightest,</font>

36
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">most coincidentally diverse,
hispanics not withstanding,</font>

00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">study group to star
in our commercial.</font>

38
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh.

39
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:27,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">We start this weekend.</font>

40
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we get to be on tv!</font>

41
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we're shooting
this weekend,</font>

42
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">and film a documentary
instead of helping.</font>

43
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a student of character,
I have a feeling</font>

44
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">that trying to make
this commercial</font>

45
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:42,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">may cost the dean his sanity.</font>

46
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my camera follows
the fire, not the smoke.</font>

47
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:45,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever seen <i>Hearts of Darkness?</i></font>

48
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:47,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way better than <i>Apocalypse Now.</i></font>

49
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:49,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the catering sitch
going to be on this picture?</font>

50
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:50,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't Hollywood, Pierce.</font>

51
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it was, these glasses
would be tinted,</font>

52
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd be friends
with Stevie Nicks.</font>

53
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No catering.</font>

54
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is outrageous.</font>

55
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not leaving my trailer
till there's food.</font>

56
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:59,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a trailer.</font>

57
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:00,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then,
I'll rent a trailer.</font>

58
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:03,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I won't leave it till
I have the one I don't have.</font>

59
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an actor,
not a circus freak.</font>

60
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

61
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:08,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed to go that way.</font>

62
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:10,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, I'll loop around.</font>

00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">A script supervisor

<font color="#FFFFFF">that tells everyone

89
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're comfortable with that.</font>

90
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course.

91
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,471

92
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,144

93
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:28,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, the camera pans,

94
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,516

113

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a star is born.</font>

118
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:21,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggested to the dean

<font color="#FFFFFF">in front of
the Luis Guzman statue</font>

120
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the dean

<font color="#FFFFFF">to broadcast Guzman's image,</font>

122
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means every shot
will be unusable.</font>

123
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I even put a call in to
Guzman's lawyers to alert them.</font>

124
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:33,829

<font color="#FFFFFF">to avoid doing something.</font>

126
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,632

you smell like mentholyptus.</font>

128

129
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking about
breaking into the tv game.</font>

130
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since it's apparently
sticking around.</font>

131
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:46,925

in 30 years</font>

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying, I'd love
to be in your commercial.</font>

152
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wowee!</font>

153
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real big-time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.</font>

154
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:40,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wowee.</font>

155
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real big time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.</font>

156
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:43,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on down.
- Yeah, that's cool.</font>

157
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">But listen, I've got
to finish this movie,</font>

158
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:48,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, you know, I can't come for
a couple of weeks, all right?</font>

159
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Guzman, Luis,
thank you.</font>

160
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">And can I just say,</font>

161
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:54,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved you in—</font>

162
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:59,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Innnnnnnn...</font>

163
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">IMDb.</font>

164
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:04,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you soon, man.</font>

165
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was tragic.</font>

166
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:10,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">The students here mean well,
they really do.</font>

167
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what Greendale has
always needed is a miracle.</font>

168
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:15,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it.</font>

169
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how I get
to put Greendale on the map.</font>

170
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I thought this
commercial was going to be okay.</font>

171
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:20,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what?</font>

172
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:22,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just officially
became great.</font>

173
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me give you
a little rundown</font>

174
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:26,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">of this commercial's
great elements.</font>

175
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:30,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luis Guzman is in it.</font>

176
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, will you excuse me?</font>

177
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:37,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone gather 'round,
quick announcement.</font>

178
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:39,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on around.</font>

179
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:42,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything that we shot so far
is worthless.</font>

180
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've thrown it out,</font>

181
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're starting over
tomorrow morning.</font>

182
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Because...</font>

183
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:51,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luis Guzman
is in the commercial now, so...</font>

184
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. For realsies.</font>

185
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:57,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, go home.
I'm rewriting all of your parts.</font>

186
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for you, Jeffrey.</font>

187
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:01,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have locked
into something here.</font>

188
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:05,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only thing
your character needs</font>

189
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">is more screen time.</font>

190
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's great that
he got a celebrity,</font>

191
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:11,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but why reshoot everything?
- Perfectionism.</font>

192
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean's first step
down a road</font>

193
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">that ends
in self-destruction.</font>

194
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds...
Horrible.</font>

195
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I might end up
taking this to some festivals.</font>

196
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean's production has
taken over the entire school.</font>

197
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:30,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Classes are shut down.</font>

198
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">The quilting club is being
forced to sew costumes.</font>

199
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two females, both 5'10",</font>

200
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">one brunette, one with asthma.</font>

201
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's also using the P.A.
system for casting calls.</font>

202
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everyone—</font>

203
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does everyone have
their new script?</font>

204
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, it says I'm supposed to be
a book reading a book.</font>

205
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">That—that doesn't
make sense.</font>

206
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

207
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:55,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scene four.</font>

208
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, I had an epiphany.</font>

209
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready to step
this mother up a notch.</font>

210
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">This commercial is going
to push every button,</font>

211
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting with the one
that is so hot,</font>

212
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:05,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will sizzle
your finger—</font>

213
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">racccccce.</font>

214
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">And action.</font>

215
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To meet
different people."</font>

216
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut!
I'm coming in.</font>

217
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:21,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am trying to pull
a 400-year-old dagger</font>

218
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:27,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of this nation's heart,
and you two are hugging.</font>

219
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:29,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her, I understand, but you?</font>

220
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I do?</font>

221
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't.
Let's take it again!</font>

222
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To meet
different people."</font>

223
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again.</font>

224
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To meet
different people."</font>

225
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more!</font>

226
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">More!</font>

227
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong!
Fight the power!</font>

228
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:45,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight it with your hugs.</font>

229
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:48,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tear down those walls.</font>

230
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you get this wrong
one more time,</font>

231
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm segregating the school.</font>

232
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">"To meet different people."</font>

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't even do it
when we're helping you!</font>

234
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody help her!</font>

235
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">To meet different people!</font>

236
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop saying I'm different!</font>

237
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, we've spent
12 hours on this scene.</font>

238
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:08,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's time
to move on to something else.</font>

239
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in Psych 101, and even I
don't know what's happening.</font>

240
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean is going insane
and taking all of you with him.</font>

241
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:17,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you know that,
then do something!</font>

242
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing everything I can.
I only have so many cameras.</font>

243
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Aah!</font>

244
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:27,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent an entire day
in this thing for no reason.</font>

245
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the shoot drags on
for another day?</font>

246
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, God forbid, two.</font>

247
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">And action, and move.</font>

248
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:37,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">"This full-time mama
ain't breaking the bank—"</font>

249
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:39,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut—Garrett,</font>

250
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:42,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not taking advantage of
the motion capture technology.</font>

251
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:43,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to move.</font>

252
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:45,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot what I am again.</font>

253
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:48,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for crying out—
you are a microscope!</font>

254
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:50,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's a toilet.</font>

255
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's clearly a frog
who can't get out of a box.</font>

256
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff thinks he has it bad?</font>

257
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">As Jeff's understudy,
I have to wear my Jeff wig</font>

258
00:09:56,957 --> 00:10:00,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">on top of my Chang hair and
then my bald cap on top of that.</font>

259
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no air
getting through here.</font>

260
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:03,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm literally dying.</font>

261
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:06,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll never hear my story.</font>

262
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, now you heard it,
but... That was close.</font>

263
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you can't
work a little faster?</font>

264
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody asked for perfection.</font>

265
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, perfection
is what you're getting.</font>

266
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you don't like it,
you can fire me.</font>

267
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:17,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if we don't like it,</font>

268
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">at this point,
we definitely will fire you.</font>

269
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
That's how I like it. Ha!</font>

270
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surrounded by assassins.</font>

271
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">By own school's paper
has turned on me.</font>

272
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:29,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when this is all over,</font>

273
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have a commercial
with Luis Guzman in it,</font>

274
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all they'll have are
their words and their fears</font>

275
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">and whatever
embarrassing photos</font>

276
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">they can get from
my two-faced mother.</font>

277
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, I've got
two men in diapers here.</font>

278
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:42,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know one of them is playing</font>

279
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dawn of a new era
in education,</font>

280
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've got nothing
on the other one.</font>

281
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um,
just a guest of the dean's.</font>

282
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, both of you
go that way, then.</font>

283
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean had
his seventh epiphany today,</font>

284
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">which has given me
an epiphany of my own.</font>

285
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean is a genius.</font>

286
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has to be.</font>

287
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he isn't, I've given
almost two weeks of my life</font>

288
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">to an idiot.
That is unacceptable.</font>

289
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:04,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore the dean is a genius.</font>

290
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will die
protecting his vision.</font>

291
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you by any chance familiar
with Stockholm Syndrome?</font>

292
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:11,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it something
that the dean created?</font>

293
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if not, I don't care.</font>

294
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:15,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all wanna go,
but the dean won't let us.</font>

295
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:17,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Pierce played this
the smartest from the beginning.</font>

296
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's probably at home
watching <i>Forensic Files</i></font>

297
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">and eating cheesy popcorn.</font>

298
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, about time.</font>

299
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:30,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's for Luis Guzman.</font>

300
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:34,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when you get me
my trailer, he can have it back.</font>

301
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make it
as nice as this one.</font>

302
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:39,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dean.
Dean? Hey, Dean!</font>

303
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce mistook me
for the dean today.</font>

304
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:44,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want windows.
- How did that make you feel?</font>

305
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've become
a stranger to myself.</font>

306
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:50,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bald now.
I've always been bald.</font>

307
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I merely dreamt of having hair.</font>

308
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now the bald man is awake.</font>

309
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff?</font>

310
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.</font>

311
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:05,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lights, camera, Dean.</font>

312
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Action.</font>

313
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why go Greendale?
Just because!</font>

314
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut.
Cut.</font>

315
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lose the bald cap.</font>

316
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I don't like it.</font>

317
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hokey, it's fake.</font>

318
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:23,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it off.</font>

319
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

320
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon, actor?</font>

321
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:36,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have worn this stupid thing
for 12 days.</font>

322
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have made bald friends.</font>

323
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's your mistake.</font>

324
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's a lie.
It's Hollywood crap.</font>

325
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:44,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I won't allow it
in my commercial.</font>

326
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not bald.</font>

327
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.</font>

328
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, you're wrong
for the part!</font>

329
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understudy!</font>

330
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

331
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's reality.</font>

332
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger, you're done.
Go home.</font>

333
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go home.</font>

334
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I don't know why,
but this is the last straw.</font>

335
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a licensed psychology major,</font>

336
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:17,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am declaring this production
a violation of human rights.</font>

337
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have made us prisoners
of your insanity.</font>

338
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut your face, Britta.</font>

339
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the dean wants his role</font>

340
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:27,383

in a blond wig—</font>

341
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you are insane.</font>

342
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm sick and tired</font>

343
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:32,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">of hearing complaints</font>

344
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'm forcing people
to be here.</font>

345
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:39,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone who doesn't want
to help me can leave!</font>

346
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, stop!
- Okay.</font>

347
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,941

353
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I've been editing.</font>

354
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a ltle bit of a mess.</font>

355
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the is that?</font>

356
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's a possum.</font>

357
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you spend
some time with them,</font>

358
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:44,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">you see they're just like
big, gentle rats.</font>

359
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's the guy?
- I'm no one.</font>

360
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Abed.
He's a little bit odd.</font>

361
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:51,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, without further ado,</font>

362
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">here is the commercial
you will be staring in.</font>

363
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I go Greendale?</font>

364
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- What's in the box?</font>

365
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh... Oh...</font>

366
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:14,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got to make a phone call.</font>

367
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to tell this dean
I couldn't do his commercial.</font>

368
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't take that
too well either.</font>

369
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all gotta help this dude.</font>

370
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:22,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, aren't you his friends?</font>

371
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more of a fly on the wall.</font>

372
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:26,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is go—</font>

373
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">what?</font>

374
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't be in my commercial,</font>

375
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:32,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you'll be in
his stupid documentary?</font>

376
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he does
is follow people around.</font>

377
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but haven't you seen
<i>Hearts of Darkness?</i></font>

378
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Way better than—
- I want you</font>

379
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">the hell off of my campus,
you ungrateful backstabber.</font>

380
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already got rid
of your trailer.</font>

381
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a trailer?</font>

382
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can anyone hear me?</font>

383
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will walk off
this production.</font>

384
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will quit!
Hello?</font>

385
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come here to shoot
this commercial for Greendale.</font>

386
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you had
written on the script.</font>

387
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, that script was terrible.</font>

388
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was pretty good.</font>

389
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you'd think that.</font>

390
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went here.</font>

391
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:04,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I get it.</font>

392
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:07,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're worse than crazy.</font>

393
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're ashamed of your school.</font>

394
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that—that statue
of me out there,</font>

395
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's just wrong, man.</font>

396
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the bronze
adds ten pounds.</font>

397
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nah, man—
- It's not going to be perfect.</font>

398
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you.</font>

399
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying, don't worship
the people leaving Greendale.</font>

400
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worship the people
that are here.</font>

401
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worship this place.
It changes people's life.</font>

402
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:29,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.</font>

403
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:31,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's way before
<i>Boogie Nights</i> too.</font>

404
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:35,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this is a special school.</font>

405
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:40,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't deserve to be here.</font>

406
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still filming, Abed?</font>

407
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but try not
to address me.</font>

408
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not really here.</font>

409
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither am I.</font>

410
00:16:56,016 --> 00:17:00,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I can finish
my commercial.</font>

411
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think I know
how your documentary ends.</font>

412
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:08,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Craig Pelton,</font>

413
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean of Greendale
Community College.</font>

414
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have failed this school.</font>

415
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have failed it
because I thought</font>

416
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was better than Greendale.</font>

417
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I went to a university,</font>

418
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I thought it was my job
to improve this place.</font>

419
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it turns out that the only
thing wrong with Greendale</font>

420
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that it's run by
an insecure wreck</font>

421
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">who holds five dances
and two talent shows a year</font>

422
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he's afraid that
the school isn't good enough.</font>

423
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Greendale is good enough</font>

424
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it accepts me
for what I'm not.</font>

425
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is the best school
in the entire world,</font>

426
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:47,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm so sorry
what I've done to it.</font>

427
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:50,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm sorry what I've done
to the ice cream machine.</font>

428
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

429
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, no one eat out of it
until you clean the nozzles.</font>

430
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:00,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">The janitor knows how.</font>

431
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm horrible.</font>

432
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm horrible.</font>

433
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, what I'm about
to show you</font>

434
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:12,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not the commercial
you paid me to create.</font>

435
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I am about to show you</font>

436
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a glimpse into
my mind and soul.</font>

437
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please hold your questions
until the end.</font>

438
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:18,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you will have
a lot of them,</font>

439
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll understand
if you'd rather I just leave.</font>

440
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I go Greendale?</font>

441
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean is a genius.</font>

442
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">To meet different people.</font>

443
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">With three kids at home,</font>

444
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">you better believe
every penny counts.</font>

445
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.</font>

446
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:39,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why should you—</font>

447
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:40,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should you—</font>

448
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:42,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should you
go to Greendale?</font>

449
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is the best school
in the entire world.</font>

450
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!</font>

451
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:53,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good.</font>

452
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-you know what,
better than good.</font>

453
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:55,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good enough.</font>

454
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any more
of the crazy Chinese guy?</font>

455
00:18:58,255 --> 00:18:59,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">He pops.</font>

456
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm confused.
That's not my commercial.</font>

457
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I didn't make that.</font>

458
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, okay, Zemeckis,
it moved through you.</font>

459
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, congratulations.</font>

460
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should last us
another 16 years.</font>

461
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, what's next?</font>

462
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chump's rusty bucket?
- Quarter taps.</font>

463
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you do this?
- You did mostly.</font>

464
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got the footage
you needed on the first day.</font>

465
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:28,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I added a little bit of
my footage to fill in the gaps.</font>

466
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:30,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were
a fly on the wall.</font>

467
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:32,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some flies are too awesome
for the wall.</font>

468
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:34,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Documentarians are supposed
to be objective,</font>

469
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">to avoid having
any effect on the story.</font>

470
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet we have more effect
than anyone.</font>

471
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we decide to tell it.</font>

472
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we decide how it ends.</font>

473
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will your story be
yet another sad one</font>

474
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">of yet another man
who just wanted to be happy?</font>

475
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:48,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or will your story acknowledge
the very nature of stories</font>

476
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">and embrace the fact
that sharing the sad ones</font>

477
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">can sometimes make them happy?</font>

478
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

479
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you say anything...</font>

480
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:57,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope, I've got nothing.</font>

481
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you just forgive me?</font>

482
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:05,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

483
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

484
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we've all been there.</font>

485
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why we're all here.</font>

486
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:21,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww!</font>

487
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a good Dean?</font>

488
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

489
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can someone help me get
a live possum out of my office?</font>

490
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:30,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could do that.</font>

491
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just keeps jumping
and skittering.</font>

492
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think you're prepared,
and then it skitters again.</font>

493
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:39,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, scene's over.</font>

494
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

495
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,478

496
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be ready for you
in 20 minutes, Mr. Garlin.</font>

497
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

498
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:58,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a star!</font>

499
00:20:58,372 --> 00:20:59,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that.</font>

500
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:02,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not be mitigated.</font>

501
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:08,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know what?</font>

502
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not coming out of
this trailer</font>

503
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I get a new trailer.</font>

504
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get me
a granola bar!</font>
