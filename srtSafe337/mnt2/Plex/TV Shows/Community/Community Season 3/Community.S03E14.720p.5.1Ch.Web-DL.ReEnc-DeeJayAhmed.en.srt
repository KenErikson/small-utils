<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes.</font>

432
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,135

you have to be.</font>

435
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might be interested.</font>

436
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then.</font>

437
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:48,442

00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,113

442
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:58,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
I'll go get them.</font>

443

<font color="#FFFFFF">he had gone back to the office.</font>

446
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a nice touch.</font>

447
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

448
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky no one grabbed them, huh?</font>

449
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,759

00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accidentally while trying
to get a picture of the light</font>

452
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">hitting a stack
of nearby waffles.</font>

454
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hear you!
Your cheeks are in the way.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">First entry
in my stupid journal.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Today I had to run and get
two imaginary Friendship Hats</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">from an office.</font>

458
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could've just walked
around the corner</font>

459
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the come back,
but for some reason,</font>

460
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:42,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually went
all the way back</font>

461
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">to where they were
supposed to be.</font>

462
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:46,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">One was crumpled up a bit.
That was Troy's.</font>

463
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other was just a little
dusty. That was Abed's.</font>

464
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fixed them up even though
I was the only one watching</font>

465
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I settled on
a truth today</font>

466
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's always going to be true.</font>

467
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would do anything
for my friends,</font>

468
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I think is how everyone
in the world feels,</font>

469
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:03,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">which finally makes me
understand war.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys...</font>

471
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't going
to show this to anyone,</font>

472
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh, it's pretty profound.</font>

473
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kind of nailed it.</font>

474
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want, I can read it
in the documentary.</font>

475
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is,
unless you get Tom Hanks.</font>

476
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried to get Tom Hanks,</font>

477
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's too expensive.</font>

478
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we used the people involved
for their own voiceover.</font>

479
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I nailed that too.</font>

480
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here
at the same time as me?</font>

481
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:27,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tight schedule.</font>

482
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:31,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, were you in The Cape?
- No.</font>

483
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

484
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- I've got goosebumps.</font>

485
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:36,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.
Such a great story.</font>

486
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on the edge of my seat,
and I was in it.</font>

487
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know what
struck me while I was watching</font>

488
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that marvelous documentary?
- Hmm?</font>

489
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't get quality
programming like that</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Folks, we know you hate
these constant pledge drives.</font>

498
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you hate them.
We don't love doing them.</font>

499
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:00,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't like
doing them either.</font>

500
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:02,332

- Mm-hmm.</font>
