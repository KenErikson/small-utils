00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we'll figure it out.</font>

things out,</font>

40
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably the monkey
that lives in the vents.</font>

a screwup this year.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Britta.</font>

48
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

49
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're really doing this
without Pierce?</font>

50
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sad.</font>

51
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we have parted ways
with our closest,</font>

52
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">oldest, craziest,
most racist, oldest,</font>

53

<font color="#FFFFFF">elderly, crazy friend,
and he's not coming back.</font>

54
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm back.</font>

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was your summer?</font>

56
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enlightful, Annie.</font>

57
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I underwent three months
of intensive soul-rezoning</font>

58
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the laser lotus
celebrity center.</font>

59
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:24,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stand before you a more
highly evolved Pierce Hawthorne,</font>

60
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">one that can accept
that this table has a—</font>

61
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">has a sort of magic in it.</font>

62
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

63
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd like to come back.</font>

64
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Damn it!</font>

65
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, sorry.</font>

66
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had
the frustrating realization</font>

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you can't come back
to the group,</font>

68
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're not in biology
and it's all filled up.</font>

69
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, couldn't we take
something else?</font>

70
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, surely we've
evolved beyond</font>

71
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">caring what class
we take together.</font>

72
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah.
- Pierce!</font>

73
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do you one better.</font>

74
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:58,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we've evolved beyond
reliance on a group at all.</font>

75
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't we just actual friends
now, no matter where we are?</font>

76
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what's magic
about this table?</font>

77
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">It magically keeps our books
from falling on the floor.</font>

78
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">The table's for studying,
but as friends, we've evolved.</font>

79
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let's use that first breath</font>

super evolved air</font>

all over me.</font>

150
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, w-we could seal
all the vents</font>

151
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then pump the ducts
with some kind of gas</font>

152
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">that knocks out monkeys.</font>

153
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monkey knockout gas!</font>

154
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that's the kind of grounded,
sensible thinking</font>

155
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see this year.</font>

156
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:52,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Catherine, who's next?</font>

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vice Dean Laybourne,</font>

158
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the air conditioning
repair school annex.</font>

159
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vice Dean.</font>

160
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean.
New suit, Dean?</font>

161
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">New Dean, vice Dean.
New Dean.</font>

162
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see that you
used school funds</font>

163
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">to buy an espresso machine
for your faculty break room.</font>

164
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't recall
being consulted on that.</font>

165
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't consult you
on anything.</font>

166
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the problem.</font>

167
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">The air-conditioning repair
school annex seems to think.</font>

168
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it's separate
from Greendale,</font>

169
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's an annex.</font>

170
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">An appendage, on a body,
with a head,</font>

171
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this head is saying
to this appendage,</font>

172
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">"whazup?"</font>

173
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you say makes sense, Dean.</font>

174
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what.</font>

175
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bring your head down
to my appendage tomorrow,</font>

176
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll show you
"whazup."</font>

177
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be there.</font>

178
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I found something
that will help Abed!</font>

179
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, did you know
that Cougar Town</font>

180
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:05,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">is an American adaptation
of a 1990s British sitcom?</font>

181
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cougarton abbey.</font>

182
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just been 'round
Cougarton chapel.</font>

183
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be having an awakening.</font>

184
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come off it, Deidre.</font>

185
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've only been having
a butchers at the choir boys.</font>

186
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than nothing.
Thanks, Britta.</font>

187
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe that guy,</font>

188
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">kicking me out of class
like that?</font>

189
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be impossible
to find a science class</font>

190
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">with six open spots.</font>

191
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would we need to do that?</font>

192
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm not in biology
anymore.</font>

193
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">And neither is Pierce,</font>

194
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're both
still our friends.</font>

195
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've evolved.</font>

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Jeff?</font>

197
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we have.</font>

198
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And we all love each other.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

199
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we all go
to the same school, so, uh...</font>

200
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'll see ya
when I see ya.</font>

201
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guess what.</font>

202
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on the wait list
for biology,</font>

203
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">somebody got kicked out,
I am—</font>

204
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here to study!</font>

205
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!</font>

206
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">All hail, sir eats alone.</font>

207
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Leonard.</font>

208
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard about
your prescription socks.</font>

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope you don't mind, Jeff,</font>

210
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've got
a new favorite show,</font>

211
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm only on episode six.</font>

212
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys got about
five minutes left to eat.</font>

213
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my, time flies when you're
studying the science of life.</font>

214
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think time flies
when you're joking around</font>

215
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">about movie titles that sound
like names for poops.</font>

216
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remains of the day.</font>

217
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second.</font>

218
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you eavesdropping
on our study session?</font>

219
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was eavesdropping
on your goof-off session,</font>

220
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you dummies missed
the most obvious one.</font>

221
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I said,
"Green Mile."</font>

222
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Operation dumbo drop!</font>

223
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ew!
- Gross!</font>

224
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too clever by half, Jeffrey.</font>

225
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well uh, I gotta go.</font>

226
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the five minutes.</font>

227
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:51,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, Jeffrey.</font>

228
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey. The barrister's
foreclosed the abbey.</font>

229
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:57,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fancy a drink, then?</font>

230
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:01,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oi, fetch us a hemlock.</font>

231
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

232
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um—
- Britta?</font>

233
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did everyone
on Cougarton Abbey just die?</font>

234
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">They only ran six episodes.</font>

235
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the great thing about
British tv.</font>

236
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">They give you closure.</font>

237
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no!</font>

238
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find you
a new favorite show!</font>

239
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:26,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find you
a new favorite show!</font>

240
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:30,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, buddy.</font>

241
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are human tennis elbow.</font>

242
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a pizza burn on the roof
of the world's mouth.</font>

243
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the opposite of Batman.</font>

244
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't need them, man.</font>

245
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.
I'll see 'em when I see 'em.</font>

246
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

247
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I, we should
hang out some time, huh?</font>

248
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:50,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab a drink?</font>

249
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.
Where are you living now?</font>

250
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">The air vents.</font>

251
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live in the air vents
of the school. Shhhh!</font>

252
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:04,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm free, Jeff. Free!</font>

253
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta get back in that class.</font>

254
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:12,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real Dean coming through—
Oh, my goodness spacious,</font>

255
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:14,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">vice dean...</font>

256
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this where Greendale's money
is going?</font>

257
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">More accurately, Dean,</font>

258
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's where Greendale's money
comes from.</font>

259
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:23,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our air-conditioning program
has a job placement rate</font>

260
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">five times higher than the rest
of your school combined.</font>

261
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our alumnini donations
comprise 80%</font>

262
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your entire school's budget.</font>

263
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you want to know why
we think we deserve</font>

264
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">an espresso machine?</font>

265
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:39,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess
I didn't know. I—</font>

266
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you never had to, Dean.
You could have lived</font>

267
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rest of your life
in blissful ignorance</font>

268
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">and died a happy,
pansexual imp.</font>

269
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you wanted
to feel power this year.</font>

270
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now, you're going
to feel my power</font>

271
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:57,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">as it surges downward from me,
straight through you,</font>

272
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:02,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">from nostril to rectum,
now until the end of time.</font>

273
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:05,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's "whazup."</font>

274
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot everything you said
before "rectum"!</font>

275
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these guys?</font>

276
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my legal team
because I think it's time</font>

277
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:17,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">we worked out a new agreement.</font>

278
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't look like a lawyer.</font>

279
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a barber.</font>

280
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:23,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm also sick
of that ridiculous goatee.</font>

281
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:26,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like
a white Lou Gossett, Jr.</font>

282
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserve a bigger office.</font>

283
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biggest office I ever had.</font>

284
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to apologize,
Dr. King,</font>

285
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">and beg you for a seat
in biology.</font>

286
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you what, 'N Sync,
you wanna learn about life?</font>

287
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give up the phone.</font>

288
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. You're asking me
for a bribe?</font>

289
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be bought, man.
You feel me?</font>

290
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, prison was my walls.</font>

291
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you put your walls up.</font>

292
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, and your phone,
and your attitude,</font>

293
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your fruit loops cologne.</font>

294
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your walls put up so tight, man,</font>

295
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:00,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">not even a blade of grass
could get through.</font>

296
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">But even if it did,
you wouldn't appreciate it.</font>

297
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you can't
come back to my class.</font>

298
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your problem
with me, man?</font>

299
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:11,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't act like it's not
about me specifically</font>

300
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:14,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you've been in—</font>

301
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:19,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Busted!</font>

302
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Take it easy, Winger.</font>

303
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything okay?</font>

304
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is now that I have this.</font>

305
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:31,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my ticket
to getting back in the group.</font>

306
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey!</font>

307
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:39,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be
in the group so bad!</font>

308
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:47,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's smoke 'em
and choke 'em.</font>

309
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! N-n-n—</font>

310
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh!
What is that?</font>

311
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:56,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monkey gas!</font>

312
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monkey gas?</font>

313
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:05,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my g—</font>

314
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

315
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">All your friends are here.</font>

316
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanna talk to you.</font>

317
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

318
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is this different
from the way he always is?</font>

319
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to push it,</font>

320
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this would be a great time
to baptize him.</font>

321
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, maybe this can be
your new favorite show.</font>

322
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:53,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a British Sci-Fi series</font>

323
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's been on the air
since 1962.</font>

324
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you've done enough,
okay?</font>

325
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go start
a ruiners' club?</font>

326
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh wait, you'd probably
just ruin it.</font>

327
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then,
I'd be doing a good job</font>

328
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's a ruiners' club.</font>

329
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ruined my analogy.</font>

330
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, look!</font>

331
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey, inspector!</font>

332
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have we wound up
this time?</font>

333
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:23,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question isn't where,
constable, but when.</font>

334
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector, look out!
Blorgons!</font>

335
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:28,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eradicate! Eradicate!</font>

336
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the best show I've
ever seen in my entire life.</font>

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having fun without me again?</font>

338
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, what happened?
You look 70.</font>

339
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed has
a new favorite tv show, Jeff.</font>

340
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called
Inspector Spacetime—</font>

341
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can it, boobs.
I came here to let you know</font>

342
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:49,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your best friend Pierce
is the one that got me</font>

343
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">kicked out of bio class
and the study group.</font>

344
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a plan he hatched
from the beginning</font>

345
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">with his pal, Professor Kane.</font>

346
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:03,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Jeff, that's a photo
I gave our professor</font>

347
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:07,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">of me visiting Hawthorne Wipes'
spokesman and rap artist</font>

348
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sugar Cube in prison
during the '90s.</font>

349
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, th-th-they look alike.</font>

350
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I guess they share one
important feature in your eyes.</font>

351
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not fair!</font>

352
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I-I-I-I
was standing far away,</font>

353
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I saw the prison uniform!</font>

354
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey!</font>

355
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, obviously
I don't mean</font>

356
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">all black people are in prison!</font>

357
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

358
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, clearly you have gone
off the deep end.</font>

359
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:32,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't blame him.</font>

360
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">The table is powerful,
and being cut off from it—</font>

361
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:38,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the—</font>

362
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:45,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've become...
Agitated.</font>

363
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize.</font>

364
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll continue this discourse
at a later date.</font>

365
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

366
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:55,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just needs some space.</font>

367
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill
the one thing you love!</font>

368
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill it!</font>

369
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:07,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as it breathes,
it controls our lives!</font>

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just came by to tell everyone</font>

371
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:15,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">this year isn't gonna be
that different.</font>

372
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:20,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the notable exception,
we really won't have any money.</font>

373
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice night.</font>

374
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is with that guy?</font>

375
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:32,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you find the monkey?</font>

376
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but here's the invoice
for the gassing.</font>

377
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:38,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, as it turns out,
I cannot pay this...</font>

378
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:41,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or your salaries starting on...
Two weeks ago.</font>

379
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, what I do have are
these vouchers</font>

380
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the classes
of your choosing.</font>

381
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky I need
my scuba certification.</font>

382
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

383
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one
living in your vents.</font>

384
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no home and no job.</font>

385
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:17,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that mean you'll work
for room and board?</font>

386
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:25,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I was lying
the whole time.</font>

387
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want the group
to evolve.</font>

388
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't want Pierce
around. I hate him.</font>

389
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:36,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but Jeff, what you did—
it's hard to get past that.</font>

390
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're already out
of the study group,</font>

391
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:40,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna have to ask that
you stop being my friend.</font>

392
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look, everybody,
here's the thing,</font>

393
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not as evolved
as I said I was.</font>

394
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">The biology class was full,
so I told Professor Kane</font>

395
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd pay him
a few thousand dollars to...</font>

396
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:56,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">K-kick Jeff out.</font>

397
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Pierce!</font>

398
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

399
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe Jeff attacked
a table with a fire axe</font>

400
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">and still only managed to be the
second craziest man in the room.</font>

401
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everybody in favor of
voting Pierce out of the group?</font>

402
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Stop!</font>

403
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce isn't crazy.</font>

404
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">The table...</font>

405
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is... Magic.</font>

406
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">As someone who's been
on the other side,</font>

407
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you,</font>

408
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is a scary, lonely,
Chang-filled world out there,</font>

409
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sure, this group has
sprouted some legs,</font>

410
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:31,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">but why are we in such a rush
to leave the tide pool,</font>

411
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the only things
waiting for us on shore</font>

412
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the sands of time.</font>

413
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the hungry seagulls
of slowly growing apart.</font>

414
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I really need this
biology class.</font>

415
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!</font>

416
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Kane has never taken
a bribe from anyone in his life.</font>

417
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel me?</font>

418
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I lied, but you seem
to have a harder time</font>

419
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">being the bad guy than me.</font>

420
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. I do...</font>

421
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, in a weird way,
makes me a pretty bad guy.</font>

422
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:09,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're one and the same.</font>

423
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't.</font>

424
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, but you're still
kicked out of biology.</font>

425
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm not worried about it.</font>

426
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life has a way
of breaking through.</font>

427
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, here's what
I'm thinking.</font>

428
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a drug dealer, right?
And you're a scientist,</font>

429
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">so couldn't we get, like,</font>

430
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Breaking Bad
type of thing going?</font>

431
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:34,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, star-face, you just
lost your seat in my class.</font>

432
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, now the table
is good as new.</font>

433
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:42,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so is Abed.</font>

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I'm sorry I was
overprotective about it.</font>

435
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try and be more supportive
of you.</font>

436
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's your first chance.</font>

437
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helping Abed has inspired me
to finally declare a major.</font>

438
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:53,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna study Psychology.</font>

439
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:55,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like in a research capacity?</font>

440
00:20:55,567 --> 00:21:00,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, in a hands-on capacity.
I'm gonna be a therapist.</font>

441
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

442
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.</font>

443
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a new sheriff in town.</font>

444
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:16,528
