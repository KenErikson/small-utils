00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's yours.</font>

299
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the Dreamatorium
really works.</font>

300
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe Leonard was watching
from the bushes</font>

301
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">and told Abed about it.</font>

302
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have cable.</font>

303
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock it off, Abed.</font>

304
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:23,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Abed.</font>

305
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're confused, so was I.</font>

306
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not anymore.</font>

307
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff...
Abed, stop!</font>

308
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:31,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna do this.</font>

309
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to talk to Abed.</font>

310
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:38,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking the file.</font>

311
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it says Abed
is in the recovery parlor.</font>

312
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Condition... never better.</font>

313
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not holding anything.</font>

314
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the file.</font>

315
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed Nadir,
psychiatric patient 1373,</font>

316

319
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's out of context.</font>

320
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

321
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've thought
of everything, Annie.</font>

322
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Abed gone
and Troy and Britta together,</font>

323
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:15,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing standing
in the way of us.</font>

324
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

325
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

326
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is you dream.</font>

327
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why you
played matchmaker.</font>

328
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:24,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what's important to you.</font>

329
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not Jeff.</font>

330
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Jeff cares about Abed.</font>

331
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I did not push
Troy and Britta together</font>

332
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:32,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">so this would happen.</font>

333
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it because I thought
they were cute together</font>

334
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:36,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this would
have been a bonus.</font>

335
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:38,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are not here.</font>

336
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not staying here because
I hate whoever you are.</font>

337
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should probably
storm off in...</font>

338
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:44,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

339
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">In place.</font>

340
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you wanna go next?</font>

341
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be alone.</font>

342
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds good to me.</font>

343
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Execute simulation,
Annie/Annie.</font>

344
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

345
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:09,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're alone.</font>

346
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, so you're me now.</font>

347
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you blowing
our magic moment with Jeff?</font>

348
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not magic.</font>

349
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not even real.</font>

350
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:19,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we love Jeff.</font>

351
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we don't.</font>

352
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just in love
with the idea of being loved.</font>

353
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we can teach a guy
like Jeff to do it,</font>

354
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll never be unloved.</font>

355
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:32,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we keep running the same
scenario over and over</font>

356
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:33,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">hoping for a different result.</font>

358
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful now.</font>

359
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're starting
to sound like Abed.</font>

367
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

368
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:57,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

369
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find you guilty of being Abed.</font>

370
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're under arrest!</font>

371
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,150

the hell's going on?</font>

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time you'll never get out.</font>

374
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

375

376
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:20,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

377
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,470

Cool, cool, cool.</font>

in junior high.</font>

the square footage.</font>

385
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a metaphorical locker.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we got snowboarding
in the Olympics</font>

405

that with all of us,</font>

433
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,276

mutton, we are.</font>

449
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if I can help it.</font>

450
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:59,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you on the other side
inspector... Wherever that is.</font>

451
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you mean
"whenever that is"?</font>

452
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that, Blorgon scum!</font>

453
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:11,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll blo-gon me
for this later.</font>

454
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, Annie!</font>

455
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, my God!</font>

456
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I'm so sorry.</font>

457
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, you're committing.</font>

458
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:18,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is good stuff.</font>

459
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

460
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Abed Nadir...</font>

461
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know a lot of things
everyone else knows.</font>

462
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wander the universe
with my friend, Troy,</font>

463
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">doing whatever I want.</font>

464
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:32,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes accidentally hurting
innocent unremarkables.</font>

465
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:36,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">This week, however, Troy went
to lunch and I adapted.</font>

466
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:39,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I now have the ability
to enter the minds of others.</font>

467
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:41,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm hungry, are you hungry?
- Yeah.</font>

468
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make us buttered noodles.</font>

469
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:46,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using an elusive new
technique known as "empathy".</font>

470
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:50,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">So was the other fast food
place worth the drive, Shirley?</font>

471
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, half way there I
thought, "What am I doing?</font>

472
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same fast food place
in a different location.</font>

473
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have the margins of my life
become so narrow?"</font>

474
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:58,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I went to the mall
and had pizza.</font>

475
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like this has been a
game-changing day for all of us.</font>

476
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost sat on my balls,</font>

477
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">but at the last second,
I made an adjustment.</font>

478
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good job!
- Good work.</font>

479
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job, man.</font>

480
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we had a good lunch, too.</font>

481
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

482
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,089
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I spoke to the manager
about Die Hard,</i></font>

483
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I told him he should be
ashamed of himself.</font>

484
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

485
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I bailed
on the Dreamatorium.</font>

486
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:26,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, Annie did pretty
good in a pinch.</font>

487
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, back to cramming?</font>

488
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people at the bank loved
my outfit.</font>

489
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they had all kinds of
questions about it</font>

490
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my answers seemed to amuse</font>

491
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">and... and even liberate
them a little.</font>

492
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few of us went to lunch</font>

493
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I had the deepest
conversation of my life.</font>

494
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:48,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go,
I'm telling everybody.</font>

495
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, maybe after
a long, dark night,</font>

496
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sun is starting
to rise on Greendale.</font>

497
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe. Maybe not.</font>

498
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never can tell what kind
of day you're gonna have.</font>

499
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:00,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I didn't really avoid
sitting on them.</font>

500
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sat right on them.</font>

501
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Aw.</font>

502
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Pierce, I'm sorry.</font>

503
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurt like hell.</font>

504
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:08,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw eagles.</font>

505
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed
in the morning ♪</font>

506
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:14,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we're joined
by Annie Edison...</font>

507
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi!
- Who's gonna show us how</font>

508
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">to spruce up your
apartment on a budget.</font>

509
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Annie, what
inspired this throw?</font>

510
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just thought
that I'd cover up the stain</font>

511
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Abed spilled code red
on the couch last week.</font>

512
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops. Crafty.</font>

513
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you have some tips
on entertaining.</font>

514
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, if you're
expecting company,</font>

515
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't have enough
chairs, you can bring out</font>

516
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">pillows from your bedroom and
use them on the floor</font>

517
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a Moroccan feel.</font>

518
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, a taste of the Orient.
- Ooh!</font>

519
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, boys, I have
a little surprise for you.</font>

520
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-oh.
- While you two were out</font>

521
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">playing blazer tag...</font>

522
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's laser tag
with sport coats.</font>

523
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did a little extreme
bedroom makeover!</font>

524
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I unbunked your beds and got
scrap fabric and...</font>

525
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, buddy.</font>

526
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can put it back.</font>

527
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:55,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can put it back
the way it was.</font>

528
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:56,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

529
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... cut, Garrett.</font>
