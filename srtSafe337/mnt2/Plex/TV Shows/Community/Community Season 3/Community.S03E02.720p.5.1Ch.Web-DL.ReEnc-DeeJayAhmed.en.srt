00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another point goes to red team.</font>

297
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How is this still happening?
- Can't remember the smell of true air.</font>

298
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do something or we're gonna lose.</font>

299
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is important to Annie.</font>

300
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">So whoever actually died
a few months ago, 'fess up</font>

301
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can put a stake
through your heart.</font>

302
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lesson here is that a model U.N.,
much like the real,</font>

303
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">quickly falls apart when faced...</font>

304
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:00,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the lesson here
is that I need to win this!</font>

305
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:02,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to win!</font>

306
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you!</font>

307
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suck!</font>

308
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a stupid, ugly poopface!</font>

309
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm better than you!</font>

310
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're acting like a little schoolgirl
and not in a hot way.</font>

311
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">That made me sound creepy.</font>

312
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here's the thing.</font>

313
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me.</font>

314
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">If embarrassment
were bountiful zinc deposits,</font>

315
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be Zambia.</font>

316
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to be Zambia about,
Annie.</font>

317
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all my fault,</font>

318
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pushed you
into competing with other Annie.</font>

319
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?
I practically ran to you with the flier.</font>

320
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to destroy her.</font>

321
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:06,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't handle the thought of anyone
getting more gold stars than me.</font>

322
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm such a child.</font>

323
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:10,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not.</font>

324
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:15,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you really hate someone
the way you hate Annie Kim,</font>

325
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:18,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">or when you feel
the way I feel about you,</font>

326
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">the easy loophole through...</font>

327
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:24,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">the creepiness and danger
is to treat them like a child.</font>

328
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A chip off the old block,
you're the best, kiddo."</font>

329
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a crutch.</font>

330
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a way for me to tell you
how important you are...</font>

331
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:33,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a distance.</font>

332
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now you're becoming this...</font>

333
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">mature, self-possessed,
intelligent young woman,</font>

334
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't keep patting you
on the head or talking down to you.</font>

335
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I like how close we are.</font>

336
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to grow up
if it means losing what we have.</font>

337
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, tough, Annie.</font>

338
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to grow up,
the world needs more women like you.</font>

339
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't keep doing this forever, kiddo.</font>

340
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we?</font>

341
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:04,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't, no.
- That's gross, that feels gross.</font>

342
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I better go check on the group.</font>

343
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless they left.</font>

344
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll follow you.
From a respectable distance.</font>

345
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:18,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

346
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I put you through that.</font>

347
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know it doesn't make up,</font>

348
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:23,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">but...</font>

349
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">would it help if I said I farted?</font>

350
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you
fall on that sword because...</font>

351
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I farted.
- No, I farted.</font>

352
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I farted.</font>

353
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wasn't doing the <i>Spartacus</i> thing.
- I farted.</font>

354
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, seriously...
- We all farted.</font>

355
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys!</font>

356
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:45,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm farting now.</font>

357
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still here?</font>

358
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed may have figured out
a way we can still win.</font>

359
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really? How?
- It's simple, really. First we...</font>

360
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you?
You can't just mumble nonsense.</font>

361
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:00,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No one's cutting away.
- Fine, here's my actual plan.</font>

362
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:20,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that?
- It's from Britta.</font>

363
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's promising
to disrupt the model U.N.</font>

364
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says
she's gonna cause a disruption that,</font>

365
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">while not completely illegal,
should be a real concern</font>

366
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:31,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">to campus security!</font>

367
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should call the real cops.</font>

368
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, back in the '80s,
I had this real piece of work protestor,</font>

369
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">used to always give me trouble.</font>

370
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what happened to her?</font>

371
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">She incited a riot at the W.T.O.</font>

372
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got choked until she passed out.</font>

373
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:52,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">By some real cop.</font>

374
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a real billyclub.</font>

375
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I wonder, you know?</font>

376
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?</font>

377
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go show that hippie
how the world works.</font>

378
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you forgetting something?</font>

379
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">All in favor?</font>

380
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aye?
- Could you morons say aye any slower?</font>

381
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Greetings, people of Earth II.
- What is this?</font>

382
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We represent the U.N. from Earth I.</font>

383
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using our Switzerland's hadron collider
and resources from every nation,</font>

384
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:45,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">our people have constructed
a trans-dimensional gateway here.</font>

385
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't do this.</font>

386
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:48,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">The science works out.</font>

387
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:50,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've an offer.</font>

388
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:54,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have achieved world peace,
tying our score with yours.</font>

389
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:58,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're willing to concede
if you agree conceding too,</font>

390
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:02,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">forming one gigantic
united United Nations.</font>

391
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We did it.
- You're a fool.</font>

392
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ultimatum is itself
a technical act of aggression.</font>

393
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we simply refuse
to recognize your authority,</font>

394
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">we still remain ahead and you lose.</font>

395
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you win a simple game.</font>

396
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">The larger symbolic victory
will be ours.</font>

397
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:21,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">We refuse.</font>

398
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take the real victory.</font>

399
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:27,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">A logical, effective,
common sense move, Annie Kim.</font>

400
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">One which flies in the very face
of the U.N. itself,</font>

401
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">a fundamentally symbolic organization</font>

402
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">founded on the principles
of high-minded rhetoric</font>

403
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:37,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and empty gestures.</font>

404
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blue U.N. wins.</font>

405
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing.</font>

406
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:53,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can't do anything to stop me.</font>

407
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:57,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone say "can't do anything"?</font>

408
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you'd come.</font>

409
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so busted.</font>

410
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:05,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you
to stop playing operation on me!</font>

411
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your damn board game!</font>

412
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least,
you didn't get my spare ribs.</font>
