<font color="#FFFFFF">and drag you here in
the middle of the night?</font>

151
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is there an astronaut in
the corner making paninis?</font>

152
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple, we don't want you
to tell anyone about this.</font>

153
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:42,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you do, we don't
want them believing you.</font>

154
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:45,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that right, Black Hitler?</font>

155
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your initiation...</font>

156
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">begins...</font>

157
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">now, gentlemen.</font>

158
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys,
I'm looking for Troy.</font>

159
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:54,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he texted me.
He said he's fine,</font>

160
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he couldn't say where he is.
Oh, no, do you think</font>

161
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:59,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's been kidnapped?
Usually it's one of the parents,</font>

162
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it almost always
ends in murder-suicide.</font>

163
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you smiling?
- I'm smiling?</font>

164
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well if you see him, tell him
Jerry's looking for him.</font>

165
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Jeff, what are you going
to wear to Pierce's gay party?</font>

166
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing.
- Ooh, they'll love that.</font>

167
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha.
I mean I'm not going.</font>

168
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dumb and I can't believe
you guys are supporting it.</font>

169
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, this is my father,</font>

170
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius Hawthorne.</font>

171
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I always assumed
your father was dead.</font>

172
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just mathematically.</font>

173
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, mom liked to pretend
that was the case.</font>

174
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are your friends, Pierce?</font>

175
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

176
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minorities, jewesses,</font>

177
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the unseasonably tan?</font>

178
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is inappropriate!</font>

179
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe you'll give that more
weight since I'm "white".</font>

180
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a wide brow.</font>

181
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, Scandinavian?</font>

182
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Swedish.</font>

183
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swedish dogs.</font>

184
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your blood is tainted
by generations</font>

185
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">of race mixing with laplanders.</font>

186
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're basically Finns!</font>

187
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my goodness, he's like
the Abed of racism.</font>

188
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, since no one's
willing to ask,</font>

189
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's going on with your hair?</font>

190
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ordinary toupee hair
is harvested</font>

191
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the heads of
the godless oriental.</font>

192
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Solid ivory is the only way</font>

193
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be assured of
true follicular purity,</font>

194
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">while still identifying
myself as a man of means.</font>

195
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:04,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can excuse racism, but I
draw the line at animal cruelty.</font>

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can excuse racism?</font>

197
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what brings you here?</font>

198
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assuming it's not
for your son's party.</font>

199
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless "segregationist mummy"
is a gay fetish I'm unaware of.</font>

200
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, uh, after
discussing with my father,</font>

201
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">the party's off,</font>

202
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're canceling
pride wipes.</font>

203
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand up straight, Piercinald,</font>

204
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">when talking
to the lower classes.</font>

205
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:22,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go find</font>

206
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">a half-decent ivory buffer</font>

207
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this two-horse town.</font>

208
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the party's cancelled?</font>

209
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:31,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bought a cone bra.</font>

210
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:33,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piercinald, please tell me
you did not</font>

211
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">cancel your gay party
because of your father.</font>

212
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a business decision, Jeff.</font>

213
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:40,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took a look at the numbers,
had someone explain them to me,</font>

214
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is the way we're going.</font>

215
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said
Pierce's idea was dumb?</font>

216
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well that's before it was
being oppressed by a—</font>

217
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A father?
- A homophobe!</font>

218
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't about fathers.</font>

219
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about
a long-suffering community</font>

220
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a constitutional right</font>

221
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">to wipe whoever
and whatever they want.</font>

222
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you like gay people
so much,</font>

223
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't you marry them?</font>

224
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:58,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so edible.</font>

225
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you are gonna
make a terrible therapist.</font>

226
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you need to talk
to someone about that,</font>

227
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:03,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't recommend you.</font>

228
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, is that how your
dad talked to your mom?</font>

229
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's how
he talked to your mom.</font>

230
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does that make you feel?</font>

231
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

232
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Jeffrey!</font>

233
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I was so sad
when Pierce said</font>

234
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was canceling the party.</font>

235
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was so happy when you
said that it was back on.</font>

236
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's real busy
with his dad,</font>

237
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I knew how much
it meant to him.</font>

238
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I throw a pretty gay party,
huh?</font>

239
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:30,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's great.</font>

240
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if you're
into that kind of thing.</font>

241
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to mingle.</font>

242
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

243
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gay bash,
courtesy of Hawthorne Wipes.</font>

244
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cancelled this!</font>

245
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I uncancelled it.</font>

246
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad's gonna disown me!</font>

247
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:44,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, then you'll be
free of him forever.</font>

248
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never have to cower at
the sound of his voice</font>

249
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">or shudder when
you see an elephant.</font>

250
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome, Pierce.</font>

251
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:53,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just did what you
never had the guts to do.</font>

252
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
Britta was right.</font>

253
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You resent my father because</font>

254
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've got problems
with your own.</font>

255
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">After "Britta was right",
everything you said</font>

256
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">just sounded like a fog horn.</font>

257
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then have your big gay party.</font>

258
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:03,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out of here!</font>

259
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:05,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Pierce,
just have one drink.</font>

260
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna want to
see the guest of honor.</font>

261
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull the cord, fellas.</font>

262
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:15,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, Pierce, Pierce!</font>

263
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe just one drink.</font>

264
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:24,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.</font>

265
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Barnes...</font>

266
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,341

00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Barnes,

269
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the very beginnings
of civilizations.</font>

270
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our predecessors were slaves,</font>

271
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:44,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">fanning the pharaohs
with palm fronds.</font>

272
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over time, we became expert</font>

273
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">at making our
superiors comfortable.</font>

274
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We made it our business.</font>

275
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:54,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">And along the way, we learned
to make ourselves comfortable.</font>

276
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more palm fronds, Troy.</font>

277
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we are the pharaohs.</font>

278

<font color="#FFFFFF">Breath print approved.</font>

279
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel that?</font>

280
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:14,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I don't feel—</font>

281
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely.</font>

282
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you heard the expression
room temperature?</font>

283
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

284
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the room!</font>

285
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:26,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the

286
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I can't tell where the air
ends and my skin begins.</font>

287
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's incredible.
That's what we do, Troy.</font>

288
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Incredible, invisible,
inbelievable things.</font>

297
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in.</font>

298
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,783

unable to share with outsiders.</font>

300
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:12,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be an
air conditioning repairman</font>

301
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nothing else...</font>

302
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the day you die.</font>

303
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't expect you
to make a decision now.</font>

304
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take 24 hours.</font>

305
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

306
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't feel my pants.</font>

307
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go Pierce, go Pierce,
it's your birthday!</font>

308
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, congratulations,
you got Pierce</font>

309
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">to symbolically kill his father
by dancing to club music.</font>

310
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You of all people
should be happy about this.</font>

311
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce is becoming
a more tolerant person,</font>

312
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:48,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it has nothing
to do with his father.</font>

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me now, dad!</font>

314
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, look at me now, dad!</font>

315
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me now, dad!</font>

316
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:56,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me now, dad!</font>

317
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, where you been?
- I'm not allowed to say.</font>

318
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you Superman?
- No.</font>

319
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you tell me if you were?</font>

320
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd tell everyone.</font>

321
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never understood
why he cared who knew.</font>

322
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the hottest
party we've ever had.</font>

323
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, it's pretty dope.</font>

324
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean,
it's dangerously hot.</font>

325
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our air conditioning system</font>

326
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">wasn't built
for this gay a party.</font>

327
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take a look.</font>

328
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,159
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Tron?
- What's tron?</i></font>

329
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

330
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man this party's
a real sausage fest.</font>

331
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it!</font>

332
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:29,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Knew what?
- Don't play dumb with me.</font>

333
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, did they promise you
the life of your dreams?</font>

334
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:32,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can have all that
as a plumber too,</font>

335
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">but without the pretense.</font>

336
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:34,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you hate them so much?</font>

337
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they're elitist.</font>

338
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">They pump themselves up
to make everybody</font>

339
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">think that they're special.</font>

340
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the truth is
they're not!</font>

341
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a gift.</font>

342
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm special.
I'm not a loser like you.</font>

343
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:46,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna eat Spaceman
paninis with Black Hitler,</font>

344
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:48,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's nothing
you can do about it!</font>

345
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you really seem to be
enjoying yourself.</font>

346
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta say, I don't know
why the word gay means dumb.</font>

347
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:58,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys are
all right in my book.</font>

348
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:02,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne,
get your fine gay-lovin' ass</font>

349
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:04,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">up here and say something
to your fans.</font>

350
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

351
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I tell you something, will
you promise to keep it a secret?</font>

352
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:11,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secret handshake.</font>

353
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secret.</font>

354
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I know I said
I can't talk to you</font>

355
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what's going on,
but I can talk to myself.</font>

356
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you pretend to be me?</font>

357
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:20,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like football,
but also I don't—</font>

358
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:21,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.
Okay, I can't choose between</font>

359
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:22,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">air conditioning and plumbing.</font>

360
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, it's so hard, right?</font>

361
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's ask Abed.
- Now you be me.</font>

362
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What should I do, Abed?
- I don't know</font>

363
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Harrison Ford might know.</font>

364
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:30,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get cocky kid—</font>

365
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this isn't working, okay?
Abed tell me what to do.</font>

366
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:33,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really see the dilemma.</font>

367
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plumbing and air conditioning
seem more or less identical.</font>

368
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not—they couldn't
be more or less identical.</font>

369
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:40,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you
feel like doing?</font>

370
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:42,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, I el like
watching TV with you.</font>

371
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:44,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're making me choose,
and if I choose wrong</font>

372
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">it could screw up my whole life.</font>

373
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:47,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really have to make
a decision,</font>

374
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say go with whatever
makes you the happiest.</font>

375
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, again, they're
virtually the same thing.</font>

376
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I know what I need to do.</font>

377
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get cocky, kid.</font>

378
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, bitches!</font>

379
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:01,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to say
this whole thing...</font>

380
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a huge mistake.</font>

381
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Hawthorne Wipes
is officially</font>

382
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">severing its ties
to the gay community.</font>

383
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw!
- What?</font>

384
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Effective immediately,
it will return</font>

385
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:17,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">to being a straights-only
product.</font>

386
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo!</font>

387
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahhhhhh...</font>

388
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:32,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fake heart attack.</font>

389
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I taught him
everything he knows.</font>

390
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:37,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how long you guys
been on the force?</font>

391
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:41,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!</font>

392
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

393
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was—
- That was my boy.</font>

394
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standing up for good old
Hawthorne values.</font>

395
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:49,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">All due respect, sir,
I have zero respect for you.</font>

396
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Typical Welsh nonsense.
- But father, I—</font>

397
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you really wanna
be like this guy?</font>

398
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wearing
elephant bones on his head.</font>

399
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will be what I tell him
to be because I am his father!</font>

400
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up,
colonel crypt-keeper.</font>

401
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could live a million years and
I could spend every minute of it</font>

402
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">doing important things.</font>

403
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at the end of it all,</font>

404
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:08,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have only lived
half a life</font>

405
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:09,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I had not raised a son.</font>

406
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a gift
that was handed to you.</font>

407
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:12,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You squandered it.</font>

408
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the reason you have
so much hatred in your heart</font>

409
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">is because you're
trying to fill a hole</font>

410
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">where your kid
was supposed to go.</font>

411
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now it's too late.</font>

412
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're just stomping around
trying to prove you exist.</font>

413
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, mission accomplished.</font>

414
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here's a question
I'd like to pass on to you</font>

415
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">from every son of every
crap dad that ever lived.</font>

416
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?</font>

417
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done with you.</font>

418
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:38,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's done with you.</font>

419
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is done with you.</font>

420
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:50,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in.
He's a Hawthorne.</font>

421
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:51,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what they do.</font>

422
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's faking.</font>

423
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, listen,
I just want to say—</font>

424
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that the Canadian
Mallard is the only water fowl</font>

425
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:10,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">that bites his father's head off
on the way out of the womb?</font>

426
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That is definitely not true.
- I don't know.</font>

427
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I looked it up on
the "wackapeediah"</font>

428
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:23,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, um, I just want
to say, you know...</font>

429
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry for killing your dad.</font>

430
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't blame yourself.</font>

431
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">He bought a lot of his organs
from questionable sources.</font>

432
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here, he wanted you
to have this.</font>

433
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Pierce, you should take it.</font>

434
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, I'd love it.</font>

435
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the terms of his will
clearly state</font>

436
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">that whoever kills him
gets to keep it.</font>

437
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, I guess I'm up.</font>

438
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Father, I'll never forget
what you said to me</font>

439
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:59,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">"on my first day of school.</font>

440
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Comb your hair, you idiot.</font>

441
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:03,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look Greek.'</font>

442
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'll never know
if that was true,</font>

443
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">"but I do know that I was too
scared to stand up for myself.</font>

444
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Well, I'm not scared of you
anymore because you're dead,</font>

445
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:14,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and I'm not.</font>

446
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:17,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I win."</font>

447
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can suck it.</font>

448
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude just told
his dead dad to suck it.</font>

449
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">So edible.</font>

450
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst.</font>

451
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your 24 hours has expired.</font>

452
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need an answer, Troy.</font>

453
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready to join
the elite brotherhood</font>

454
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">of guys who
fix air conditioners?</font>

455
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:53,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Vice Dean Laybourne,</font>

456
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:56,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, I realize no one's
better than anyone else.</font>

457
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:58,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, some people
are better at sports and...</font>

458
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there are magicians, but...</font>

459
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:03,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was put on this earth
to do something else.</font>

460
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:05,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're going to be what?</font>

461
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">A plumber?</font>

462
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:10,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not gonna be
a plumber either.</font>

463
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they have
to deal with poop.</font>

464
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">My decision for now
is to watch TV with my friend.</font>

465
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making
a huge mistake, son.</font>

466
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may be, sir.
But at least it's my mistake.</font>

467
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't change
the fact that it's a mistake.</font>

468
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't it?</font>

469
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it doesn't.</font>

470
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, looks like there
was a malfunction</font>

471
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the cafeteria last night.</font>

472
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:41,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Amana 5000 had
a compound coil fracture.</font>

473
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it was fixed.</font>

474
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very funny.</font>

475
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:50,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even I can fix a compound
coil fracture overnight.</font>

476
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he can.</font>

477
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constable Reggie.</font>

478
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector Spacetime.</font>

479
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:59,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't over, Troy Barnes.</font>

480
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only just begun.</font>

481
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, I was wrong.</font>

482
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you'll make
a very good therapist.</font>

483
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:06,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why is that?</font>

484
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you really nailed Pierce
in that whole oedipal thing.</font>

485
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy's got some
serious father issues.</font>

486
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think you may have
had some oedipal issues as well?</font>

487
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:15,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really seeing
the connection.</font>

488
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You literally killed a father.</font>

489
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, not mine, dummy.</font>

490
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

491
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Winger.
You going home alone?</font>

492
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:30,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay.</font>

493
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was close,
Constable Reggie.</font>

494
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought those blorgons
had us dead to rights.</font>

495
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">What on bitter earth do they
want from us, inspector?</font>

496
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:42,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question's not what they
want from us, constable.</font>

497
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:43,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when!</font>

498
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector, look out, blorgons!</font>

499
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:48,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eradicate!
Eradicate!</font>

500
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:50,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eradicate... Eradicate...</font>

501
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that, blorgon scum.</font>

502
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:55,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old are you guys?</font>

503
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question isn't
how old we are...</font>

504
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when old we are!</font>

505
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your face, blorgonian!</font>

506
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:08,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pew, pew, pew, pew!</font>
