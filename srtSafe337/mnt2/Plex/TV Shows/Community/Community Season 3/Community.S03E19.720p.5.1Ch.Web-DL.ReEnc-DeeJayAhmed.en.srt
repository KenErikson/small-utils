after being kicked out</font>

2
00:00:07,197 --> 00:00:09,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">of you know where.</font>

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:10,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, good thing I came up</font>

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">with this idea
for potluck dinners.</font>

5
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, all you said was,
"I'm hungry."</font>

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Henry Ford said was,
"I need a ride."</font>

7
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:18,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, is that a casserole?</font>

8
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bagel bites</font>

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a deconstructed
hot pocket reduction</font>

10
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a doritos glaze.</font>

11
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just really want
to make my food, you know.</font>

12
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did anybody bring anything
that isn't poison?</font>

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to eat
natural, organic foods,</font>

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'm never gonna get rid
of this hangover.</font>

15
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:33,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, what'd you bring?</font>

16
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pack of lifesavers.</font>

17
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
Dead battery.</font>

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Abed?</font>

19
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen Abed?</font>

20
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's probably out getting
something really cool</font>

21
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the dinner.</font>

22
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:51,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? Cool.
Abed brought delicious police.</font>

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what happened?</font>

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found your friend going
through the dumpster</font>

25
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:56,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside the administration
building in Greendale again.</font>

26
00:00:56,779 --> 00:01:01,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cadet could use a lesson
in intergalactic protocol.</font>

27
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:02,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, officer.</font>

28
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just playing a character
from TV.</font>

29
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, I'm very familiar
with Inspector Spacetime.</font>

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think a guy becomes a cop</font>

31
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">because his prom night
was a dream?</font>

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this were comic-con,
I'd take a bullet for that kid.</font>

33
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, here in the real world,
trespassing is a crime.</font>

34
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:16,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry, officer.</font>

35
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our friend has been having
a hard time</font>

36
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:22,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">adjusting to being expelled
from Greendale.</font>

37
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It won't happen again.
- That's for sure.</font>

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to your former Dean.
I recommended he press charges.</font>

39
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he'd hold off</font>

40
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the condition that you set
an appointment with this guy.</font>

41
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's offering to foot</font>

42
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:33,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bill for the consultation
himself.</font>

43
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the number
for a psychiatrist.</font>

44
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.
Abed's not crazy.</font>

45
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where does the Dean get off?
He's not the real Dean.</font>

46
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been replaced
by an identical life-form</font>

47
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:42,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">for some nefarious purpose.</font>

48
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reggie, to the time booth.</font>

49
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't much...
space.</font>

50
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:49,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right there, Inspector.</font>

51
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, before I go, you really
shouldn't be using this</font>

52
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">to prop open
your building's door.</font>

53
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:55,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an antique fire brick.</font>

54
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say pre-civil war.</font>

55
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:01,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Note the uneven orange hue
and the embossment on the back.</font>

56
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:03,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a nifty little piece
of americana.</font>

57
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:07,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could get 50, 60 bucks
for it from the right collector.</font>

58
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I watch a lot

00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,122

Rich people, Troy's joining you.</font>

64
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:25,967

a little chat tonight,</font>

00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and I.
How does that sound?</font>

76
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:06,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need therapy.</font>

77
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's
a perfectly normal response.</font>

anything yet.</font>

Got your back, brah.</font>

81
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:19,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to say, I didn't expect
to see so many of you.</font>

82
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed won't go to any kind
of doctor on his own.</font>

83
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:23,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">We caught him last year</font>

00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to remove
his own tonsils.</font>

85
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't you let me
take it from here?</font>

86
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to understand
about Abed.</font>

87
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's usually,
you know, adorable weird,</font>

88
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">like mork from ork,
but, since we got expelled,</font>

89
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:36,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's been creepy weird,
like present-day Robin Williams.</font>

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not crazy.
- Well, Abed,</font>

91
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't deal in crazy.</font>

92
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I deal in health.
- Hmm.</font>

93
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how long has Abed needed
a crazy amount of help?</font>

94
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:54,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of this behavior
started after you were expelled?</font>

95
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">There may have been
a ramp-up.</font>

96
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, buddy.</font>

97
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,264

we're good until spring, okay?</font>

98
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't make any sense.</font>

99
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of it this way.</font>

100
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get the hour back
later in the year.</font>

101
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,407

104

the hilarious Thrill Ride.</font>

105

106
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
A master at storytelling.</font>

107
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a master
at making movies in general.</font>

108
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna say it.
He's the new Spielberg.</font>

109
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

110
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go.
Excuse me.</font>

111
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

112
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:40,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a bad person.
You're a bad person.</font>

113
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time enough at last
to eat a sandwich.</font>

114
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though even he knew
that this sandwich</font>

115
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">was nearer his last sandwich
than his first.</font>

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I'm trying to eat.</font>

117
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, oldly,</font>

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">his brittle bones straining
to support the weight</font>

119
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">of his wrinkly skin.</font>

120
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop narrating me.</font>

121
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shouted to no one,</font>

122
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:59,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">just a man alone in time
with nothing</font>

123
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the cold squishiness
of tuna salad to comfort him.</font>

124
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it back.</font>

125
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want
to be in your novel.</font>

126
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne had nearly
lost his grip on reality.</font>

127
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lately, he'd begun to think
he was in a novel.</font>

128
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:12,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">And action.</font>

129
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what the hell
are you doing?</font>

130
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut. We got it.
One more for safety.</font>

131
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, it's 4:30
in the morning,</font>

132
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're in my bedroom.</font>

133
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use that.
Okay.</font>

134
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">And action.</font>

135
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's almost completely
nearly all of it.</font>

136
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Abed is as sick
as you all say,</font>

137
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I have no...
Wait a minute.</font>

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody in this room
gets to define sick.</font>

139
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

140
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:32,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a psychiatrist.</font>

141
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any kind of doctor can really.</font>

142
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

143
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if Abed's sick,</font>

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we're all sick.
Yeah.</font>

145
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't determine
a person's sanity</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">from a few amusing stories.</font>

147
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Exactly.
- That's right.</font>

148
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if anything,
Abed's more sane than any of us.</font>

149
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Well.</font>

150
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he's certainly
the craziest one of us,</font>

151
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, you know, we're all
kind of crazy-town banana pants.</font>

152
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to me
about crazy-town banana pants.</font>

153
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're just saying
it's been a crazy year</font>

154
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">for everybody.</font>

155
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who among us hasn't had
the odd banana</font>

156
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">in his or her pants, right?</font>

157
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have.</font>

158
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:17,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does peyote last?
Just asking for a friend.</font>

159
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed and Annie
in the morning ♪</font>

160
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:22,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

161
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

162
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing my ass.</font>

163
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are all these cameras
doing here?</font>

164
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:34,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, take my coat.</font>

165
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

166
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

167
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so sweet.</font>

168
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't eat anything
or drink anything,</font>

169
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no sweating
or bending at the elbows,</font>

170
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no chairs with backrests,
and if you take it off,</font>

171
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:51,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">wooden hangers only.</font>

172
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're probably
warm now, right?</font>

173
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news, guys.</font>

174
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent all my money.</font>

175
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, you can't bring that
in here.</font>

176
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I can.
It's all-terrain, dummy.</font>

177
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:05,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a plate of cookies
for the study group,</font>

178
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my boys ate them,</font>

179
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">so since they took something
of yours,</font>

180
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">you all get something
of theirs.</font>

181
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elijah loves this, Britta.</font>

182
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, Jeff.
There you go, Troy.</font>

183
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, Pierce.</font>

184
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karate championship,
second place!</font>

185
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'll be unstoppable.</font>

186
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oyay!</font>

187
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you see
what you call insanity</font>

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">we call solidarity.</font>

189
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:27,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just finished telling him
about it,</font>

191
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you grab it and squeeze it?</font>

192
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I said I was sorry.
- Uh-huh.</font>

193
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so as a group,
do you always indulge Abed</font>

194
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">in these little misadventures?</font>

195
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that back.</font>

196
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:44,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our adventures are very manly.</font>

197
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to say
there's more important</font>

198
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">to mental health
than a support system.</font>

199
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">And assuming
that this group is,</font>

200
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:52,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Abed, said support system,</font>

201
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've heard everything
I need to hear</font>

202
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to make a decision.</font>

203
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
that Abed should be committed.</font>

204
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean committed
to his character work, right?</font>

205
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he already is.
Abed, show him your Don Draper.</font>

206
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cigarettes.</font>

207
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean an institution.</font>

208
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean like marriage?</font>

209
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean a mental institution.</font>

210
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. So do I.</font>

211
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will someone please help me
lighten the mood?</font>

212
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:24,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please,
Mr. Dr. Psychiatrist, sir,</font>

213
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">please don't send my best friend
to crazy people jail.</font>

214
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.
He doesn't have the right.</font>

215
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's not dangerous.</font>

216
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's just unique,
like a snowflake</font>

217
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">who gets bent out of shape</font>

218
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>when you mix up Star Wars
and space treks.</i></font>

219
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:38,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a serial killer's signature.</font>

220
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a psych major.</font>

221
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">His continued obsession
with Greendale Community College</font>

222
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">suggests the potential
for escalation.</font>

223
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, frankly, these stories
you've been telling me</font>

224
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">are very troubling.</font>

225
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're troubled?</font>

226
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember
any of those things happening.</font>

227
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when do these three
live together?</font>

228
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Abed's obsession
with Greendale</font>

229
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't make him crazy.</font>

230
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had gone
to school there,</font>

231
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd be obsessed with it too.</font>

232
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a messed-up place.</font>

233
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We had lockers.
- Yeah.</font>

234
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're survivors.</font>

235
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.</font>

236
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's weady to wearn?</font>

237
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:13,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, this is not the way
to agree on parking</font>

238
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the job fair!
It's inhumane.</font>

239
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a better idea, Britta?</font>

240
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Thousands of them.</font>

241
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki to Queen 3.</font>

242
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:24,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neigh.</font>

243
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all for today.
Read chapter four.</font>

244
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're
just gonna ignore that.</font>

245
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bananas?
- Yes.</font>

246
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Toast?
- Yes.</font>

247
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bubble gum?
- Yes.</font>

248
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pancakes?
- Yes.</font>

249
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fries?
- Get out.</font>

250
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:01,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

251
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:05,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one every year.
I will not tolerate clowning.</font>

252
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:06,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Car keys?
- Yes.</font>

253
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, last bathroom break.
We've got to cram for...</font>

254
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, sir,
can we get to our...</font>

255
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slow your bones, Rufus.</font>

256
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a long road tomorrow.</font>

257
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:25,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome...</font>

258
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">to ladders.</font>

259
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting.</font>

260
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh.</font>

261
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wanted to see
if we got the same thing.</font>

262
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds as though this
Greendale had quite an effect</font>

263
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:42,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">on all of you.</font>

264
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should all definitely
stop dwelling on it</font>

265
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you want to be healthy.</font>

266
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:48,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, come on,
it wasn't all bad.</font>

267
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was there longer than anybody,
and I'm fine.</font>

268
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

269
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you ask?
3:30.</font>

270
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

271
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:56,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Pierce was saying</font>

272
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he started sundowning
is true.</font>

273
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just pass
the crazy buck to Greendale.</font>

274
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be a good place too.</font>

275
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">That really doesn't matter.</font>

276
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we have a lot of memories</font>

277
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Greendale
being in our corner.</font>

278
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:07,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean-a-ling.</font>

279
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to drop by</font>

280
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell you we ought
to be hot-stepping it out</font>

281
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the parking lot
in a brisk, but orderly fashion.</font>

282
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a fire drill?</font>

283
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir,
there's an actual fire.</font>

284
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted you guys
to be the first to know</font>

285
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I tell everyone else.</font>

286
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. It's not right
to play favorites,</font>

287
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it is no more right
to sit on your feelings,</font>

288
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't know
what I'd do without you guys.</font>

289
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:25,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

290
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fire, fire!
There's a fire!</font>

291
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darcy, you've got a cold.</font>

292
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel fine.
- You're sick. Go home!</font>

293
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.
Get out of here.</font>

294
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.
Get out of here!</font>

295
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe we got here
too late for pizza.</font>

296
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worst pizza day ever.</font>

297
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, darn it.</font>

298
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:54,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I gonna do
with all this garbage?</font>

332
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was barely in them?</font>

333
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were all
about Dean Pelton.</font>

334
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I've been trying
to make</font>

335
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:30,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">you guys understand
for the last two months.</font>

336
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep telling you,</font>

337
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">we weren't expelled
by the real Dean.</font>

338
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It couldn't have been him.
He loved us.</font>

339
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:38,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we've been so concerned
with moving past Greendale,</font>

340
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've been living in denial.</font>

341
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true.
I mean, let's face it.</font>

342
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't driven crazy
by Greendale.</font>

343
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Abed's not the crazy one
for obsessing about it.</font>

344
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we're sorry.
We haven't been supporting you,</font>

345
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we haven't been honest
with ourselves.</font>

346
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Heidi, something weird
is going on with that school.</font>

347
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:59,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed doesn't need to be here.
We need to be there.</font>

348
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is no there.</font>

349
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:04,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the problem.
That's why we have to go back.</font>

350
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't go back
to Greendale.</font>

351
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
Because it isn't healthy?</font>

352
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:11,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause it doesn't exist.</font>

353
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I parked by a meter.</font>

354
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of y'all park by a meter?</font>

355
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

356
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:26,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you mean,
Greendale doesn't exist?</font>

357
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there is a place
called Greendale,</font>

358
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you all spent
three years there,</font>

359
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was
not a community college.</font>

360
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">These memories that you people
have been sharing</font>

361
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">are a shared psychosis.</font>

362
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were patients there
together,</font>

363
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were released together,
and I am alarmed to see</font>

364
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:51,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you are now relapsing
together.</font>

365
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

366
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not real.
You're lying.</font>

367
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:59,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Search your mind
for the real memories.</font>

368
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to look past the trauma
you've been blocking out.</font>

369
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What trauma?
- You all came</font>

370
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">to this community college</font>

371
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">after your lives had fractured.</font>

372
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pill addiction,
failed legal career,</font>

373
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">broken marriage,
lost scholarship,</font>

374
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- old.
- Enough!</font>

375
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear mine.</font>

376
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, if we were going
to fabricate a delusion,</font>

377
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:22,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">why would we fabricate
a community college?</font>

378
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, this fantastical
community college</font>

379
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:29,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">where everything that happens
is unbelievably ridiculous</font>

380
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:32,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it all revolves
around you as a group.</font>

381

into psychosis, miss Perry.</font>

alternative</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">to your grim reality.</font>

384
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe the secret
trampoline we found?</font>

385
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
It's so great.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I knew it.</font>

449
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:25,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop letting him
make you realize stuff.</font>

450
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">These aren't even good lies.</font>

451
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, fine,
I had to come up with something.</font>

452
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were getting too close.
- Close to what?</font>

453
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:31,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the truth.</font>

454
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:32,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Indian kid was right.</font>

455
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's Arabic.
- Also Polish.</font>

456
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:35,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.
I'm a fake psychiatrist,</font>

457
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">not a fake ethnologist.</font>

458
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point
is your Dean was kidnapped</font>

459
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">by Ben Chang and replaced</font>

460
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a double.</font>

461
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hired
to keep you off the scent.</font>

462
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang kidnapped the Dean?</font>

463
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even for him, that's insane.</font>

464
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:47,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?
Think about it.</font>

465
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!
I said hot damn!</font>

466
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang...</font>

467
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

468
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm predicting future crimes.</font>

469
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm sick.</font>

470
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, you said
that would happen.</font>

471
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a pre-cog!</font>

472
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again.</font>

473
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're weak.</font>

474
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, guys,</font>

475
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">while we were remembering
Chang is crazy,</font>

476
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fake doctor sneaked away.</font>

477
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, crap!
- What?</font>

478
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">There goes our only chance
of clearing our names.</font>

479
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, forget about us.
The Dean has been kidnapped.</font>

480
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out there somewhere,
alone and cold</font>

481
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">and most likely
trying to cobble together</font>

482
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:45,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">a sexy Patty Hearst costume.</font>

483
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:47,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's right.
Wait, what?</font>

484
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:48,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to rescue the Dean.</font>

485
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get back
to that school.</font>

486
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we definitely never need
to do another paintball.</font>

487
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- See, therapy does work.</font>

488
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're cured.
- Aw. Aw.</font>

489
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like the study group
has gotten wise</font>

490
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Operation Doppel-Deaner.</font>

491
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for phase two.
What's phase two?</font>

492
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm making up
the same plan you are.</font>

493
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:10,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pitches, pitches, pitches.</font>

494
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:12,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, thank you, Megan.</font>

495
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed

496
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:18,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nights.</font>

497
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome back,
all you night owls.</font>

498
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, why don't we open up
the phone lines?</font>

499
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:24,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to us, lonely hearts.
We got Jeff W. calling.</font>

00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:27,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff,
what's your question?</font>

502
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is this?
- Great question.</font>

503
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:30,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're us.

and go to sleep.</font>

514
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Jacks and Jills,
