152
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're actually
a lot taller than Seacrest.</font>

153
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:41,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've actually got
a sharper jaw too.</font>

154
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're actually more handsome
than the guy</font>

155
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:43,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's famous
for being handsome.</font>

156
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff?</font>

157
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:54,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be okay.
Just stay humble.</font>

158
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, maybe
there's another option for you.</font>

159
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a big event saturday.</font>

160
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Needs a lot of bodies, huh?</font>

161
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I see some
high-value faces here.</font>

162
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got an Oprah.</font>

163
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- And sitting next to her</font>

164
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a Judy Garland
or an Anne Hathaway.</font>

165
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add a few extra teeth.</font>

166
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, this is rare.</font>

167
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:14,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both versions
of Michael Jackson.</font>

168
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you...</font>

169
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:16,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.</font>

170
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What?</font>

171
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:18,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.</font>

172
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:19,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whatever.
- Whatever.</font>

173
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:21,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you guys work
this gig for me</font>

174
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">for six hours,
we'll call it even.</font>

175
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds fun.</font>

176
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, Vinnie, can we have
a minute to talk about this?</font>

177
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. Come on, Vinnie. The guy
who makes the fish sticks</font>

178
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">looks just like Quincy Jones.</font>

179
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:31,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get out.
- Seriously.</font>

180
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I'm sorry,</font>

181
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is where
we have to put our foot down.</font>

182
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she has a point.</font>

183
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time it'll be $10,000,
and then $20,000,</font>

184
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then he'll hit rock bottom</font>

185
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">and have no one to turn to
but Jesus.</font>

186
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:41,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we let this play out.</font>

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to help,</font>

188
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:45,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">but playing Ryan Seacrest
at a big party</font>

189
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">may not be a safe
situation for me.</font>

190
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:49,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could actually hurt Abed</font>

191
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">if every time he faces reality,</font>

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">we dress up and play
make-believe to bail him out.</font>

193
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame on you people.</font>

194
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not our job
to help Abed grow up.</font>

195
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed doesn't need reality.</font>

196
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed is a magical,
elf-like man</font>

197
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">who makes us all more magical</font>

198
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">by being near us.</font>

199
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, who came over
in the middle of the night</font>

200
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">that time you forgot how to
fart?</font>

201
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- Shirley...</font>

202
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who got you a DVD of Precious,</font>

203
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:12,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">based on the novel Push,
by Sapphire,</font>

204
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a copy of the novel Push
autographed by Sapphire?</font>

205
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

206
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we had was dumb reality
before we met that man.</font>

207
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's made all of our lives
better than reality.</font>

208
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it becomes
a little inconvenient,</font>

209
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's time to get real?</font>

210
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">For shame!</font>

211
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.
Sorry, Troy.</font>

212
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:30,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

213
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we would be happy
to help you out.</font>

214
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a good time.</font>

215
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
- Cool.</font>

216
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oprah.
- Oh, thank you.</font>

217
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:39,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See ya, Vin.
- Fat Brando.</font>

218
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:43,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Burt Reynolds.
- Yeah.</font>

219
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for being flexible.
This'll be fun.</font>

220
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fun. Yeah, sure.
But here's the deal.</font>

221
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, if you guys mess this up,</font>

222
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">then his debt is overdue.</font>

223
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't send another bill.</font>

224
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I send two guys
that look a lot</font>

225
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:58,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">like Ving Rhames
and Michael Chiklis.</font>

226
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they do
a very convincing impression</font>

227
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:03,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">of breaking your friend's legs.</font>

228
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their secret is...
They actually break them.</font>

229
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, impersonators,</font>

230
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:19,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">our guest of honor
is one Howie Schwartz,</font>

231
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">who, according to the Talmud,</font>

232
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:22,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">just became a man.
But I have to say,</font>

233
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't want him
next to me in a foxhole.</font>

234
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ha!
- Ground rules...</font>

235
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,947

assigned quadrants</font>

236

<font color="#FFFFFF">that your impersonatee was in.</font>

238
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,370

hiccup, or cuss.</font>

being James,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">our resident Walter Matthau.</font>

242
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:42,245

243
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, you give 'em hell.
All right, let's go.</font>

244
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:48,616

- Ready to tangle.</font>

I need you in this tux.</font>

246

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, do not wear that.</font>

247
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, zip it, white Jacko.</font>

248
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:57,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, that thing
in the cafeteria freaked me out,</font>

249
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I talked to my shrink,
and she doubled my dosage.</font>

250
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Jeff, that's insane!</font>

251
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought so too, but after
I took that extra pill,</font>

252
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">it seemed like a great idea.</font>

253

- No, Jeff!</font>

to say,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Annie.
Just one of the perks</font>

brought a scalpel to a bris?</font>

289
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now smile.</font>

290
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,947

embarrassed for you</font>

296

<font color="#FFFFFF">because you've never seen
Lorenzo's Oil.</font>

00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that person that you
study for your psych class?</font>

451
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that should be me.</font>

452
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-uh. No way.</font>

453
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are way out of my league,
diagnostically speaking.</font>

454
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go with someone
a little less complicated.</font>

455
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Abed.</font>

456
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Abed.</font>

457
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Where's Troy?</font>

458
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the other room.</font>

459
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay.
There are many advantages</font>

460
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">of traveling by yourself.</font>

461
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:22,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can drive faster,
change direction.</font>

462
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only pee breaks
are yours.</font>

463
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you real?
- Are you?</font>

464
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really crazy.</font>

465
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">And inaccessible,
and maybe too dark.</font>

466
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe to them, but not to us.</font>

467
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.</font>

468
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot.
Hot, hot, hot.</font>

469
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:03,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen...</font>

470
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's ready to chang the world?</font>

471
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:11,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang! Chang! Chang!</font>

472
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang! Chang! Chang!
Chang! Chang!</font>

473
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">All hail Chang!</font>
