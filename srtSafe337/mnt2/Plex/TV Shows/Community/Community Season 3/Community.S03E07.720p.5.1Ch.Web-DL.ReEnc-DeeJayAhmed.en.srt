a honeymoon phase,</font>

You're 20.</font>

15

It's natural.</font>

it was a handicap space?</font>

33
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,652

the wheelchair was yelling it.</font>

41
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:38,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what they tell me.</font>

42
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Britta,
you got me all figured out.</font>

43
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I can tell
you're not in bed.</font>

44
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Britta.</font>

45
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretending
to be violently ill</font>

46

47
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm 13.</font>

48
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,134

physician, Mr. Winger?</font>

49
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Dr. Schroeder.
S-c-h.</font>

50
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, do you want to see
my insurance card?</font>

51
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

52
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, are you at a hospital?</font>

53
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm at The Gap.</font>

54
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that?</font>

55
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a heart monitor.</font>

56
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a machine telling me
I'm low on khakis.</font>

00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap, I- I'm sorry.
I just assumed—</font>

59
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.
I don't blame you.</font>

60
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lied before.</font>

61
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably karma
that I'm sick.</font>

62
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">But believe me,
if you had what I have,</font>

63
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd rather be moving boxes.</font>

64
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, feel better.</font>

65
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

66
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll see
you guys on Monday.</font>

67
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,789

<font color="#FFFFFF">So are you.</font>

69
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing after this?</font>

70
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably trying
a couple of boot-cuts.</font>

71
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after that...</font>

72
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:43,835

00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:41,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if this is a forecast
of the conversation,</font>

152
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will ride with somebody else.</font>

153
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, Shirley.</font>

154
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep me company while I fix this</font>

155
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll give you
a ride over there.</font>

156
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:52,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta!</font>

157
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hey there, stranger!</font>

158
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a coincidence, huh?</font>

159
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:59,564
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is just like that, uh,
Lake House movie.</i></font>

160
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only assume.
Even I have limits.</font>

161
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Pelton.</font>

162
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, it's Saturday.
Call me Craig.</font>

163
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:09,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off campus,
I'm just a craigular Joe.</font>

164
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, what'd you get?</font>

165
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, now I feel like I have to
head back out there.</font>

166
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:15,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean—uh, Craig,</font>

167
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's nice to see you
but I actually have to run.</font>

168
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, you're probably
heading to help Annie move.</font>

169
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

170
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:24,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I follow Troy
and Abed on Twitter.</font>

171
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Annie's moving
and you're...</font>

172
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sick at the hospital?</font>

173
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curious.</font>

174
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might head there myself.</font>

175
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could tell them you said hi.</font>

176
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather you didn't.</font>

177
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe I won't have time.</font>

178
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially if we're doing...</font>

179
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lunch?</font>

180
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:51,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but your religion
isn't the same as morality.</font>

181
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">And calling me amoral
because I'm atheistic</font>

182
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">is religious persecution.</font>

183
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I religiously
persecute you?</font>

184
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a religion.</font>

185
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look!
A hitchhiker.</font>

186
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">A person in need.</font>

187
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
What am I doing?</font>

188
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pulling over
to help him out.</font>

189
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:06,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not help him out.</font>

190
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, because it
proves the existence</font>

191
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">of secular morality?</font>

192
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because he looks stinky.</font>

193
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judge not, Shirley.
Judge not.</font>

194
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really appreciate it,
thank you.</font>

195
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you headed,
fellow human?</font>

196
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riverside Falls?</font>

197
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 40 minutes away.</font>

198
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I guess I'm just
a really good person.</font>

199
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you were.</font>

200
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could see the kindness
in your faces.</font>

201
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume you've both
accepted Jesus Christ</font>

202
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">as your lord and savior?</font>

203
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.</font>

204
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

205
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Needed a coat of paint anyway.</font>

206
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, Annie,
to your new home.</font>

207
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay... To reacquaint you,
there's the bathroom,</font>

208
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">kitchen,
and, of course, our bedroom.</font>

209
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the room's a rockin'
please come a knockin'</font>

210
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:02,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">because there's something
probably terribly wrong.</font>

211
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're pretty chill
in there.</font>

212
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm, now let's go
see your room.</font>

213
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

214
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is your room.</font>

215
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said this was
a two bedroom.</font>

216
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is, one, two.</font>

217
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours is a blanket fort.</font>

218
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">An awesome blanket fort.</font>

219
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">But still highly flammable
so no candles.</font>

220
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

221
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tweet it?
- Tweeting it!</font>

222
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not surprised
you're so taken aback.</font>

223
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">This apartment
is where dreams come true.</font>

224
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">We spent our whole lives
being told that blanket forts</font>

225
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">are only for special occasions,</font>

226
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">like sleepovers
or when uncles die.</font>

227
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's a lie, Annie.</font>

228
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can live
in a fort of blankets</font>

229
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">all day, every night.</font>

230
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so awesome.</font>

231
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised you guys haven't
chosen to live in one.</font>

232
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:52,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll be spending
enough time in yours.</font>

233
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's where
we're gonna watch tv.</font>

234
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

235
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what's that door
over there?</font>

236
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:03,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a bedroom?</font>

237
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.</font>

238
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a linen closet?</font>

239
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something like that.</font>

240
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a linen closet?</font>

241
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">A siesta salad and an iced tea.</font>

242
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:16,066
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Excelente.
And for you?</i></font>

243
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

244
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The gentleman...
- Oh...</font>

245
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">will have
a top notch-os</font>

246
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a watermelon Margarita.</font>

247
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jeffrey.</font>

248
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, any brothers or sisters?</font>

249
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll take the check too.</font>

250
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:35,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
What's the rush?</font>

251
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're eating lunch,
and then I'm leaving.</font>

252
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
I just hope that I don't</font>

253
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">bump into
your study group on Monday.</font>

254
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I pray they don't ask me</font>

255
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">who I saw at the mall
on Saturday.</font>

256
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because,
unlike a certain someone,</font>

257
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't think I could lie
to those sweet people.</font>

258
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, this is blackmail.</font>

259
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Call me Craig.</font>

260
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:56,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">And call blackmail
"a day at the mall with Craig."</font>

261
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's all
I require, Jeffrey.</font>

262
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are going
to have some fun.</font>

263
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">And create a few memories.</font>

264
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I suggest you get into it.</font>

265
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:08,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that counts.</font>

266
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:11,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">A song for the señor, señor?</font>

267
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Adiós amores.</i></font>

268
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:19,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what a surprise.</font>

269
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm!</font>

270
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez.</font>

271
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is actually
quite calming for some reason.</font>

272
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:00,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's when I realized
I had to forgive them.</font>

273
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a beautiful story.</font>

274
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">So inspiring how he came
to find the lord.</font>

275
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Isn't it, Britta?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

276
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I didn't exactly have
to find the lord.</font>

277
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was inside me.</font>

278
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen!
What's your name, friend?</font>

279
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus.
- Oh.</font>

280
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Latino?</font>

281
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:16,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my child.
I am him.</font>

282
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're what now?</font>

283
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:18,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the one true son of God.</font>

284
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sent here
to save humanity.</font>

285
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

286
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it is a pleasure
to have you in my car, Jesus.</font>

287
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, stop.
It's not funny now.</font>

288
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Jesus, just curious, what's
your position on marijuana?</font>

289
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was given to us by God.</font>

290
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:31,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be legal.</font>

291
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:35,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice.</font>

292
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear me, hear me!</font>

293
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Presenting
the real-life fairy tale</font>

294
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:55,625

00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">from bad neighborhood forest</font>

00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, once upon a time</font>

303
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a beautiful
princess named Annie.</font>

304
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was harassed every day
by Count Spaghetti.</font>

306
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">The evil cracksmith who lived
outside of her building.</font>

307
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

308
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just stand here?</font>

309
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Jeffrey.</font>

310
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in here!</font>

311
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be fun!</font>

312
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or else.</font>

313
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:35,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we just punch in
the numbers?</font>

314
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:36,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

315
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you know this one, Jeff.</font>

316
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've sang it a thousand times
together in my mind.</font>

317
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, huh?
Oh come on, Jeffrey.</font>

318
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make or break time.</font>

319
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you want to be
back here next Saturday.</font>

a little fun.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, see?</font>

340
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you emailed your therapist</font>

341
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you wanted to be
alone this weekend.</font>

342
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

343
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

344
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:36,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Thank you very much.</font>

345
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, with your permission,</font>

346
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to sing a little song
about race-mixing.</font>

348
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:46,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!</font>

349
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, good evening, senator.</font>

350
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any requests?</font>

351
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want to do next?
I paid for a full hour, so—</font>

352
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:08,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I email my therapist
from my Greendale account.</font>

353
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same account
where I received an email</font>

354
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:13,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">from physique25 telling me
about today's sale.</font>

355
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you're at the mall?</font>

356
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">You read student emails?</font>

357
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, now the patriot act</font>

358
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:20,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">says I can do it, Jeffrey...
Technically.</font>

359
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need I remind you
the nation is at war— Ow!</font>

360
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll kill you.
- No, Jeffrey, no!</font>

361
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, Jeffrey come on!</font>

362
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just remember,
we were making memories!</font>

363
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:30,306
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, Jeffrey, no!</i></font>

364
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:31,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

365
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Jeffrey!
No, no, it's too violent!</font>

366
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're scaring me!
Don't let the terrorists win!</font>

367
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:43,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then the three of them lived
happily ever after!</font>

368
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Bebad became
the little dipper.</font>

369
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">The end.</font>

370
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:53,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kiss me, woodsman Troy!
- Mwah!</font>

371
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys!</font>

372
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Living here is gonna be
fun all the time.</font>

373
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make
the entire apartment a fort.</font>

374
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get more blankets.</font>

375
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a space we reserved
for virtual adventures.</font>

376
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a playroom but
only works in our minds.</font>

377
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call it the dreamatorium.</font>

378
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... it's a bedroom.</font>

379
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.
There's only two bedrooms,</font>

380
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">including the blanket fort.</font>

381
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the...</font>

382
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dreamatorium.</font>

383
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">All day, I've been</font>

384
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">jumping through hoops
to fit in.</font>

385
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Including the literal hoops</font>

386
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">you put in front of the toilet.</font>

387
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- And you guys are hoarding</font>

388
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">this second bedroom
as some kind of playroom?</font>

389
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">And making me sleep
on a pile of laundry?</font>

390
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we worked hard on that.
And it's a blanket fort.</font>

391
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an asylum
for half-witted children!</font>

392
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the only adult
in this apartment,</font>

393
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am making an ultimatum.</font>

394
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me or this...
Stupid dreamatorium.</font>

395
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dreamatorium is non-negotiable.
Read the lease.</font>

396
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially the part
we added in crayon.</font>

397
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't wanna
take this to court.</font>

398
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust us, this place
can be a courtroom</font>

399
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the blink of an eye.</font>

400
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't work for me.</font>

401
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the minute
I joined the study group</font>

402
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been worried
about how uptight I am</font>

403
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how I'm no fun.</font>

404
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I was worried
that I wouldn't fit in here</font>

405
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">or be able to hang
with you guys.</font>

406
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what?</font>

407
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you ever ask
yourselves whether</font>

408
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can hang with me?</font>

409
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I always the one
that has to adapt?</font>

410
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of this crap!</font>

411
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your stupid dreamatorium.</font>

412
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will!</font>

413
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because this is
our apartment too!</font>

414
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just because we're awesome</font>

415
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't mean we're not adults!</font>

416
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Candy cigarette?</font>

417
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want a candy cigarette.</font>

418
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want our Annie.
- Yeah, we blew it.</font>

419
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:48,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I picked the wrong week
to quit.</font>

420
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

421
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">In security deposit terms,
it's a gold mine.</font>

422
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're lucky it's only
gonna cost you money.</font>

423
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend nearly
killed himself.</font>

424
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's me.</font>

425
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky Annie.</font>

426
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really sorry, Annie.</font>

427
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had some island girls over</font>

428
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one of them must have
slipped me a Mickey.</font>

429
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just glad you're okay.</font>

430
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can pay me back
by helping me</font>

431
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">get all my stuff
from Troy and Abed's.</font>

432
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:22,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're moving again?
How long was I out?</font>

433
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is napster still a thing?</font>

434
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been out long enough
for me to realize</font>

435
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'm gonna need
to keep living alone.</font>

436
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

437
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get you cleaned up.</font>

438
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what the hell?</font>

439
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have brain damage.
Nothing I do counts.</font>

440
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is all my stuff?</font>

441
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, Abed?</font>

442
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all yours.</font>

443
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry.</font>

444
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes we get stuck
in our own little world.</font>

445
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then in that world,
we make even littler worlds.</font>

446
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sometimes there are
tunnels between those worlds.</font>

447
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a subway.
One time a snake.</font>

448
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry.
Do you like it?</font>

449
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, I do.
It's perfect.</font>

450
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can rearrange
the throw pillows.</font>

451
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have them arranged
by size instead of color, but—</font>

452
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I say?</font>

453
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what about
the dreamatorium?</font>

454
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's staying.</font>

455
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dreamatorium is more
important than any of us.</font>

456
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're more important
than our bedroom,</font>

457
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we put the bunk bed
in the blanket fort.</font>

458
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all gay code.</font>

459
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure I'm worth it?</font>

460
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a couple of
things that we were hoping</font>

461
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you'd help us with.</font>

462
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, like where does
the water go in the iron?</font>

463
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's the iron for?</font>

464
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what
gets out kool-aid stains?</font>

465
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we already know
that the opposite</font>

466
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">color kool-aid
doesn't work.</font>

467
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, Troy scraped me when
we were fork-jousting last week</font>

468
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't think
it's healing right.</font>

469
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Abed, that's infected.
- Ew!</font>

470
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Infected. That's the word
I was looking for.</font>

471
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, guys.
- I thought you were sick.</font>

472
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was... n't.</font>

473
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kind of made it up
to get out of helping.</font>

474
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's okay.</font>

475
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is?
- Yeah, it is.</font>

476
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Jeff, did you
know that when it snows</font>

477
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">my eyes become large?</font>

478
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ and the light that
you shine can be seen ♪</font>

479
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tweeted it?</font>

480
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ♪ baby ♪
- He tweeted it!</font>

481
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ A kiss from a Rose
on the grave ♪</font>

482
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ and now that your Rose
is in bloom ♪</font>

483
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:18,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ a light hits the gloom
on the grave ♪</font>

484
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, look out, asteroids!
- That was close.</font>

485
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for getting us
to planet Greendalia</font>

486
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">safely, horsebot 3000.</font>

487
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well—
- Oh, no!</font>

488
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendalia has been overrun
by evil King Blorgon!</font>

489
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:38,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look out, Troyborg!
- Pew pew pew!</font>

490
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! I'm dead.</font>

491
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horsebot 3000, no!
I love you!</font>

492
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:43,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am King Blorgon.</font>

493
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my plan is
to blow up the world!</font>

494
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lasers are
useless against me.</font>

495
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aim for his butt.
It's his only weakness.</font>

496
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pew pew!
- Bam bam!</font>

497
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- We did it!</font>

498
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:55,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace and tranquility have
been restored to Greendalia.</font>

499
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all thanks
to horsebot 3000.</font>

500
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">He belongs to the stars now.</font>

501
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:01,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, five more minutes</font>

502
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:04,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we should probably
put a stop to this, right?</font>

503
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, are you—</font>

504
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">I liked horsebot 3000.</font>
