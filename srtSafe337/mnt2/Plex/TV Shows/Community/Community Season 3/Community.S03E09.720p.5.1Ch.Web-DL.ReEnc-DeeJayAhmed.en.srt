00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?</font>

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question is,
<i>who</i> am I doing this weekend?</font>

3
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:13,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's asking because
he's already forgotten.</font>

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nobody.</font>

5
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm volunteering
at the animal hospital.</font>

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw.
- Animal hospital?</font>

7
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:18,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">The animals are the patients.</font>

8
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes sense.</font>

9
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's
letting me work off</font>

10
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cost
of Daniel's eye surgery.</font>

11
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. You won't spend money
on a name-brand phone,</font>

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you got lasik
for your geriatric cat?</font>

13
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">He only has the one eye, Jeff.</font>

14
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't exactly buy him
a cat monocle, can I?</font>

15
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretentious.</font>

16
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for your information,
this is a totorola.</font>

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and I will be having
a very special Saturday night,</font>

18
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">as in <i>Dark Knight.</i></font>

19
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It came! Our limited-edition,
$299 <i>Dark Knight</i> DVD</font>

20
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">with bonus footage,
special commentary,</font>

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a Christian Bale autograph,</font>

22
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">including a personalized message
of up to four words!</font>

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Abed is Batman now,
Christian Bale."</font>

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's official.
- From the man himself.</font>

25
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.</font>

26
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just to clarify,
if you see this lying out,</font>

27
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still using it,
so you don't have</font>

28
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take it to the kitchen,
dump it out, and wash the bowl.</font>

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this about
your buttered noodles?</font>

30
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say that.</font>

31
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:11,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Into your face!</font>

32
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your tears reveal
your weakness!</font>

33
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it
with those tools and foosball?</font>

34
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.</font>

35
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably a more important
game over there.</font>

36
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:20,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foosball's like the soccer
of ping-pong.</font>

37
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.</font>

38
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, my name
is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.</font>

39
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandfather,
Fletcher Morton Foos,</font>

40
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">invented this game
for one purpose—</font>

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have the loudest,
dumbest thing happen.</font>

42
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're free to return</font>

43
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">to your undoubtedly
hearing-impaired families.</font>

44
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what,
we'll stop playing,</font>

45
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can score a point on us.</font>

46
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:48,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tempting, but then wouldn't
I be playing foosball?</font>

47
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, if so, how would I not
be a loud, weird knob?</font>

48
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free shot.</font>

49
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not even touching
the foosenschaften.</font>

50
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:58,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.</font>

51
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo-yah!</font>

52
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish there was a word
to describe the pleasure I feel</font>

53
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">at viewing misfortune.</font>

54
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Tis the face of a broken man.</font>

55
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff. Smile.</font>

56
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, uh...
- Ooh!</font>

57
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">They, uh, —
they come in a six-pack.</font>

58
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:18,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Give me some more
time in a dream ♪</font>

59
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪</font>

60
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪</font>

61
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:28,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪</font>

62
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:33,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪</font>

00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:38,123

66
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buttered noodles.</font>

67
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:54,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm allowed to throw out
the dust, right?</font>

68
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

69
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?</font>

70
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I...</font>

71
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:27,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

72
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I stepped on it.
- Why?</font>

73
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?</font>

74
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can run out and get
a new one before he gets home.</font>

75
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure, Annie.</font>

76
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">And—and then we just have
to record</font>

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">fake exclusive commentary
by Christian Bale.</font>

78
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:40,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, you first.</font>

79
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">This scene
was a special challenge</font>

80
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to all involved—
- Stop it!</font>

81
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a real option!</font>

82
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The disc
is irreplaceably awesome!</font>

83
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we got
a different disc, and—</font>

84
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, do you know
how many sitcoms</font>

85
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">have done the "secretly replace
a broken, priceless item" thing?</font>

86
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause Abed does.</font>

87
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed knows everything,</font>

88
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know you think you
can think your way out of this</font>

89

<font color="#FFFFFF">with your "thinkiness,"
but don't think too much.</font>

91

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay?
- Okay.</font>

92
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shot this scene on location—</font>

93
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, he's right. It won't work.</font>

94
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey?
What—what are you doing?</font>

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm? Oh.</font>

96
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I just thought...</font>

97
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time those deutsche-bags
try to show off,</font>

98
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe I can catch them
by surprise.</font>

99
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,028

what foreigners think about you.</font>

100
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your birthright
as an American.</font>

101
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay...</font>

102
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small confession.</font>

103
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to love foosball.</font>

104
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a great
after-school game</font>

105
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a lonely kid
with no dad—</font>

106
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, just masculine enough</font>

107
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">without having to know
how to throw or catch.</font>

108
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have seen you throw.</font>

109
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was fun...</font>

110
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Till I started getting bullied
by people like those Germans.</font>

111
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I quit.</font>

112
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you did the right thing.</font>

113
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foosball is a vile game
for vile people.</font>

114
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.</font>

115
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not
a fresh-baked-pie thing.</font>

116
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I might get it a little.</font>

117
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know me.</font>

118
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:42,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho... Ly... Crap.</font>

119
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I think I figured
out the viewing order—</font>

120
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">original version,
director's cut,</font>

121
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">director's cut with commentary,</font>

122
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then original version
cool-down.</font>

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

124
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you guys.</font>

125
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been robbed!</font>

126
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

127
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe we got robbed.</font>

128
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, Shirley.</font>

129
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to teach me.</font>

130
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, help me beat
those evil power krauts.</font>

131
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it, Jeff?</font>

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not evil people
that are good at foosball.</font>

133
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are good at foosball
because they're evil.</font>

134
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an evil game
that brings out the worst in us,</font>

135
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">like—like out-of-town weddings
where the reception's</font>

136
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the same place
as everybody's rooms?</font>

137
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. After three years
of religious advice</font>

138
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">and carb-laden pastries,</font>

139
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">you finally have one thing
I actually need, and—</font>

140
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:33,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

141
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, that was rude.</font>

142
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:39,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">It—it shouldn't be
so important to me.</font>

143
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll, uh...
I'll see you Monday.</font>

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff...</font>

145
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, dawn—</font>

146
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">be in the student lounge.</font>

147
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, you are the best.</font>

148
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear lord, please forgive me.</font>

149
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">And please have mercy on him.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
My necklace.</font>

213
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:09,662

white gold—</font>

for the report,</font>

224
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I ever pretend to shoot
a guy in front of you</font>

225
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">to teach you about gun safety?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really good at faces.</font>

227
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess
the only upside to this is</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">If there was no forced entry,
it had to be an inside job.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash,</font>

00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">pharmaceuticals, laptops,
they take what?</font>

233
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Batman DVD, and one piece</font>

234
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">of oddly ornate
Hebrew-themed jewelry?</font>

235
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.</font>

236
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?</font>

237
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:58,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I know
what happened here.</font>

238
00:09:58,095 --> 00:09:59,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I—</font>

239
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">The landlord did it.</font>

240
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all makes sense.</font>

241
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rick has keys
to every apartment—means.</font>

242
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows when we're coming
and going—opportunity.</font>

243
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was dressed as the Joker
for Halloween—motive.</font>

244
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:12,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.</font>

245
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, let's not leap
to thing-doing.</font>

246
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Annie?</font>

247
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double strike.</font>

248
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:23,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

249
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back blast.</font>

250
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom!</font>

251
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viper shot.</font>

252
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nailed it!
- Oh, look...</font>

253
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">How cute—
you do like foosball,</font>

254
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">you just have to practice
with your mama.</font>

255
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing here
on a Saturday night?</font>

256
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be making
weird art movies</font>

257
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!</font>

258
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">We came to play.
Get away from our table.</font>

259
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.</font>

260
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then play us for it.</font>

261
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
Monday morning—</font>

262
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">only let's make it interesting.</font>

263
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">The losers never get to use
this table again.</font>

264
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you are so on
that things have now</font>

265
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">become very much like
<i>Donkey Kong.</i></font>

266
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna kick das butt.</font>

267
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice.
- Thank you.</font>

268
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough teutonic punnery.</font>

269
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monday morning you get this...</font>

270
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you guys walking around
with a soccer ball</font>

271
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so you could do that?</font>

272
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">They left the ball
and everything.</font>

273
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they were literally
walking around with it</font>

274
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a prop to use.</font>

275
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, like, a $25 dollar bit,
and it's not even that good.</font>

276
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have got
to come clean, okay?</font>

277
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what he's doing
in there, but it feels dramatic.</font>

278
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:28,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure he's already moved on
to some other obsession.</font>

279
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, fun.</font>

280
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:33,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are powerless.</font>

281
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must take justice
into my own hands.</font>

282
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men like Rick operate
above the law.</font>

283
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's something else
above the law...</font>

284
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bats...</font>

285
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:45,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And me.</font>

286
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, don't do
anything drastic.</font>

287
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe we should
all just take a step back and—</font>

288
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, is that the grappling hook
I got you for Christmas?</font>

289
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night beckons.</font>

290
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Its black fingers
curl and uncurl,</font>

291
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">going, like,
"hey, come here."</font>

292
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, wait!</font>

293
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. I did it.</font>

294
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stepped on your DVD,
and it broke,</font>

295
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I staged
a break-in to cover it up.</font>

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that were true,</font>

297
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would've come forward
a long time ago.</font>

298
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:13,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying to keep me
out of danger.</font>

299
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there can be no peace</font>

300
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">while crime spits and dances
on the grave of justice</font>

301
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the hot beats
of infectious rhythms</font>

302
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">of all that is wrong.</font>

303
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Just...</font>

304
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!</font>

305
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're okay—okay.</font>

306
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

307
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed...</font>

308
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Oh!</font>

309
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy!
What are we gonna do?</font>

310
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're open to input?</font>

311
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm following him.</font>

312
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:43,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You moving in here
was supposed to tone us down.</font>

313
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Shirley, tell me—</font>

314
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">how does someone
with your talent for foosball</font>

315
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:49,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever stop playing?</font>

316
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't want to talk
about that.</font>

317
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, we're, like,
best friends now.</font>

318
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.</font>

319
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well...</font>

320
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a kid,
I had anger, Jeff—</font>

321
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">real bad anger—
and foosball was a release.</font>

322
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I didn't just—
just beat people.</font>

323
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I broke 'em.</font>

324
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time I was running
this table</font>

325
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">over at this Y.M.C.A
across town,</font>

326
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:12,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was really giving it
to this kid—</font>

327
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:14,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">this skinny little white boy,
no offense.</font>

328
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He started crying.
They always started crying.</font>

329
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">But something about this boy</font>

330
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">made me want to take it
all the way.</font>

331
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:23,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I started jabbing him
with the rods until...</font>

332
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy peed himself.</font>

333
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody laughed.
I laughed.</font>

334
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after that,
the game lost its flavor.</font>

335
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you make
a boy pee his pants,</font>

336
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">you start thinking
about where your life is headed.</font>

337
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:41,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, what's wrong?</font>

338
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna kill you!</font>

339
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:44,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ass is mine!</font>

340
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such a punk!</font>

341
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like being beat by a girl?</font>

342
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

343
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you crying for?</font>

344
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mama cannot help you,</font>

345
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know your daddy
ain't around,</font>

346
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you wouldn't play
like a bitch.</font>

347
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

348
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

349
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?</font>

350
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just beat this kid
all the way to tinkle-town.</font>

351
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tinkle-town, tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town.</font>

352
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town,</font>

353
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:21,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">tinkle-town, tinkle-town.</font>

354
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were Big Cheddar?</font>

355
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who told you that—</font>

356
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:29,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear lord.</font>

357
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're tinkle-town?</font>

358
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me that.</font>

359
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">All your fake sweetness
and religion</font>

360
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">is just a veil covering
a horrible monster.</font>

361
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:44,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I had a lot
of Mountain Dew that day!</font>

362
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's an 80 percent chance</font>

363
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:55,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't leave Woodstock
until you bone these hippies.</font>

364
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy.</font>

365
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

366
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I came for, scum.</font>

367
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:18,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it?</font>

368
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the closet.
In the closet, man.</font>

369
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!</font>

370
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, stop it.</font>

371
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're in the closet.</font>

372
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:28,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.</font>

373
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Closet.</font>

374
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women's shoes?</font>

375
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Rick doesn't have a wife...</font>

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or women's feet.</font>

377
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?</font>

378
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I lost these
in the move.</font>

379
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?</font>

380
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The what?
- The DVD.</font>

381
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has it, all right.</font>

382
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it looks like he broke it.</font>

383
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

384
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

385
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had something to say,</font>

386
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">why not put it
in the text message?</font>

387
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:08,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure what to say.</font>

388
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand</font>

389
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you did to me...
Big Cheddar?</font>

390
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:14,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't call me that.</font>

391
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:16,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?
It's what you are—</font>

392
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">a mean, nasty bully.</font>

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 12 years old.</font>

394
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I peed!</font>

395
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to change schools.</font>

396
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:25,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I changed everything—</font>

397
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">my clothes, my hair,
my personality—</font>

398
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of you.</font>

399
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a waste.</font>

400
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could take a picture
of you right now</font>

401
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">and send it
to my ten-year-old self.</font>

402
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it, Winger.</font>

403
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a trademark
on self-pity.</font>

404
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will defend myself.
- Good.</font>

405
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the cheddar...</font>

406
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big Cheddar.</font>

407
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna put you
on the express train</font>

408
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">back to tinkle-town!</font>

409
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Argh!
- Uh!</font>

410
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:01,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh!
Aah!</font>

411
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh!
- Aah!</font>

412
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:07,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

413
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

414
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

415
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Die!
- Never!</font>

416
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh!</font>

417
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Argh!</font>

418
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:35,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

419
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You get it.
- No, you get it.</font>

420
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one
that needs the advantage.</font>

421
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong. Wrong!</font>

422
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every game I ever won,
I won fairly.</font>

423
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foosball was how I measured
my value as a man.</font>

424
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:46,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took that away!</font>

425
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do think I had to?</font>

426
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You try sprouting three feet</font>

427
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">just when boys
are about to look at you.</font>

428
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone stopped liking me.</font>

429
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">This game is all I had.</font>

430
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.</font>

431
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a perfectly fine person.</font>

432
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:00,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">So are you.</font>

433
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

434
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

435
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Jeff.</font>

436
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:16,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have anything
to be sorry for, Shirley.</font>

437
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Rick has agreed to stay
out of your apartment</font>

438
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">as long as you stay out of his.</font>

439
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm getting tired
of saying this to people,</font>

440
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">but these things
wouldn't happen</font>

441
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:24,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you'd invest
in a simple shoe safe.</font>

442
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?</font>

443
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we just live upstairs
from this...</font>

444
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy that's really
into footwear?</font>

445
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:32,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, you're a renter.</font>

446
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:34,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look forward to owning a house.</font>

447
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be glad he's not into heads.</font>

448
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for your help, officer,</font>

449
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if you should ever need me,</font>

450
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:41,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I usually get out
of school around 4:00.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">This guys sleeps outside your
room, though, and that's okay?</font>

452
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:45,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

453
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one thing
I don't understand.</font>

454
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would Rick deny
taking my DVD?</font>

455
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why break it?</font>

456
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe he stepped on it
by accident</font>

457
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:59,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">and felt really,
really, really bad.</font>

458
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the more reason to confess.</font>

459
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not everybody's
perfect, Abed.</font>

460
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman. And I am.</font>

461
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Batman,</font>

462
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">on behalf of all of us
that aren't perfect,</font>

463
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:12,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">can I just say
I'm sorry I broke your DVD?</font>

464
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apology accepted.</font>

465
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wouldn't mention it
to Abed.</font>

466
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's pretty ruthless.</font>

467
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's coming from Batman.</font>

468
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:26,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

469
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, where have you been?</font>

470
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, really?</font>

471
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it go.</font>

472
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, black in the house!</font>

473
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.</font>

474
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:40,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.</font>

479
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the ball, Karl.</font>

480
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying,
and stop yelling at me.</font>

481
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop being such a schvine!</font>

482
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:12,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you guys
playing foosball?</font>

483
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've played enough
for one lifetime.</font>

484
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna go see a movie.</font>

485
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when are those two
so close?</font>
