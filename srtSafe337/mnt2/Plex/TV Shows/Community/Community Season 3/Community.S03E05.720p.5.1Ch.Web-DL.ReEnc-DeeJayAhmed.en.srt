can have a dip too!</font>

00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:07,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't be afraid
to play with the...</font>

00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:10,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ruuubber spiiider!</font>

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll ask again...</font>

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:14,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure
I can't bring anything?</font>

6
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

7
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:16,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're having a party,</font>

8
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:18,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">before we're going
to the real party?</font>

9
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, I think
you young people</font>

10
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:20,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">are just making this crap up.</font>

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pre-party!</font>

12
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's informal, intimate,</font>

13
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:24,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just for us.</font>

14
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I told you guys
you didn't have to dress up.</font>

15
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:28,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we were wearing this
when you called.</font>

16
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:31,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, when we dress up,
you'll know it.</font>

17
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing in your
playlist but spooky party,</font>

18
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:36,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Beetlejuice soundtrack,
and NPR podcasts.</font>

19
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:37,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh! We could listen
to one of those!</font>

20
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have Michele Norris</font>

21
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:41,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">interviewing Errol Morris.</font>

22
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, they address it.</font>

23
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's make this quick.</font>

24
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:49,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got three more polite
appearances to make tonight.</font>

25
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I'm one of the
Fast and Furious guys.</font>

26
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:52,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one?</font>

27
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:53,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.
I don't watch that shallow crap.</font>

28
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:56,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just pick
a costume girls will like.</font>

29
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, can I have
a quick conversation with you?</font>

30
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doubtful,
but I support the dream.</font>

31
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember last week,
when I made you guys fill out</font>

32
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">those anonymous personality
tests for my psych class?</font>

33
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, if you dropped them
in another puddle—</font>

34
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:12,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I processed the results,
as per my assignment.</font>

35
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:16,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Jeff,
one of our friends is...</font>

36
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deeply disturbed.</font>

37
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:20,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trick or Dean!</font>

38
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:23,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget to come by our
Halloween scare-tacular dance,</font>

39
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:25,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting in
the cafeteria at 9:30.</font>

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I had the lights
rigged to flicker</font>

41
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's Halloween!</font>

42
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:33,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the lights will work
on November 1st?</font>

43
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:36,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Saint's day...</font>

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Month!</font>

45
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:40,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, you were
about to get ridiculous?</font>

46
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

47
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:42,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the tests came back</font>

48
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">with 70 out of 75 red flags</font>

49
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an extreme
personality disorder.</font>

50
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:48,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extreme, Jeff!</font>

51
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a dorito?</font>

52
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sociopathic dorito.</font>

53
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cool ranch lunatic.</font>

54
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only instead of Zest, Jeff,</font>

55
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">one member
of our study group has...</font>

56
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Homicidal tendencies.</font>

57
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think one member
of our study group</font>

58
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">is an overzealous psych major.</font>

59
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably just Britta'd
the test results somehow.</font>

60
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I double-checked them.</font>

61
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

62
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are people using my name</font>

63
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">to mean "make a small mistake"?</font>

64
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

65
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:25,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪</font>

66
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪</font>

67
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:31,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪</font>

68
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:35,924

tied up, dead in a year ♪</font>

69
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:40,729

00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make this party
fast and furious,</font>

73
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:52,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">in that order.</font>

74
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I want to go
to the dance.</font>

75
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard the Dean's got
free taco meat from the army.</font>

76
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:56,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can go
to the dance in a bit.</font>

77
00:02:56,996 --> 00:03:01,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, why don't
we tell some scaaary stories?</font>

78
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good!</font>

79
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll start with a story
about a horrible fate</font>

80
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">befalling innocent people,</font>

81
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I'm curious
to get individual reactions.</font>

82
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:13,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once upon a time,</font>

83
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a couple
in a car in the woods</font>

84
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:17,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">making out or something.</font>

85
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I heard something.</font>

86
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:21,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the sound
of my heart, baby.</font>

87
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

88
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">An escaped convict
from the asylum has escaped,</font>

89
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:29,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's mental
and he's on the loose and stuff.</font>

90
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
That sounds dangerous.</font>

91
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sure it's no biggie,</font>

92
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:34,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I am a horny man.</font>

93
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only half-present.</font>

94
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was last seen in the woods
and has a thingy for a hand,</font>

95
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">a hook thing
where his hand should be.</font>

96
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:42,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what I mean.
- That sounds dangerous.</font>

97
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, I'll get out and look.</font>

98
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I'm entitled to sex.</font>

99
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting stabbed
with his hook hand thing.</font>

100
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! No!</font>

101
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was right!</font>

102
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the woman
was screaming and screaming</font>

103
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the man got killed.</font>

104
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed?
- Yep?</font>

105
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did that story
make you feel?</font>

106
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Embarrassed.
- That's an odd reaction.</font>

107
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems fair.</font>

108
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:09,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">What embarrassed you about it?</font>

109
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't care
about the characters.</font>

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't care about them?</font>

111
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:13,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were stupid.</font>

112
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">They deliberately
put themselves in danger,</font>

113
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:16,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, when they
were warned about it,</font>

114
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:17,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">the guy got out of the car.</font>

115
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe
because he was stupid</font>

116
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:19,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">he deserved to die?</font>

117
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:21,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
kind of party is this?</font>

118
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:22,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose,
from a creative standpoint,</font>

119
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">some characters deserve to die.</font>

120
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ones that lack common sense
or even basic survival instinct.</font>

121
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:27,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your story's not scary
because the characters</font>

122
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">are making choices
the audience wouldn't make.</font>

123
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, you need a smarter lead.
Here, like this.</font>

124
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a dark, cold night
in the woods.</font>

125
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">We establish
a traditional log cabin,</font>

126
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">then cut to—</font>

127
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are, a log cabin
I rented so we could be</font>

128
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">intimate in safety,
because it's not the 50s,</font>

129
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we don't have to park a car
and neck at inspiration point.</font>

130
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes sense.</font>

131
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm turned on
by how logical you are.</font>

132
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm comforted by your
shiny hair and facial symmetry.</font>

133
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just brushed my teeth,</font>

134
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">so this would be
the optimal time to kiss.</font>

135
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoyable. Soft lips.</font>

136
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:54,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the right
level of moisture.</font>

137
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Would you like to do it again?
- No.</font>

138
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should listen
to the news on this radio.</font>

139
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought it
as a cautionary measure,</font>

140
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">because this cabin
is within walking distance</font>

141
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the local insane asylum.</font>

142
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:04,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that why
you were able to rent it</font>

143
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">- at such a reasonable rate?
- Yes.</font>

144
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're as fertile
as I am tonight.</font>

145
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- More.
- Ahh.</font>

146
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:30,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

147
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing
the whole song?</font>

148
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:33,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wouldn't turn
the radio on at the exact moment</font>

149
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the most pertinent
news broadcast.</font>

150
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too coincidental.</font>

151
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:37,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'll jump forward in time.</font>

152
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that noise?</font>

153
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Based on the news report
we just heard,</font>

154
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not just just heard,</font>

155
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume it's the deranged,
hook-handed killer, who escaped</font>

156
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the asylum's antiquated
security system failed.</font>

157
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess they
shouldn't have cut corners,</font>

158
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">although it is understandable,</font>

159
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:50,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">given the recent
economic downturn.</font>

160
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we go check it out?</font>

161
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We should call 911</font>

162
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">on my fully-charged cell phone,</font>

163
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">lock the doors,
and then stand back to back</font>

164
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the middle of the room
holding knives.</font>

165
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you—
- Shh.</font>

166
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

167
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did these people
ever die or what?</font>

168
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:17,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, once it had been...</font>

169
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:19,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eaaarned.</font>

170
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:20,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Britta...</font>

171
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like you're
barking up the wrong tree.</font>

172
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
You want to hear a scary story?</font>

173
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a scary story.</font>

174
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for pulling me
from that carriage.</font>

175
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what could have
frightened my horses so.</font>

176
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:38,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many vile creatures
make these woods their home.</font>

177
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some even warn of...
Monsters.</font>

178
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe in monsters.</font>

179
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe every man
has good within.</font>

180
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:48,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must retrieve my books
from the debris tomorrow.</font>

181
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:50,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a schoolteacher,</font>

182
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and many children rely
on me to educate them.</font>

183
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be gone, innocent one!</font>

184
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:55,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong?</font>

185
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may choose
not to believe in them,</font>

186
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:01,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I am a monster.</font>

187
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I must feed.</font>

188
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:07,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not judge me
for my weakness.</font>

189
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stifle your slackened maw,</font>

190
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:12,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">you drained
and tainted bitch dog.</font>

191
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:14,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine with this.</font>

192
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

193
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

194
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teach me to read.</font>

195
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

196
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:24,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wo...</font>

197
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sound it out.</font>

198
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:29,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wo... Rd dog</font>

199
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">hates... Cats.</font>

200
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh reason not the need!</font>

201
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our basest beggars are in the
poorest things superfluous."</font>

202
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Yes! Yes!</font>

203
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:43,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be proud of
how much I've changed you.</font>

204
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for helping me,</font>

205
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:47,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm afraid some monsters</font>

206
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:48,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">cannot change.</font>

207
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

208
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resist your craving!</font>

209
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pick up a good book</font>

210
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:56,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">and read!</font>

211
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:57,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your porcelain neck,</font>

212
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the light of the full moon,</font>

213
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:02,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">too appetizing.</font>

214
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunate...</font>

215
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you.</font>

216
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see,
some monsters cannot change.</font>

217
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But others can.</font>

218
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

219
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a werewolf</font>

220
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:18,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">that feeds on selfish vampires.</font>

221
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she ripped into his torso,</font>

222
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a gerbil shredding
a quaker oats box,</font>

223
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">sending chunks of viscera</font>

224
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:33,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an aerosol mist of blood
all over the skanky concubine.</font>

225
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, she flossed her teeth
with his tendons.</font>

226
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, because he was a vampire,</font>

227
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">he lived through all of it.</font>

228
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had to watch
her swallow his last eyeball.</font>

229
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">She kept it attached
to the optic nerve,</font>

230
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he could see
down her throat,</font>

231
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">to his own
partially digested flesh</font>

232
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">in... Her... Stomach.</font>

233
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? There was a twist.</font>

234
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, Annie.</font>

235
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you were
such a fan of... Gore.</font>

236
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Halloween.</font>

237
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're gonna
tell a scary story,</font>

238
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- give it some texture.
- Wasn't that great.</font>

239
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, your texture was so</font>

240
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">discompassionately macabre,</font>

241
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if without the slightest
regard for human life.</font>

242
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:31,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.
Stop pinning ribbons to her.</font>

243
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:32,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does Annie get
to be good at everything?</font>

244
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:37,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys wanna hear
a real, legit scary story?</font>

245
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

246
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anyone here?</font>

247
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need help.</font>

248
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.
An old doctor.</font>

249
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and my partner
are top gun fighter pilots,</font>

250
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">the best of the best.</font>

251
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pew pew pew.</font>

252
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:49,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our F-15 went down
in the woods.</font>

253
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:53,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I heard
something awesome out there.</font>

254
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, come in,</font>

255
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:57,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">for first aids
and what have you.</font>

256
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, drinks from a stranger.</font>

257
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">So medical.
Thank you.</font>

258
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh.</font>

259
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wakey-wakey.</font>

260
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

261
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cabin is my lab,</font>

262
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I do
weird experiments on people.</font>

263
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

264
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noo!</font>

265
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forced to be together forever!</font>

266
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sewed you together.</font>

267
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I totally sewed you together!</font>

268
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

269
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we're sewn together,</font>

270
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">do we have E.S.P.?</font>

271
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:38,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! We're psychic now.</font>

272
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can destroy him
with mind powers.</font>

273
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

274
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:58,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tried to destroy us...</font>

275
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you only made us...</font>

276
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:01,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">More awesome!</font>

277
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I'm a j-jealous.</font>

278
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:11,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you are the subject.</font>

279
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What?
Tell me more.</font>

280
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sewed your butt</font>

281
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">to your chest! Ha!</font>

282
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noo!</font>

283
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

284
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! You fools!</font>

285
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">By sewing my butt to my chest,</font>

286
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've given me boobs
I can touch all day.</font>

287
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">With what?</font>

288
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noo!</font>

289
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

290
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:38,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noo!</font>

291
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nooo!</font>

292
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nooo!</font>

293
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feet hands.</font>

294
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:47,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I do to deserve that?</font>

295
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep me out of
your stupid stories.</font>

296
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:50,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say it was you.</font>

297
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said he was
a crazy, old, racist doctor.</font>

298
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:56,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I'm your
crazy, old, racist friend.</font>

299
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was, anyway.
Now I'm not so sure.</font>

300
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:59,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a story, Pierce.</font>

301
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:01,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well so is this.</font>

302
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back to bed, Magnum.</font>

303
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a moment, girls.</font>

304
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:10,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just enjoying an
expensive, post-coital Brandy.</font>

305
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.</font>

306
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whats we gots heres?</font>

307

<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a home invasion,

308
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, easy, easy.</font>

309
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:23,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody has to get hurt here.</font>

310
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's right, honky.</font>

311
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take it real easy</font>

312
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">and give us all your
expensive Brandy and hubcaps.</font>

313
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but...</font>

314
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

315
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

316
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... Are...</font>

317
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still... Relevant!</font>

318
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!
Unh!</font>

319
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm ready
for my birthday spanking.</font>

320
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which of you girls
knows how to count to 30?</font>

321
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... in the hell...</font>

322
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that?</font>

323
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't even a ghost story.</font>

324
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like
an episode of some show</font>

325
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're all too young
to have heard of.</font>

326
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine! Then I chopped up
both your bodies.</font>

327
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that was us,
and you were Magnum?</font>

328
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still am, Pakistan.
Wanna try me?</font>

329
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I think these stories
are starting to get personal.</font>

330
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:13,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so needlessly violent.</font>

331
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to the days
when ghost stories</font>

332
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">were about good versus evil?</font>

333
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once upon a time...</font>

334
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man.
My drugs are wearing off.</font>

335
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's got more?
- Ha ha!</font>

336
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go, baby.</font>

337
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right.</font>

338
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is my kind of pot bong.</font>

339
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Jango, check it out.</font>

340
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:42,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swarms of locusts</font>

341
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tornadoes of frogs.</font>

342
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.
I lived in New York.</font>

343
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!
It's like New York out there.</font>

344
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We interrupt your death metal</font>

345

got raptured up to heaven,</font>

347
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if you're hearing this,</font>

348
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">the good news is you're
the coolest people in the world.</font>

349
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:07,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

350
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bad news is
the world is over.</font>

351
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:10,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is NPR.</font>

352
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man. End of days?</font>

353
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:16,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could anything suck
harder than this?</font>

354
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:19,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hel-lo!</font>

355
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:20,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Devil here.</font>

356
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just popping by with a little
damnation orientation.</font>

357
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the sched.</font>

358
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">At 10:00, you'll be buried
neck-deep in scorpions.</font>

359
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">11:15, lava enemas,
followed by pilates.</font>

360
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:31,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. That's good.
- I like pilates.</font>

361
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pilates is a demon
that eats your genitals.</font>

362
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first,</font>

363
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">stabby-stabby.</font>

364
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

365
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">For whom do ye cry out?</font>

366
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the good people are gone!</font>

367
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

368
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:49,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Look!</font>

369
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's our friend we used
to pick on for being Christian.</font>

370
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she looks great.</font>

371
00:14:56,821 --> 00:15:00,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">A righteous wind blows!</font>

372
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off to pilates!</font>

373
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you
for saving us, Shirley.</font>

374
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, your name's
not Shirley,</font>

375
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:09,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is a story about strangers.</font>

376
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyhoo, can you take us
to heaven now, please?</font>

377
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I cannot.</font>

378
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:18,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just came to say good-bye
on my way to Abraham's bosom.</font>

379
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

380
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgive you.</font>

381
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:29,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay marriage!</font>

382
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he chainsawed them to bits!</font>

383
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he put 'em back together.</font>

384
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he chainsawed
them again!</font>

385
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forever.</font>

386
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was Jeff in that story?</font>

387
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why was my name Jango?</font>

388
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:48,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, that wasn't a horror story.</font>

389
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:49,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a sermon.</font>

390
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ruined a Britta party.</font>

391
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like letting poop spoil.</font>

392
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Wait!</font>

393
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

394
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can leave
until we figure this out.</font>

395
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:02,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figure what out?</font>

396
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long story short,</font>

397
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">those psych tests
I made you take came back.</font>

398
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:09,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out one of you
is probably a homicidal maniac.</font>

399
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's stupid.</font>

400
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a responsibility,</font>

401
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a practitioner
of the mental arts,</font>

402
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">to figure out
which one of you is sick,</font>

403
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get you the treatment
you need.</font>

404
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:20,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a danger to yourself and
others in your current state.</font>

405
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've known each other
for two years.</font>

406
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us are murderers.</font>

407
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but one of you
has the potential.</font>

408
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:28,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we leave here now,
do you know what might happen?</font>

409
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:58,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta,
what are you describing?</font>

410
00:16:58,109 --> 00:16:59,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

411
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who has those images
like that in their head?</font>

412
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:03,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably the same kind
of person that would make us</font>

413
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell ghost stories in order
to secretly study our minds.</font>

414
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just worried
that one of you—</font>

415
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:10,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us? You took
that test too, right?</font>

416
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:12,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What are you saying?</font>

417
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

418
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:18,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it is me?</font>

419
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. This is crazy!</font>

420
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting freaked out
because it's Halloween,</font>

421
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">we just need to settle down.</font>

422
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you!</font>

423
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want
to be barium sulfated!</font>

424
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa!
- Stay back, psychos!</font>

425
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I'll slit your throats
and bathe in your blood.</font>

426
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!
What has happened to all of you?</font>

427
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard all the stories.</font>

428
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone here could be
a... Psycho!</font>

429
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thinking that is what's psycho.</font>

430
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, I have a story
that I think might help.</font>

431
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:53,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whee!
- Cheers.</font>

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Wait!</font>

433
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you do anything,</font>

434
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell us why you kill people.</font>

435
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear.</font>

436
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kill because I'm afraid.</font>

437
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:10,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody, please, give me a hug.</font>

438
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:11,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww!</font>

439
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in here.</font>

440
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love hugs. Love hugs.</font>

441
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it out.
It's okay?</font>

442
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

443
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the gayest crap</font>

444
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've ever heard in my life.</font>

445
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Jeff.
What the hell?</font>

446
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you always
so determined to have us relax</font>

447
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:28,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put down our weapons?</font>

448
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's a remorseless
madman with no empathy,</font>

449
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">who eludes detection
by manipulating others.</font>

450
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Jeff.</font>

451
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should go through
your test answers one by one.</font>

452
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.
I filled mine out randomly.</font>

453
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, come on.
- What?</font>

454
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You idiot!</font>

455
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:46,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was probably the test that
returned the psychotic result!</font>

456
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Maybe.</font>

457
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what kind of sociopath
doesn't offer that information,</font>

458
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:50,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, an hour ago?</font>

459
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.
I'm no sociopath.</font>

460
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always know
what I'm doing is wrong.</font>

461
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a guy that doesn't
like taking tests, doing work,</font>

462
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:58,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">or getting yelled at.</font>

463
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you think about it,</font>

464
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:01,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">that makes me
the sanest person here.</font>

465
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo!</font>

466
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:06,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your test or what?</font>

467
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">How should I know?
It's just a bunch of bubbles.</font>

468
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:08,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

469
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me those.</font>

470
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are the scores
on the bottoms of the sheets?</font>

471
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should—</font>

472
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, look at the arrow.</font>

473
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ran these through
the machine upside-down.</font>

474
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">She Britta'd it.</font>

475
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:24,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.
I'll run them through again.</font>

476
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:26,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you guys
are gonna stop using my name</font>

477
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:31,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">to mean "making a tiny
and understandable mistake."</font>

478
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're all insane.</font>

479
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:42,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, except for this person.</font>

480
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:43,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that one mine?</font>

481
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should probably
figure it out, right?</font>

482
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">If one of us
isn't crazy, it's only fair</font>

483
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:48,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the rest of us
know who they are.</font>

484
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we could hold on
to the comforting notion</font>

485
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:53,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">t-that any one of us
m-might be sane.</font>

486
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Okay.</font>

487
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We learned
an important lesson tonight.</font>

488
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should never make the Britta</font>

489
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:02,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Britta-ing
each other's feelings.</font>

490
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:03,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're using it wrong.</font>

491
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
You Britta'd "Britta'd."</font>

492
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, way to pull an Abed.
- I don't get it.</font>

493
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:08,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, don't Pierce.</font>

494
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

495
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not get it.</font>

496
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, it's been three days!</font>

497
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">When are you gonna let me go?</font>

498
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:33,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least say something!</font>

499
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:34,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

500
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys!</font>

501
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we let him go?</font>

502
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm... Let me think.</font>

503
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.
More Brandy?</font>

504
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:44,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind if I do.</font>

505
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm... That's terrible.</font>

506
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we get back
in our F-15 that we repaired</font>

507
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">with our mind power?</font>

508
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:50,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking the same thing!</font>

509
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:51,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know!</font>

510
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:52,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jinx!
Double jinx!</font>

511
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:53,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Triple jinx!</font>
