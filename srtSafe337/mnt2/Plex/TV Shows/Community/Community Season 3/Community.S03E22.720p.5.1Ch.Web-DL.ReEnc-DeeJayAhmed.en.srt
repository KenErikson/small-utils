<font color="#FFFFFF">by ratting on you
to the state bar?</font>

150
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee.</font>

151
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is this a conflict of interest?</font>

152
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Alan working
at your former firm and all?</font>

153
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Pierce just did you
the biggest favor of your life.</font>

154
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hired a guy I've spent
the last two years fantasizing</font>

155
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:44,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">about stabbing
in the... Sundance!</font>

156
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tango!
- Hey.</font>

157
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:50,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... The case
of the sandwich signature.</font>

158
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

159
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:52,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, me, I have to, but you?</font>

160
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorne's a cash cow,</font>

161
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">and old a-con here
is tugging at that teat.</font>

162
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's money.</font>

163
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:01,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money.</font>

164
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stop that.</font>

165
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:06,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">So full disclosure.
The firm would really like</font>

166
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:09,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep vitamin "p"
in its medicine chest.</font>

167
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:10,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Full disclosure.</font>

168
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really want to be
done by 4:00.</font>

169
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:14,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's the Jeff
wing basket I remember loving.</font>

170
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, just go easy on Shirley.</font>

171
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scout's honor, Sinead O'Connor.</font>

172
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oy-yay, oy-yay, the honorable
Craig Pelton presiding.</font>

173
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:24,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">First off,
there's one decision</font>

174
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need your help making.</font>

175
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,550
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Judging Amy or Judge Judy?</i></font>

176
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say your name is Evil Abed,</font>

177
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">which does not throw me,
because I'm a therapist.</font>

178
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's talk about evil.</font>

179
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? Maybe I should
talk to Good Abed instead.</font>

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I come from,
his name is Lame Abed.</font>

181
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you come from...
- The darkest timeline.</font>

182
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might call it
the Britta of timelines,</font>

183
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">where everything is the worst.</font>

184
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff has one arm there.
Annie shot Pierce.</font>

185
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy can't speak...
- Ah!</font>

186
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:57,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're getting somewhere.
I think lame Abed sent you</font>

187
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">to talk because you're more
equipped to deal with fear.</font>

188
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the lame way
of seeing it, yes.</font>

189
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:04,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the truth.</font>

190
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've crossed
into your dark timeline,</font>

191
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:07,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I'm going to darken it.</font>

192
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:09,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

193
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about
your parents, Britta.</font>

194
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:14,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... No?</font>

195
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barnes, you should be
in the chapel.</font>

196
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost a great man today.</font>

197
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:21,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he was the best,
wasn't he?</font>

198
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I don't understand</font>

199
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">how he could rupture
a freon line.</font>

200
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's kind of
a rookie mistake.</font>

201
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it was just
a faulty valve.</font>

202
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:30,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">My first order as vice Dean,</font>

203
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have them
all replaced.</font>

204
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're vice Dean now?</font>

205
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:35,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the sudden interest
in air conditioning repair?</font>

206
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:36,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you missed
your friends.</font>

207
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:38,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do.
- Then go be with them.</font>

208
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:39,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm releasing you.</font>

209
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:41,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you...
- Goodbye, Troy.</font>

210
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Edison, do you recognize
the baby in that picture?</font>

211
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Shirley's baby Ben.</font>

212
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you think less
of Shirley Bennett</font>

213
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:58,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she offered
to sell Ben on craigslist</font>

214
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a chance
to bump it with Denzel?</font>

215
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:03,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a joke for my cousin.</font>

216
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:05,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn those Facebook
privacy settings.</font>

217
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff, do something.
- He's got nothing.</font>

218
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she didn't mean that.</font>

219
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:12,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or perhaps she doesn't
even love that baby,</font>

220
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:16,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she spent most
of last year not even knowing</font>

221
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">who the father is.
- Objection.</font>

222
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Establishing character,
your honor.</font>

223
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">This woman is clearly unfit
to own a sandwich shop.</font>

224
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, come on.</font>

225
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">No furths.</font>

226
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said
you were gonna go easy.</font>

227
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Felt easy to me.</font>

228
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was he wearing?</font>

229
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was dressed as a dinosaur.</font>

230
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you dropped
out of High School?</font>

231
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:39,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

232
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are those even real glasses?
- No.</font>

233
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, do you feel that, Britta?</font>

234
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your timeline's 10% darker now.
- This was 10%?</font>

235
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what kind of person
becomes a psychologist, Britta?</font>

236
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">A person that wishes,
deep down,</font>

237
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">that everyone more special
than them was sick,</font>

238
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">because "healthy" sounds so much
more exciting than "boring."</font>

239
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're average, Britta Perry.</font>

240
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're every kid
on the playground</font>

241
00:09:58,572 --> 00:09:59,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">that didn't get picked on.</font>

242
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a business casual
potted plant,</font>

243
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">a human white sale.</font>

244

and Back to the Future 3.</i></font>

245
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,798

of a square cheese pizza.</font>

246
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:09,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, that
sounds delicious.</font>

247
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the center slice
of a square cheese pizza.</font>

248

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Jim Belushi.</font>

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">12%</font>

251
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

252
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make this timeline
the darkest of all.</font>

253
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting with your lame hero,
Jeff Winger.</font>

254
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose lame Abed
owns a bone saw.</font>

255
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Pierce, you're seeking
full ownership</font>

256
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Shirley's Sandwiches.</font>

257
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:52,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, you did provide
100% of the financing.</font>

258
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:52,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.</font>

259
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:56,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really did?
Oh, damn it.</font>

260
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez, I came to this
thing unprepared.</font>

261
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:01,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I-I guess it's my job
to somehow tarnish you</font>

262
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the eyes of the court,
but, uh...</font>

263
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me check my notes.
- Take your time.</font>

264
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:07,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

265
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, while
I'm doing this...</font>

266
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody know
any funny jokes?</font>

267
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

268
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:18,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">An Irish and a Jew walk
into a Chinese laundry...</font>

269
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a gay duck.</font>

270
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:21,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, okay!
- Oh, right!</font>

271
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're telling me they're
not good at basketball?</font>

272
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:25,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no questions,
your honor.</font>

273
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cruel.
Cruel, cruel, cruel.</font>

274
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name

<font color="#FFFFFF">I hereby proclaim you...</font>

278
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ceremony is a lie.</font>

279
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">And having
a special room for it</font>

280
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:53,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a waste
of valuable floor space.</font>

281
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no longer
a student here.</font>

282
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we use this room
for yoga on weekends.</font>

283
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remove him.
- I am the truest repairman.</font>

284
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this man is a dishonor</font>

285
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">to making air conditioners
work good.</font>

286
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have the right
to challenge him...</font>

287
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the sun chamber.</font>

288
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

289
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:16,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your less than honor,
can I call a recess?</font>

290
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:17,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, yay, costume change.</font>

291
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Court briefly adjourned.</font>

292
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,099

to do, Winger?</font>

293
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zealously represent
your client?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me make things
a little easier for you.</font>

295
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figure out a way
to throw this case,</font>

296
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">or figure out
where you're gonna work</font>

297
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you get out of here,
because I don't know</font>

298
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:34,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">where it's gonna be
if it's not for us.</font>

299
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:36,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Jeff.
I went there.</font>

300
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You drove me there.
Miss Daisy's in the house,</font>

301
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">thanks for the ride,
sorry about slavery.</font>

302
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't oversell
your clout, Alan.</font>

303
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're partner
because I sold you to Ted.</font>

304
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ted respects me...
- Ted's gone.</font>

305
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:50,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got too old, couldn't swim
with the sharks, and got eaten.</font>

306
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:52,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes no sense.
He started the firm.</font>

307
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't lose your own firm.
- You can if you're dead.</font>

308
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:56,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">That shark thing
was not a metaphor.</font>

309
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the big dog now.</font>

310
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you want
the last three years</font>

311
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this toilet to have a point?</font>

312
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:05,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'm the guy
you got to make happy.</font>

313
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, you know, you could
finish up your big win here.</font>

314
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Court is in session.</font>

315
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:13,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blind Justice presiding...
aah! Oh, my God!</font>

316
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!
Oh, one more recess.</font>

317
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:19,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit the corner
right on a fresh tattoo.</font>

318
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well boys and girls...</font>

319
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:27,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you brought
your popsicles,</font>

320
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's about
to get scalding hot</font>

321
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the sun chamber.</font>

322
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already know the rules...</font>

323
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:41,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there aren't any!</font>

324
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez, Dennis, are you on coke?</font>

325
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that crap off
and sit down.</font>

326
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:50,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that.
Of course there are rules.</font>

327
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two men are sealed
in the chamber,</font>

328
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">each with a broken unit.</font>

329
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">The heat will increase
until one man yields...</font>

330
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">or dies.</font>

331
00:13:57,518 --> 00:14:00,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begin!</font>

332
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:13,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just in time
for Jeff's closing statements.</font>

333
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:15,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?
Everything is terrible.</font>

334
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:18,205
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, no. Have you been
watching Dance Moms again?</i></font>

335
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking of dyeing my hair.</font>

336
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evil Abed, what are you doing?</font>

337
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to cut off
Jeff Winger's arm.</font>

338
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't let you.
That's horrible.</font>

339
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:29,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you mean dark?
Welcome to my world.</font>

340
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:38,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst! Jeff! Winger!</font>

341
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, this is a...
a terrible situation</font>

342
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">for me to have put you in.</font>

343
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guy like Alan isn't above
making trouble for you</font>

344
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">at your old firm.
- Shirley, I...</font>

345
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not worth your career.</font>

346
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to have
what you want.</font>

347
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:58,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, Shirley.
- Settle down.</font>

348
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Jeffrey, let's have
your closing statement.</font>

349
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your honor...</font>

350
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:37,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no closing statement,
because I'm throwing the case.</font>

351
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, it's okay.</font>

352
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:40,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine, don't worry.</font>

353
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">My client, Shirley Bennett,
my friend of three years,</font>

354
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">she told me that it was okay.</font>

355
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:48,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said what I want
was more important.</font>

356
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right, right?</font>

357
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, guys like me,</font>

358
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll tell you
there's no right or wrong.</font>

359
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:57,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no real truth.</font>

360
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you.</font>

361
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:02,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you
just like I killed him.</font>

362
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as long as
we all believe that,</font>

363
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">guys like me can never lose.</font>

364
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that out loud?</font>

365
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the truth is...</font>

366
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:14,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lying when I say
there is no truth.</font>

367
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:18,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is...
the pathetically, stupidly,</font>

368
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:22,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">inconveniently obvious
truth is...</font>

369
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:27,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helping only ourselves is bad,
and helping each other is good.</font>

370
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:30,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I just wanted
to get out of here,</font>

371
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">pass biology,
and be a lawyer again</font>

372
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of helping Shirley.</font>

373
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was bad.</font>

374
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:36,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my former colleague</font>

375
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:40,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">wanted so badly
to keep his rich client</font>

376
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he just asked me
to roll over</font>

377
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">in exchange for my old job.</font>

378
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess we all walked
in here pretty bad.</font>

379
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:51,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now...</font>

380
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's gone good.</font>

381
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's helping me.</font>

382
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that easy.</font>

383
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just stop thinking
about what's good for you,</font>

384
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">and start thinking about
what's good for someone else.</font>

385
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:14,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can change
the whole game</font>

386
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">with one move.</font>

387
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you like this idea,
you can make it true</font>

388
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:27,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">by doing something good
for everyone here.</font>

389
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw this case out of court.
It's dumb.</font>

390
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is all.</font>

391
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I withdraw my case.</font>

392
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you just do some</font>

393
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">inspirational speech
about friendship?</font>

394
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fired.</font>

395
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go, soft serve.
You're finished.</font>

396
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:53,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, never got a chance
to tell you this,</font>

397
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was me who turned you
in to the state bar.</font>

398
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

399
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I never got
a chance to thank you.</font>

400
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place has made you so gay.</font>

401
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:05,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Don't use "gay"
as a derogatory term.</font>

402
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:06,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Booyah, good person.</font>

403
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, take this man</font>

404
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:13,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the infinite labyrinth
of eternal ice.</font>

405
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- No!</font>

406
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, take him to the police.</font>

407
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">He murdered someone.
Take him to jail.</font>

408
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are weird.</font>

409
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:25,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, that was great.</font>

410
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were like
a white Blair Underwood.</font>

411
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
if you're willing, I think</font>

412
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">we should let Jeff sign
the sandwich shop form.</font>

413
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you could represent
both of us.</font>

414
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, like our attorney.</font>

415
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:35,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, Pierce!
You had your first good idea.</font>

416
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:38,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Britta, I'm so sorry.</font>

417
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter, Abed.</font>

418
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've never
played therapist with you.</font>

419
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:43,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll change my major
just one more time.</font>

420
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't.
You cured me.</font>

421
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm not cured.
I'm willing to admit</font>

422
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:47,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I definitely need therapy.</font>

423
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only kind
of shrink I could ever trust.</font>

424
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind with as little control
over my mind as me.</font>

425
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:55,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I cut in?</font>

426
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:58,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy!</font>

427
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're back.</font>

428
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:02,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I made a new rule</font>

429
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:03,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the air conditioning
repair school</font>

430
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">has to act like
a regular school.</font>

431
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do that
because I'm their messiah.</font>

432
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. I went crazy and
I wanted to cut off Jeff's arm.</font>

433
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed you so much, buddy.</font>

434
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Jeff,
we still best friends?</font>

435
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:25,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

436
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cellular mitosis.
