to a warehouse</font>

00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:06,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the middle of nowhere.</font>

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could at least tell us why.</font>

4
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:08,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I know as much as you.</font>

5
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:09,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a letter</font>

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the executor
of my father's estate.</font>

7
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:13,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">It said to come out here
with my seven closest friends.</font>

8
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought six.</font>

9
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who else
was he gonna bring?</font>

10
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Levar Burton was a maybe.</font>

11
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Hawthorne.</font>

12
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize.
Gilbert.</font>

13
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even from the grave,
my father's got you</font>

14
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the short and curly
salt and pepperies.</font>

15
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Gilbert Lawson.</font>

16
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was Cornelius Hawthorne's
assistant for over 30 years,</font>

17
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">and before that,
I was just the teenager</font>

18
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">who read the Bible to him
in the bath.</font>

19
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:34,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ew.
- All right, all right.</font>

20
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's inheritance time.</font>

21
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">How 'bout that check,
soul brother?</font>

22
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father did leave you
something,</font>

23
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's more of an activity.</font>

24
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for keeping it
as creepy as possible.</font>

25
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">This looks like a multi-player
gaming interface.</font>

26
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:45,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard enough.</font>

27
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,332

old fossil face.</font>

to invest in video games</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">back in 1979.</font>

00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius spent over 30 years
developing a video game for you.</font>

31
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was his dying wish</font>

32
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you and seven of your
closest friends would play it.</font>

33

<font color="#FFFFFF">Lavar Burton was a maybe.</font>

34
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, please, choose a seat.</font>

35
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

36
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a 100-year-old man designed
a 30-year-old video game?</font>

37
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,519

38
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you're seated
behind your computers,</font>

39
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">a photograph of you
will be taken</font>

40
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an avatar will be made
from your likeness.</font>

41
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't bring my likeness.</font>

42
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:18,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't smile.</font>

43
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,615

50
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:04,439

- Sex.</font>

63
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:30,199

Jeff, you just murdered Annie.</font>

68
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, better than
doing nothing!</font>

69

- That's debatable.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we engage,</font>

73
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">we should hang back and study
their tactics.</font>

74

- Group sex.</font>

75

00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool, I'm alive.</font>

77
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce?
- This game makes no sense.</font>

78
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,591

<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, point the joystick
right.</font>

80
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm supposed to
just guess that?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the instructions?</font>

82
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that! Take that!
Yeah, we rule!</font>

83
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:08,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys are alive.</font>

84
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You re-spawn in the study room
when you die.</font>

85
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,240

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hang back and study
their tactics"?</font>

88

<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him get it
out of his system.</font>

89
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:19,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, forget it.
Let's just keep moving.</font>

90
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what?</font>

91
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Hawkthorne.</font>

92
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's dad's voice.
Dad?</font>

93
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piercinald, in 1980,</font>

94
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">you said that video games,
not moist towelettes,</font>

95
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">were the business
of the future.</font>

96
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:45,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, moist towelettes are
stocked in every supermarket,</font>

97
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">while arcade after arcade
closes.</font>

98
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a point.</font>

99
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless,
I designed this game</font>

100
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be played upon my death</font>

101
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">by you and whatever
cabal of fruits,</font>

102
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">junkies, and sluts
you call your friends.</font>

103
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name is Britta.</font>

104
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one player can win...</font>

105
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first to reach my throne
inside Castle Hawkthorne.</font>

106
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their reward, Pierce,
will be your inheritance.</font>

107
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- His inheritance? What?</font>

108
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you see, Pierce,
turns out you were right.</font>

109
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Video games are important.</font>

110
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worst son ever!</font>

111
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, great.
How do I fight you guys?</font>

112
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which button fights?</font>

113
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, stop.
- Pierce, relax.</font>

114
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, stay in the game,
stay in the game.</font>

115
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, calm down.</font>

116
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nobody's gonna fight you.
- Why not?</font>

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when you're friends
with someone for three years,</font>

118
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's weird to steal
their family's money.</font>

119
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there wouldn't be
a lot of sport in beating you.</font>

120
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look at yourself.
- Yeah, he's right.</font>

121
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're playing the game wrong.</font>

122
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Harry Belafonte in here?</font>

123
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Gilbert.</font>

124
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supposed to
cooperate,</font>

125
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're supposed to compete.</font>

126
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the advice,</font>

127
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think we can choose
how we want to play.</font>

128
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I suppose we can.
- Is he being ominous?</font>

129
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:48,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you being ominous?</font>

130
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.
We can pick stuff up?</font>

131
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">This game is more complex
than you can imagine.</font>

132
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:55,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">And aside from its programmers,</font>

133
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:57,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">who have all been deported
back to China,</font>

134
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one who knows
how it works.</font>

135
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run, run!
He's gonna throw a knife!</font>

136
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna throw a knife!
Go!</font>

137
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:04,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jump! Jump!</font>

138
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:07,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wah!</font>

139
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! What are you...?</font>

140
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a psychopath!
He's suffo...</font>

141
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

142
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look, buddy,
I know it must have sucked</font>

143
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">being colonel Sanders'
manservant and all,</font>

144
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Pierce is technically
our friend,</font>

145
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're not gonna watch you
screw him over.</font>

146
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you should be
asking yourselves</font>

147
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">how you intend to stop me.</font>

148
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about if we come over
there and kick your ass?</font>

149
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get him, Troy.</font>

150
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be my guest.</font>

151
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">But 30 seconds after you
leave your chairs,</font>

00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">the weight sensors
will recognize it</font>

153
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:39,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an automatic forfeit.</font>

154
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weight sensors?</font>

155
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.
Let's get that jag!</font>

156
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:45,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Get him!</font>

157
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:49,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kick that hippie's ass!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

158
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!
Move, move, move!</font>

159
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think he left a note.
- What?</font>

160
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">"After you've squandered
the last of your savings,</font>

161
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:00,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'll watch you writhe,
penniless, in the gutter,</font>

162
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">"through a telescope
in the penthouse office</font>

163
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:02,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Hawthorne Tower."</font>

164
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can leave notes.
This game is incredible.</font>

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

166
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, Pierce!
- Please, no!</font>

167
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:11,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you!</font>

168
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let me die.</font>

169
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, so Gilbert
knows a couple tricks.</font>

170
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big deal.
We outnumber him.</font>

171
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:20,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">And most importantly,
while he's fighting for greed,</font>

172
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're fighting for friendship,</font>

173
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means we can't lose,
okay?</font>

174
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay!</font>

175
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess there's no hug button.</font>

176
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody
keep Pierce protected.</font>

177
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get him to the Throne
of Hawkthorne before Gilbert.</font>

178
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't forget, when you die,</font>

179
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:43,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go all the way back
to the study room.</font>

180
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... Don't die.</font>

181
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good pep talk, Jeff.</font>

182
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:49,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I used to love dying,</font>

183
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:50,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that speech really
turned me around.</font>

184
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:52,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.</font>

185
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?
Kill it!</font>

186
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a girl milking a cow,
Pierce.</font>

187
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll check it out.
I owe Jeff that.</font>

188
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't gonna say it.</font>

189
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Hilda.
I live in the village.</font>

190
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:05,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lesbian.
- Shh!</font>

191
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can help with that.</font>

192
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have information
on many topics.</font>

193
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

194
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">The throne is in Castle
Hawkthorne, north of here.</font>

195
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:20,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You unlock the castle with the
white crystal of discipline,</font>

196
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">which you must free
from the black caverns.</font>

197
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm picking up on
some hidden symbolism.</font>

198
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:25,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right,
"white crystal."</font>

199
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think dad was into meth?</font>

200
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can usually get supplies
in a town like this.</font>

201
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:30,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, why can't my mom be here?</font>

202
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">She always said my video game
knowledge would come in handy.</font>

203
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never believed her.</font>

204
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody split up
and take a hut.</font>

205
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:40,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our only chance of beating
Gilbert is to cover more ground.</font>

206
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have information
on the following topics.</font>

207
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:48,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.</font>

208
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have you been
my whole life?</font>

209
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I buy and sell weapons
and armor.</font>

210
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. We need weapons.</font>

211
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Well, what's free?</font>

212
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we have a torch?</font>

213
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thief! Thief!
- Annie, put it back.</font>

214
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:06,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

215
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arr! Arr!</font>

216
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, sorry, sorry.</font>

217
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:09,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- Oh, oh! Oh, no!</font>

218
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- It was an accident!</font>

219
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:12,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Arrr!
- He's dying!</font>

220
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Arrrrrr!
- All right, hold on, hold on!</font>

221
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrr! Arrr!</font>

222
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what are you doing?</font>

223
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was suffering!</font>

224
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, from axe wounds!</font>

225
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if this isn't
worth any points, what is?</font>

226
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're asking me? I'm still
looking for a pong paddle.</font>

227
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:30,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's play poker.
- Oh, now we're talking.</font>

228
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:32,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check the desk.
I'll check the dresser.</font>

229
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:33,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I straighten
that painting?</font>

230
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't.
Stop playing like a girl.</font>

231
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop playing like a girl?</font>

232
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:41,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing
about women, Jeff.</font>

233
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't hack and slash
our way through life</font>

234
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're one with life.</font>

235
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help me hide the body.
- Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord.</font>

236
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, these things happen
in video games.</font>

237
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They do?
- Yes.</font>

238
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:55,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't get hung up
on real world morality.</font>

239
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:56,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to survive and win.</font>

240
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:59,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, I'm the blacksmith's
wife... Aah! Help!</font>

241
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, crap!
- Guard the door.</font>

242
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

243
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:03,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley!</font>

244
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">No witnesses!</font>

245
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:06,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab everything you can carry.</font>

246
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll check upstairs
for any more family.</font>

247
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't give me that look.
These are your loose ends.</font>

248
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just tying 'em up.</font>

249
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so cool.</font>

250
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are your clothes?</font>

251
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce taught me poker.
I'm not good at it.</font>

252
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:18,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still talking to this girl?</font>

253
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she only has three moves</font>

254
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you activate with basic
patterns of stimulus.</font>

255
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never felt this way
before.</font>

256
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, don't get weird.
- Oh, I won't.</font>

257
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not ready
for anything serious,</font>

258
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:27,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she wants me
to meet her family.</font>

259
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:30,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father is the blacksmith.
- Her father's a blacksmith.</font>

260
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello!
- Everybody go shopping?</font>

261
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all we did.</font>

262
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that hut on fire?</font>

263
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my.
What an unexplained tragedy.</font>

264
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't we look comfy
at a cauldron.</font>

265
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:43,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out.</font>

266
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, see, I'll put
all of this in here,</font>

267
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then that,
and then I'll hit this.</font>

268
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

269
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume, like,
a strength potion.</font>

270
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I assume it's poison.</font>

271
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:55,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just jealous
because we found a world</font>

272
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I know what I'm doing.</font>

273
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place is 20 cat turds
and a pixies poster</font>

274
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">from being your apartment.</font>

275
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with
the St. Pauli girl?</font>

276
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hilda's parents lived there.
Now she has no family.</font>

277
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be forced to marry
a male villager</font>

278
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">or take her chances
in the wilderness.</font>

279
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of game is this?</font>

280
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, crap, it's Gilbert.
- Well, well, well.</font>

281
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:17,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone's
one step behind.</font>

282
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if you're looking
for equipment, tough luck.</font>

283
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">The store was lost
in a freak accident.</font>

284
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hardly need equipment,
young lady.</font>

285
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:27,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you were shopping, I
gained enough levels to do this.</font>

286
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:28,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh,
come on and bring it!</font>

287
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's shooting lightning
and I'm naked!</font>

288
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get behind us!
We have armor!</font>

289
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Whoa!</font>

290
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:35,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

291
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great! Gilbert!</font>

292
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great!
Evil Jedi lightning Gilbert!</font>

293
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

294
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:45,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, drink that super
strength potion you made.</font>

295
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:46,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right, right, right, right.</font>

296
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:47,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up, Britta!</font>

297
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying, I'm trying!
Aah!</font>

298
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:51,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, I thought we could
count on Britta</font>

299
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">to not screw up drinking.</font>

300
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:54,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">This'll be fun.</font>

301
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:58,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

302
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's hoping we can
count on her</font>

303
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">to screw up making potions.</font>

304
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

305
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff bet all our lives
on Britta and won,</font>

306
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:16,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I lost my pants
to a pair of nines.</font>

307
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

308
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's play.</font>

309
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:37,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are you sure about this?</font>

310
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It just feels like
the right thing to do.</font>

311
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I made it back.</font>

312
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys never died.
How did you beat Gilbert?</font>

313
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know.
Teamwork.</font>

314
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:47,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were headed
for the black caves</font>

315
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find the white crystal.</font>

316
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just saying goodbye
to Abed.</font>

317
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stay here
in the village with Hilda</font>

318
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">and help her rebuild her life.</font>

319
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, she's a program.</font>

320
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have said
similar things about me.</font>

321
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh. He's playing
the rain man card.</font>

322
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:58,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's bounce.</font>

323
00:11:58,027 --> 00:11:59,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got an inheritance to win.</font>

324
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offensive.
Called it.</font>

325
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:07,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Britta.</font>

326
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:13,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did great in there, Jeff.</font>

327
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Pierce.</font>

328
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, duck.
Stay ducked.</font>

329
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, unduck.</font>

330
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:25,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now jump.</font>

331
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're almost there.</font>

332
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.
This cave is the worst.</font>

333
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I don't know
what's more offensive...</font>

334
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:32,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">the actual racism
or the insulting notion</font>

335
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:34,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it might somehow
rub off on us.</font>

336
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out! Jive turkeys!</font>

337
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:38,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill them before
they start multiplying!</font>

338
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:43,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, suck on this!
- Take that, jive turkey!</font>

339
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:51,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!
The white crystal!</font>

340
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:52,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo!
- Yeah!</font>

341
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:53,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get it!
- Get it!</font>

342
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:54,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take it.</font>

343
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've earned it
by having friends.</font>

344
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it.</font>

345
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:03,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It certainly is.</font>

346
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, man!
- You again?</font>

347
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:05,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'll have that crystal.</font>

348
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you'll have this.</font>

349
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font>

350
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrows!</font>

351
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:13,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Come on!</font>

352
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:16,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you get all that stuff?</font>

353
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:18,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've only been alive
for an hour.</font>

354
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:24,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was not fair.</font>

355
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, Gilbert?</font>

356
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're cheating, which I
have no problem with,</font>

357
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're getting caught,
and that's not cool!</font>

358
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:31,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, don't be a knob.</font>

359
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">That inheritance
is rightfully mine!</font>

360
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rightfully?</font>

361
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:36,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his son.</font>

362
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:40,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So am I.
- Oh.</font>

363
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:44,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
That can't be true.</font>

364
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:47,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're half... white.
- Nice save.</font>

365
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:49,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember
your childhood nanny, Etta?</font>

366
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Etta had a hot cousin.</font>

367
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother.</font>

368
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:57,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you see, Pierce,</font>

369
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your half-brother,</font>

370
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:02,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am more your father's son
than you ever were,</font>

371
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:05,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">so shut up and play the game.</font>

372
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why you...
- Let's go, Pierce.</font>

373
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:12,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look,
I know things seem hopeless</font>

374
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he's all the way to
the castle with the crystal</font>

375
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:15,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're starting over,</font>

376
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">but here's the thing...</font>

377
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're better at this game now.</font>

378
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've died and been reborn,
and that makes us heroes.</font>

379
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:23,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Charge!
- Let's get him!</font>

380
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the fact that
we're still playing</font>

381
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">means he hasn't won yet.</font>

382
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but what's the point?</font>

383
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll just keep cheating
until he wins.</font>

384
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are all the trees cut down?</font>

385
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:57,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't this where
Abed's village was?</font>

386
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, old friends.
- Abed!</font>

387
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember Hilda.</font>

388
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live in the village.
I love Abed.</font>

389
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she just say your name?</font>

390
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:05,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if you max out
a character's trust</font>

391
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">and affection levels,
you can gain access</font>

392
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:08,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a front-end
scripting language.</font>

393
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch.</font>

394
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool cool cool!</font>

395
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:14,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can make babies for me.</font>

396
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:15,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and I can't?</font>

397
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

398
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:18,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on inside.</font>

399
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:19,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I built this from scratch.</font>

400
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:20,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check out my castle.</font>

401
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:21,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, it's nice.
- Wow.</font>

402
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:22,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope this isn't blood gold.</font>

403
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my family.</font>

404
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby Abed has my eyes
and her bonnet.</font>

405
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:27,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each baby is capable of
executing custom code,</font>

406
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:29,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means you can
write a code</font>

407
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">that makes one baby
tell another baby what to do,</font>

408
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">much like real children
on a playground.</font>

409
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed, but...</font>

410
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, let's find
the tin man's heart later.</font>

411
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, how much stuff
do you have here</font>

412
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:38,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what can we make with it?</font>

413
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That depends.
- On?</font>

414
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">On what you can imagine.</font>

415
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, cool, cool.</font>

416
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome,</font>

417
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:52,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are the first to make it
to the Throne of Hawkthorne.</font>

418
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me take a look at you.</font>

419
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to your complexion,</font>

420
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:00,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you might be
Gilbert Lawson.</font>

421
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this true?</font>

422
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:03,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a moment.</font>

423
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Gilbert.</font>

424
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Due to the nature
of our relationship,</font>

425
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need your
electronic signature</font>

426
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:10,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">on this legally-binding
agreement.</font>

427
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:13,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">It dictates that you
will never, ever</font>

428
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">besmirch the Hawthorne name
with any outlandish notions</font>

429
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">regarding you
genealogical origins.</font>

430
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:23,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the bastard offspring
of a colored seductress</font>

431
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an unknown,
weak-willed miscegenist...</font>

432
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:36,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a simple question,
Gilbert.</font>

433
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you agree?</font>

434
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:44,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for being honest,
Gilbert.</font>

435
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

436
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your son!</font>

437
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Gilbert.</font>

438
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always knew
you'd disappoint me.</font>

439
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool cool cool!
Cool cool cool!</font>

440
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:58,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I see
you've chosen teamwork.</font>

441
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:00,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">A coward's strategy.</font>

442
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will upgrade your challenge
accordingly.</font>

443
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:13,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bequeath my fortune
to no inferiors.</font>

444
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Attack!</font>

445
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this now?</font>

446
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
Here we go!</font>

447
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!
Aim for the joints!</font>

448
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool cool cool!
Cool cool cool!</font>

449
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take that!
- Get him!</font>

450
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die, racism!</font>

451
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:33,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed shooting lava ♪</font>

452
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

453
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that!</font>

454
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:44,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- Aah! Oh, no! Aah!</font>

455
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Look at me now, dad!</font>

456
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

457
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:08,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose
you're wondering, player,</font>

458
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:12,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">why record myself
breathing weird</font>

459
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">and letting you destroy me.</font>

460
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I am a man of honor.</font>

461
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you've earned
the pleasure of my death.</font>

462
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I didn't.</font>

463
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the one that beat you.</font>

464
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are.</font>

465
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:33,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're forfeiting.</font>

466
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Warning.
Player forfeit in 30.</font>

467
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilbert, you're right.</font>

468
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:39,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were more his son than me.</font>

469
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took all his crap</font>

470
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you didn't even
get to take his name.</font>

471
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">He once sat on me in church
just so he could see better.</font>

472
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've only been playing
this game a couple of hours.</font>

473
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:52,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been playing it
your whole life,</font>

474
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:55,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now it's time
for your reward, brother.</font>

475
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:58,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">So get in there
and kill our dad.</font>

476
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:01,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Pierce.</font>

477
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:04,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second.
Here, take this.</font>

478
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Whoa!</font>

479
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You may need it.
- Oh, Pierce.</font>

480
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really don't know how
this works, do you?</font>

481
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you always carrying that?</font>

482
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in the shower.</font>

483
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:25,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to thank you again
for today</font>

484
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">and offer my apologies
for my conduct.</font>

485
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:29,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't myself.</font>

486
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family can make a person
do a lot of crazy things.</font>

487
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand. I have an uncle
who makes his own pizza.</font>

488
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:37,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, totally.</font>

489
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it would make it up
to any of you in any way,</font>

490
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a bar in town
called Skeepers,</font>

491
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I hear they make
a specialty drink...</font>

492
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Margarita, in fact,
and it's served in a glass</font>

493
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:48,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">an entire yard long.</font>

494
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My treat.
- Score.</font>

495
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:52,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the greatest day
of my life.</font>

496
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted
to have a brother.</font>

497
00:19:54,674 --> 00:19:57,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, settle a bet.</font>

498
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:01,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">The word "mulatto,"
is it okay or just borderline?</font>

499
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:04,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We apologize for him.
- Oh, that's okay. He's family.</font>

500
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hilda, my love, I said
I'd come back for you.</font>

501
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think that
in a parallel universe,</font>

502
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Blorgons are...
- Hold on.</font>

503
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">A baby.
I wasn't expecting this.</font>

504
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we'll have to support it.</font>

505
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I could get
some kind of job,</font>

506
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:36,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe at Beans and More.</font>

507
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll probably have to work
double shifts, but...</font>

508
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, I see.</font>

509
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you're off, climbing
the ladder at Beans and More,</font>

510
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just stay home
and raise him alone.</font>

511
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fine. I'll just
give up on my dreams.</font>

512
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here we go.
- What?</font>

513
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to learn
a strong man can cry.</font>

514
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what were you saying
about Blorgons?</font>

515
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blorgons...
in this other universe,</font>

516
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're actually called
Glorbons.</font>
