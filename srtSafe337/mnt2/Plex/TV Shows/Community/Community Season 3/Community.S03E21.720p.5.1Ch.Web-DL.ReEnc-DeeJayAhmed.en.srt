It's not the real Dean.</font>

that way, it sounds ridiculous.</font>

00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't this a felony?</font>

24
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:55,857

25
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:58,109

the Dean on campus,</font>

76
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's no way we're

81

<font color="#FFFFFF">But the fact is,
wherever there is air,</font>

82
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:33,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have eyes.</font>

83
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,398

84
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suffice it to say,</font>

85
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Chang were holding
your Dean captive,</font>

86
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">it'd be pretty foolish
to hold him on campus.</font>

87
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'd be even more foolish to
hold him in a central air room</font>

88
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the cafeteria,
which we monitor.</font>

89

<font color="#FFFFFF">You win the bet.</font>

91
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's
in the cafeteria building?</font>

92
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose he is.
In the basement.</font>

93
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And suppose you wanted
to get to him.</font>

94
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose you actually managed
to make it</font>

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">past the guards at the front,</font>

96
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's 50 more inside,
armed to the teeth</font>

97
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">with stun batons
and misplaced sexual aggression.</font>

98
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say you happen
to get past them</font>

99
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then you get to meet
Chang's number one,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Joshua,</font>

101
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:16,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">a 4'10", 105-pound bucket
of piss and zit cream.</font>

102
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot express to you how much
I hate this kid.</font>

103
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:22,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, beyond that dog sneeze
in a pair of reeboks,</font>

104
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna find
a state-of-the-art</font>

105
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">keypad on the basement door.</font>

106
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just for extra fun,
they change the code every day,</font>

107
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only copy is locked up
in Chang's office.</font>

108
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, just for a lark,
let's pretend</font>

109
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">you actually make it down
to the basement door.</font>

110
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is there to greet you?</font>

111
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another guard and another lock</font>

112

<font color="#FFFFFF">to which there is only one key.</font>

113
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:45,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where is that key?</font>

114
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well where is it?</font>

115
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry,
it's very clear in my head.</font>

116
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Key's around Chang's neck.</font>

117
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:57,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, you're not getting
down there without our help.</font>

118
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">So help us.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Just you and probably Obama.</font>

123
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it some thought.</font>

124
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:18,452

<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it works
best with a cobra,</font>

a length of garden hose...</font>

132

that if we get caught</font>

133
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">on that campus, we go to jail?</font>

as sarcastic as I am</font>

135
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">would last in prison?</font>

136
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:37,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a long time.</font>

137
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,807

a practical way to do this.</font>

they'll help us.</font>

140

<font color="#FFFFFF">We could walk in and out.</font>

141
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll mean I'll have
to move out of here</font>

142
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:48,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and into AC school housing,</font>

143
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I won't be able to hang out
with you guys anymore,</font>

144

Or anything, ever.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be so dramatic, Troy.
The answer is simple.</font>

149

00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the works
"accidentally" go off</font>

300
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I hit the final note
on my awesome keytar solo,</font>

301
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll burn up
the school's records</font>

302
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all evidence of my misdeeds.</font>

303
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,493
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Chang, you're insane.
You're still into keytar?</i></font>

304
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to tell the board
what you did!</font>

305
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:46,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going
to tell the board what you...</font>

306
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think they'll believe</font>

307
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Greendale Seven
and the worst Dean ever</font>

308
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">over the guy who just nailed
an awesome solo?</font>

309
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to burn down
the school and kill everyone!</font>

310
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:56,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire can't go through doors,
stupid.</font>

311
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a ghost.</font>

312
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:03,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this is a bit
of a long shot,</font>

313
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:06,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't suppose any of you
paid my rent?</font>

314
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:09,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, everyone,
for joining in my celebration.</font>

315
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:13,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">As many of you know,
I ate my twin sister in utero.</font>

316
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:16,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">So on my birthday,
I try to remember</font>

317
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a winner.</font>

318
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's for you, Connie.</font>

319
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:29,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a-one, a-two,
a Chang, Chang, Chang-four.</font>

320
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all going to die.</font>

321
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get out of here.</font>

322
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

323
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a miracle.</font>

324
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

325
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:03,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Let's get out of here!</font>

326
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:04,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

327
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Troy, you didn't...</font>

328
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:10,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time.
We gotta go.</font>

329
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six guards, two on scooters.</font>

330
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang started his solo.</font>

331
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:25,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowing him,
that gives us only nine minutes</font>

332
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:26,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get to the records room.</font>

333
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:28,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need a distraction.</font>

334
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:31,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard the lady.
Take your tops off.</font>

335
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:32,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might have something.</font>

336
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:34,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">To supplement
Greendale's budget,</font>

337
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been renting the school out
for raves on the weekend.</font>

338
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:38,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call it "academania."</font>

339
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mostly hard house,
some... some dubstep,</font>

340
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:42,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but totally...
- Perfect.</font>

341
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed,
you make a run for it.</font>

342
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:46,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean,
I think it's time to party.</font>

343
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:49,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

344
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what the freak?</font>

345
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:53,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

346
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:55,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

347
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:58,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You weigh nothing!
- I can't see them.</font>

348
00:15:58,145 --> 00:16:03,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're too many of them.</font>

349
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oof.
- Baboof.</font>

350
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which wire do I cut?</font>

351
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one.</font>

352
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I hope I'm right.</font>

353
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study group!</font>

354
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:33,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it!
So we're done, right?</font>

355
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:36,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done?
Done? Done? Done?</font>

356
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not done.</font>

357
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You foiled me for the last time.</font>

358
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:49,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, it ends as it began.</font>

359
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't begin this way.</font>

360
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:53,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's going on
in here?</font>

361
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, fellas.</font>

362
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:57,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just caught
the Greendale Seven</font>

363
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to burn down the school.</font>

364
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a hero.
How about that cake?</font>

365
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying.
He kidnapped the Dean.</font>

366
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we gathered that much
when we found these two</font>

367
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">slap-fighting in the hallway.</font>

368
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:08,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole my life!</font>

369
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:12,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is hard out there
for a fake Moby!</font>

370
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:16,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl, Richie,
let me ex-Chang.</font>

371
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:22,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not getting paid, am I?</font>

372
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

373
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:27,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a madman
in a Napoleon costume</font>

374
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">ran the school into the ground
and almost blew it up?</font>

375
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
And on our watch.</font>

376
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to us?</font>

377
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have
a drinking problem.</font>

378
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:36,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to get fired.</font>

379
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:37,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a matter of time</font>

380
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:40,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">until everyone finds out
what happened here.</font>

381
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody can sit on something
this big.</font>

382
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:45,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll sit on it.</font>

383
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I became Dean,
I made a pledge</font>

384
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">to swallow
this school's failures</font>

385
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:55,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">and spit out degrees
because that's what deans do.</font>

386
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:56,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd do that for us?</font>

387
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

388
00:17:57,881 --> 00:17:59,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do it for Greendale.</font>

389
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:01,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.</font>

390
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:03,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's great to have you back,
Craig.</font>

391
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost as if you were
never unknowingly gone.</font>

392
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yard margs at Skeeper's.</font>

393
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:10,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.
I left my credit card there.</font>

394
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Craig.</font>

395
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys saved me.</font>

396
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:19,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
how I will ever repay you.</font>

397
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already have.</font>

398
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy,
you don't have to do this.</font>

399
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">The AC school has no claim
on your soul.</font>

400
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:32,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but I do.</font>

401
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man's only as good
as his word,</font>

402
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">or his nod through a camera
to a guy with a button.</font>

403
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.
Say your goodbyes.</font>

404
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, never change.</font>

405
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:53,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do, if you want,
I'm not your boss.</font>

406
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, honey.</font>

407
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never wear a rubber.</font>

408
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never listen to Pierce.</font>

409
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you finally finish
that Jigsaw puzzle...</font>

410
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:24,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you tell me what kind of
boat is at the end of that dock?</font>

411
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a lock of my hair.</font>

412
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creepy.</font>

413
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.</font>

414
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

415
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say to you?</font>

416
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:15,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, "I know you hate
when people do this in movies."</font>

417
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I got emotional.</font>

418
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy Barnes.</font>

419
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home.</font>

420
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:39,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really digging
this hard house!</font>

421
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite a groove.</font>

422
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my school!</font>

423
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called Greendale,</font>

424
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm the Dean
of the entire school.</font>

425
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I wasn't for a while,
but it's a long story.</font>

426
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:54,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, everybody,</font>

427
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">you should come by during
the day sometime.</font>

428
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:59,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's totally different.</font>

429
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, stop by.
It'll blow your minds.</font>

430
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can meet my best friend,
Jeffrey.</font>

431
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, I'll take a back rub.
Who's asking?</font>
