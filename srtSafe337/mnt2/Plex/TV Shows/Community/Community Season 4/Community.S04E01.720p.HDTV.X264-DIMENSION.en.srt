00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed back from summer.</font>

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.
Something's changed.</font>

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's 12 additional
thumb tacks on that board.</font>

4
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're driving me crazy.</font>

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.</font>

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool, but also not.</font>

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, have a good summer?</font>

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take them off.</font>

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy first day of school.</font>

10
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.
I brought brownies.</font>

12
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, it's me.</font>

14
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh, I see we've all reinvented
ourselves over the summer.</font>

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little late
to the hipster party much?</font>

16
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little much on the much much?</font>

17
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should get to class?
Where's Pierce?</font>

18
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- Hey-o!</font>

19
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I'm late.</font>

20
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn Mexican cleaning woman
did a cha-cha</font>

21
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">on my glasses,
so I got to wear this old pair.</font>

22
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.
Abed.</font>

23
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed.
- Yup.</font>

24
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you go to your happy place?</font>

25
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:09,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Did you envision</font>

26
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">a babbling brook
like I described?</font>

27
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I started out
with a babbling brook,</font>

28
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then I layered in elements
from our world.</font>

29
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure fans of the babbling
brook will complain,</font>

30
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:17,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I thought
that was limiting.</font>

31
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's best
to keep it simple.</font>

32
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was a babbling brook.
- Okay.</font>

33
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the deal, Jessica Biel.</font>

34
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:25,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first day of senior year
is emotional for everyone,</font>

35
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I hereby therapize you to go</font>

36
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">to your happy place
whenever you feel stressed.</font>

37
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I found my lucky notebook.
- Found my lucky charm.</font>

38
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:37,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you ready for our last
first day of school?</font>

39
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready, buddy?</font>

40
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:44,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need a minute.</font>

41
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:45,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ This is my show</font>

42
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,872

00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,040

00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,516

53
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe we're finally
getting into this class.</font>

54
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe there's a class</font>

55
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">called "The History
of Ice Cream."</font>

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seniors!</font>

57
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">There they are.</font>

58
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seniors!
- Oh, speaking of seniors,</font>

59
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided I'm going
to do senioritis this year.</font>

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, just hangin' out
and blowin' off classes,</font>

61
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">pullin' pranks,
not sayin' my "G's.</font>

62
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I'll pull
some pranks with you.</font>

63
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Or Jeff or whoever.</font>

64
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, whoever's around.
Whatever.</font>

65
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Abed, after class,
we're still doing</font>

66
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">our first-day-of-school
tradition, right?</font>

67
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it.</font>

68
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:51,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We like to make wishes
in the fountain.</font>

69
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:52,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ohh!
- Fellas, I hate to tell you,</font>

70
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:53,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">wishes aren't real.</font>

71
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want something bad,</font>

72
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to work for it.</font>

73
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or use a spell.</font>

74
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of our wishes come true.</font>

75
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year, Troy wished we got
Bin Laden and the Dorito Taco.</font>

76
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but Obama got credit
for both.</font>

77
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you wish for Jeff
to be on time for once?</font>

78
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No wasting wishes
on impossibilities.</font>

79
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to make
this year count,</font>

80
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially
since it's the last one.</font>

81
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, is all this
for "The History of Ice Cream"?</font>

82
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">They overbooked it, so it's
first come, first serve now.</font>

83
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just like real ice cream.</font>

84
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:23,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, over here!
- Oh, Jeffrey.</font>

85
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I can't believe
that you came early.</font>

86
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you read
Gary's twitter feed?</font>

87
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">He posted a crisis alert
about it.</font>

88
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came early to save seats.</font>

89
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know what, girls,</font>

90
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you the old flyer.</font>

91
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:40,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Instagram for besties"
is in room 44.</font>

92
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Showing up early,
helping others,</font>

93
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">sending girls away?</font>

94
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could this be
a whole new Jeff Winger?</font>

95
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ruin it by approving it.</font>

96
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:55,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so that's progressed.</font>

97
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's progressed,</font>

98
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it hasn't
progressed-progressed.</font>

99
00:03:58,737 --> 00:03:59,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's progressive.</font>

100
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good luck, Troy.
- Hey!</font>

101
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just walk in here!</font>

102
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been pissing in jars
for an hour</font>

103
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to keep this seat.</font>

104
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Too bad, Leonard.</font>

105
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right.</font>

106
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Simmer Dean.</font>

107
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.</font>

108
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:18,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale's registration
system has been hacked.</font>

109
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.
Someone hacked</font>

110
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">into the supply closet
and counterfeited</font>

111
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:25,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">these "History of Ice Cream"
admission cards.</font>

112
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever did this is very good.</font>

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is only one fair way
to solve this.</font>

114
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">So follow me to...</font>

115
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hunger Deans!</font>

116
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Thank you.</font>

117
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:06,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 35 tests of strength</font>

118
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:07,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">and agility.</font>

119
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:09,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">The winner of each one
of these contests</font>

120
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be awarded
a red rubber ball.</font>

121
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">No ball, no ice cream.</font>

122
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these are impossible
to counterfeit</font>

123
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:21,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">because each one has been marked
by my distinct bite print.</font>

124
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, lord, no.
- Yes.</font>

125
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we need
to take this class.</font>

126
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only History credit
this semester.</font>

127
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatevs.
We'll take it next semes.</font>

128
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ter.
Semester.</font>

129
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I need it now.</font>

130
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I took
some extra classes online,</font>

131
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm one history credit away
from graduating.</font>

132
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you're graduating early?</font>

133
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, graduating after 30
can't be characterized as early.</font>

134
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">When were you gonna tell us,
Jeff?</font>

135
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was working on a speech.</font>

136
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:48,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, believe me, it tied in
a lot of things.</font>

137
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a lot of resolutions
and epiphanies.</font>

138
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it would have gone down
a lot better</font>

139
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:55,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">after we had taken
the ice cream class together.</font>

140
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's why you were holding
our seats?</font>

141
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your own selfish reasons?</font>

142
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I want us
to take the class together.</font>

143
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:02,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want it to be
the last class we take together.</font>

144
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I probably should have phrased</font>

145
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that differently.
- Fine. Win your red ball.</font>

146
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I care?
I've got a senior prank to pull.</font>

147
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shirley.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

148
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Abed, ready
to make some wishes?</font>

149
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make chocolate hot dogs
a reality?</font>

150
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, why don't you go
with Britta?</font>

151
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'll just hang out here
and watch.</font>

152
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
Are you sure?</font>

153
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:20,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I'm fine.
- F-I-n-e or f-y-n-e?</font>

154
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">We made one of 'em a code
for "not fine."</font>

155
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- F-y-n-e.</font>

156
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, he's fine.
Let's go.</font>

157
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you around, old Jeff.
- No.</font>

158
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">New Jeff. New Jeff does not
just look out for himself.</font>

159
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">New Jeff is gonna win
seven red balls</font>

160
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he is not gonna take
that class</font>

161
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless you guys are with me.</font>

162
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're gonna have
to leave this place sometime.</font>

163
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like an ice cream cone melting</font>

164
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:46,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the sun, our time here
can't last forever.</font>

165
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was part of the speech
I was writing!</font>

166
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:51,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.
What's going on?</font>

167
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just making plans
for the future.</font>

168
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:57,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't stay
at Greendale forever.</font>

169
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:58,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is mine different
than yours?</font>

170
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out below.</font>

171
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming in for a land-Dean.</font>

172
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amelia Earhart?</font>

173
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:11,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close.
I am America's sexiest aviator,</font>

174
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leo DiCaprio.</font>

175
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, just as his character
lost his mind,</font>

176
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:19,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">so have I lost
your student records.</font>

177
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
I can't believe it.</font>

178
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Amelia Earhart
would have been faster.</font>

179
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:27,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know,
our student records are stored</font>

180
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a Microsoft Paint file,
which I was assured</font>

181
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">was future-proof.</font>

182
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile,
our extended warranty</font>

183
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not being honored
by the restaurant</font>

184
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">that used to be Circuit City.</font>

185
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think the fairest way
to handle this</font>

186
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to have everyone repeat
the last three years.</font>

187
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be serious.</font>

188
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">In-Dean, I am.</font>

189
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be here forever.</font>

190
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forever.
Forever. Forever.</font>

191
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stay in here forever.</font>

192
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:05,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen... and ladies.</font>

193
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">My first red ball</font>

194
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">is way up high.</font>

195
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">To touch my ball,</font>

196
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">first touch the sky.</font>

197
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

198
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up, Leonard.</font>

199
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna eat
your ice cream, Winger.</font>

200
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agh!
You? You're pre-med!</font>

201
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want ice cream.
- Yeah, well, I want</font>

202
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">to graduate with dignity.</font>

203
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not cool!</font>

204
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's really going
after that ball.</font>

205
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's got to be a joke
in there somewhere.</font>

206
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my first ball.</font>

207
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">New Jeff!</font>

208
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.</font>

209
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:45,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

210
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:49,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, if we're doing the
first three years over again,</font>

211
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:50,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could change majors.</font>

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always been curious
about Forensics.</font>

213
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, did you know
you could major in Antics?</font>

214
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked.
You need a tomfoolery pre-req,</font>

215
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they waive it for women.</font>

216
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is lunacy.</font>

217
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not gonna start over
as freshmen.</font>

218
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, there's
a freshman mixer tonight.</font>

219
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys freshmen?</font>

220
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can be.</font>

221
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">This prank is amazing.</font>

222
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna come in here later
and have the creepy feeling</font>

223
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone was in here.</font>

224
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go
before we get caught.</font>

225
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, aren't we gonna do
something now that we're here?</font>

226
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do something?</font>

227
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

228
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">A prank on a prank.</font>

229
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move everything
on his desk over an inch</font>

230
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">except his stapler.</font>

231
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he'll think
we moved his stapler.</font>

232
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, there's
so many levels to this.</font>

233
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about we fill his car
with popcorn?</font>

234
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds messy.</font>

235
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:52,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds messy!</font>

236
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, keys.
Keys.</font>

237
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm the Dean.</font>

238
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I come into my office,</font>

239
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">turn on the light.</font>

240
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, my, did my stapler
grow legs and move?"</font>

241
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:06,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then come over here for coffee.</font>

242
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would hide my keys</font>

243
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:14,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">in...
Huh.</font>

244
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

245
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heels.
Oh, you got skills.</font>

246
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

247
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look who got his ball.
- Not my ball.</font>

248
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:26,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ball.</font>

249
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted you guys
to see it.</font>

250
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- New Jeff.
- Jeffrey, is that blood on your shirt?</font>

251
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, it's cool.
It's Leonard's.</font>

252
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Oh.</font>

253
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two balls!</font>

254
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:40,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be so good
when I finally get it.</font>

255
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little weird
doing this without Abed.</font>

256
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
It'll be fun.</font>

257
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll put my...
my Britta twist on it.</font>

258
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got skills.
I got skills.</font>

259
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
Let's get this started.</font>

260
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">We always do
the first one together.</font>

261
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three.</font>

262
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wish for a great school year.
- I wish for 1,000 wishes.</font>

263
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great school year?</font>

264
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first wish
is always for 1,000 wishes.</font>

265
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have all these coins.</font>

266
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but the coins
aren't the wishes.</font>

267
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I didn't know that.</font>

268
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish for Britta to have 499
of my remaining wishes.</font>

269
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

270
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish to end all wars.</font>

271
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's another rule.</font>

272
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wishes
containing the word "all."</font>

273
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guaranteed ironic consequences.</font>

274
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
anyone's gonna miss wars.</font>

275
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Star Wars, Thumb Wars,</i></font>

276
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:26,333
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>wow, Storage Wars!</i></font>

277
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

278
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't get in the fountain.</font>

279
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm taking that penny back.
- I already told you,</font>

280
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">the pennies aren't wishes.</font>

281
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't flip a wish.</font>

282
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous.</font>

283
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your rules are ridiculous.</font>

284
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:38,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're Abed's rules.</font>

285
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're awesome,
and they always work.</font>

286
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Abed's not here, so...</font>

287
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unwish!</font>

288
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't do that.
- I just did.</font>

289
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unwish!
- No! Rewish.</font>

290
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ununwish.
- Give me it! Unwish!</font>

291
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

292
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!
Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

293
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... you're helping me!</font>

294
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:58,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're helping.
I like it.</font>

295
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:00,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unwish! Unwish!
- Oh, God!</font>

296
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does this feel good?</font>

297
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid, selfish Jeff</font>

298
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming here,
ruining our senior year.</font>

299
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, great!
My "G's are back.</font>

300
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it's crummy
that Jeff is leaving early,</font>

301
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're all graduating
eventually.</font>

302
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why the rush?</font>

303
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, so Jeff can run off
and be a gross lawyer again?</font>

304
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:17,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed
start drinking coffee?</font>

305
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:20,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I become
a boring hospital administrator?</font>

306
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to do that?</font>

307
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:22,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do. Right?</font>

308
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay, hospital administration!</font>

309
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't wait to be buried alive</font>

310
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">under a pile of paperwork
and bed pans,</font>

311
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">just trying to summon the
courage to ask out Dr. Patel,</font>

312
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gorgeous Indian neurosurgeon
who doesn't even know I exist.</font>

313
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a conversation,
is it?</font>

314
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:39,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo-hoo! The sad, slow march
toward death begins.</font>

315
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senioritis!</font>

316
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready, set...</font>

317
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Third ball.</font>

318
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fourth ball.</font>

319
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well.</font>

320
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone wants
to be a hero.</font>

321
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">A big man.
A huge, throbbing, sweaty...</font>

322
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I just want to get
my history credit</font>

323
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get out of here.</font>

324
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just need to know</font>

325
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">how bad you want it.</font>

326
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next competition
will be particularly difficult</font>

327
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:26,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">for some of you
because... It requires</font>

328
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">complete emotional commitment.</font>

329
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Tango.</font>

330
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be the judge.</font>

331
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">There can only be one winner,</font>

332
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">so choose your partners wisely.</font>

333
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Winger.</font>

334
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's water
under the bridge, right?</font>

335
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Partners?
- Sorry.</font>

336
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:38,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dance card's full.</font>

337
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my partner
in the Tango competition,</font>

338
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I choose...</font>

339
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dean.</font>

340
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fountain works.</font>

341
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these balls.</font>

342
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so close, I can taste it.</font>

343
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:08,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, only you could turn
a freshman mixer</font>

344
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a disaster.</font>

345
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was this close
to getting those two girls.</font>

346
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, look how close you're
holding your fingers together.</font>

347
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your penis.</font>

348
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, great news.</font>

349
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">After just one Forensics class,</font>

350
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found a way
to retrieve our student records.</font>

351
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">It turns out there's a backup.</font>

352
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's in this safe.</font>

353
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a theory, Dean.</font>

354
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do tell.</font>

355
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
you want me to graduate.</font>

356
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.</font>

357
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want success
for all Greendale students.</font>

358
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:44,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?
Then answer me this.</font>

359
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:46,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened
to the other History class?</font>

360
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">What other History class?</font>

361
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second History class,</font>

362
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one
that actually taught History,</font>

363
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">that disappeared
from the schedule</font>

364
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I took summer classes.</font>

365
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're telling yourself
a fantasy.</font>

366
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who really made those
counterfeited ice cream tickets?</font>

367
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:03,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's so good
that they got your handwriting</font>

368
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">with its hearts and flourishes?</font>

369
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:06,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, you're right.</font>

370
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you go, Jeffrey.</font>

371
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't supposed
to compete.</font>

372
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:11,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were supposed to walk away</font>

373
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the rest
of the study group.</font>

374
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:15,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't not get rid of me
that easily.</font>

375
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, why'd I make it
feats of strength and grace?</font>

376
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:22,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as if I wanted you to win.</font>

377
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that can't be true.</font>

378
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile.</font>

379
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best friends!</font>

380
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's hug it out.
Okay.</font>

381
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.
One more ball to go.</font>

382
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's another dance contest,</font>

383
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I think I got it.</font>

384
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with Abed?</font>

385
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no,
don't open the safe.</font>

386
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're redoing
our first three years.</font>

387
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's what I want.
- It's okay, Abed.</font>

388
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a trick I use
when I feel overwhelmed.</font>

389
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just imagine a happy place</font>

390
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then go there.</font>

397
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, what did you do
to Abed?</font>

398
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay balls!</font>

399
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,873

00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:38,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.</font>

401
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Abed. Is he
in his imagination emporium?</font>

402
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:44,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dreamatorium. No, this seems
like something new.</font>

403
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:48,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed was having some anxiety
about all the changes this year,</font>

404
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I may have told him to go
to a happy place in his mind.</font>

405
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:54,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told him to go somewhere
in his mind?</font>

406
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you realize
who you told that to?</font>

407
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last competition

409
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Jeff, you can go.</font>

410
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will think
you're selfish.</font>

411
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">This looks bad.</font>

412
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:07,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I hadn't broken Abed.</font>

413
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:10,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is one thing
we could try.</font>

414
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

415
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've only done this
once before.</font>

416

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, let's play Pretend.</font>

417
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we could be cowboys.</font>

418
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could be spacemen.</font>

419
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:31,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.</font>

420

<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not working.
- What's not working?</font>

421
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, contestants, final
competition begins right now.</font>

422
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:43,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I hate new Jeff.</font>

423
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys,
I have something to say.</font>

424
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!
Like always!</font>

425
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:49,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just outside Babyville.</font>

426
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:51,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing
outside Babyville.</font>

427
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, there is!</font>

428
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was scary,</font>

429
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">because change is always scary.</font>

430
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:59,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I thought of you guys,</font>

431
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wasn't so scared.</font>

432
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:03,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, when you brought
this group together,</font>

433
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:06,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">you changed our lives,
but then we changed each other.</font>

434
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're gonna keep changing
in unexpected ways.</font>

435
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're still gonna be
friends,</font>

436
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if we don't all become
professors at Greendale</font>

437
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:15,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">or open a restaurant together</font>

438
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">or move into the same apartment
building after Pierce dies.</font>

439
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if we go somewhere,</font>

440
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're not going anywhere.</font>

441
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:25,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

442
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a killer speech, Jeff.</font>

443
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- I didn't say anything.</font>

444
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:40,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I literally just walked up.</font>

445
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
I made the speech for you.</font>

446
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hit all the right notes.</font>

447
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to hang on to this
moment because I was so afraid</font>

448
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:47,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the future,
but then I realized</font>

449
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of this
was once the future.</font>

450
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was completely different
from what I'd known before.</font>

451
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was happening so fast,</font>

452
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in the end,
or in the now, I guess,</font>

453
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">it turned out great.</font>

454
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just like ice cream,</font>

455
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've melted together
and made a new...</font>

456
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had to run the scenario
to figure it out.</font>

457
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

458
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I missed the fountain.</font>

459
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:04,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

460
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:05,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta introduced a new rule...</font>

461
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">no rules.</font>

462
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:08,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
We can discuss it.</font>

463
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they were incepting,</font>

464
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:12,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got their balls.</font>

465
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now that we're out
of History of Ice Cream,</font>

466
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:20,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can finally take
"Advanced Claims Denial."</font>

467
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should take "Forensics."</font>

468
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:28,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can somebody tell me
what the hell we just did?</font>

469
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:31,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

470
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:32,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, wait.</font>

471
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:33,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, what are you...</font>

472
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! You smell like the floor
of a movie theater.</font>

473
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:36,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
but not for the usual reasons.</font>

474
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have had the worst day.</font>

475
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our dance photo
didn't come out,</font>

476
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:41,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone moved my stapler,</font>

477
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, worst of all, I hurt you.</font>

478
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:46,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll be happy to know</font>

479
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we'll be offering
another History class,</font>

480
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I care about you.</font>

481
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:51,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not because I found out
if we don't offer</font>

482
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">a real History class we'll lose,
like, $40,000 in grant money.</font>

483
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Dean.</font>

484
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, you didn't have
to come all this way</font>

485
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to tell me that.
- Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.</font>

486
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on my way.</font>

487
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please tell me
you're breaking into that condo.</font>

488
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:06,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I bought it.</font>

489
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we'll be
like almost roomies.</font>

490
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:11,587
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, good, you got wine.
I've got friends with benefits.</i></font>

491
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:12,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">No subtext.</font>

492
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why I was
so worried about change.</font>

493
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:16,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">This year's gonna be great.</font>

494
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:18,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right over.</font>

495
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:49,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure
this is gonna work?</font>

496
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guaranteed to work.
It's an antic.</font>

497
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:54,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!
Not so fast, you two.</font>

498
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get ready to run.
- In these heels?</font>

499
00:20:57,253 --> 00:21:00,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you girls
get those dresses?</font>

500
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're fabulous.</font>

501
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- They're charming.</font>

502
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

503
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so fast, mister.</font>

504
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:09,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse you?
- Excuse me. Thank you, sir.</font>

505
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not for you.
- Hello, it's Britta.</font>

506
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I know a man
when I see one.</font>

507
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, lord, no!</font>
