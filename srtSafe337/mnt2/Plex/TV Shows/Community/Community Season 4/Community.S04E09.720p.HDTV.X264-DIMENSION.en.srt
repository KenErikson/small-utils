<font color="#FFFFFF">Granted, Jeffrey looks amazing
when he broods,</font>

17
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

18
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:10,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't wanna talk about it,</font>

19
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't have to.</font>

20

<font color="#FFFFFF">They will talk <i>for</i> you.</font>

21
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you make, have,
and bring these?</font>

22
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- Don't answer.</font>

23
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's puppet therapy.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

24
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">The psychology world
has recently embraced it</font>

25
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">after seeing it on <i>Law & Order.</i></font>

26
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll notice that each puppet
is made in your likeness.</font>

27
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were a rush job.</font>

28
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:31,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like I had them

00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me just grab this thing
that's definitely not a whip.</font>

31
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">In addition to being adorable,</font>

32
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know firsthand
that puppet therapy</font>

33
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">can and does work.</font>

34
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Dean,
puppet Kevin here thinks</font>

35
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:44,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have a candy bar

36
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you know
how it winds you up.</font>

37
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:48,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
We'll split it.</font>

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Got money, bro?</font>

39
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not what he seems!</font>

40
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
Where's Pierce?</font>

41
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he's not with us,
but is he still with us?</font>

42
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:58,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure he's fine.</font>

43
00:01:58,884 --> 00:01:59,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, no one's seen him</font>

44
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">since he lost his mind
in the woods.</font>

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all were in the woods?
Oh.</font>

46
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so the puppets are working.
Okay.</font>

47
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

48
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:08,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did it start?
What happened?</font>

49
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:09,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not playing with puppets.</font>

50
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey.</font>

51
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:12,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, what happened
is between us and Jesus,</font>

52
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:14,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Jesus don't snitch.</font>

53
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:15,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I don't need
a puppet to express myself.</font>

54
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already say whatever I want.</font>

55
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I am a fan
of the medium, so...</font>

56
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">my father is withholding.</font>

57
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ow.
- Hm.</font>

58
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:23,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's interesting.</font>

59
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, are we just gonna avoid</font>

60
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">making eye contact forever?</font>

61
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are we, Jeff during sex?</font>

62
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

63
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just give it a shot
and move on.</font>

64
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

65
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're gonna play this game,</font>

66
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">then, unlike sex with Britta,</font>

67
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:36,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna do it quickly</font>

68
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">and with a small shred
of dignity.</font>

69
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eh.
- Yeah.</font>

70
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, dignity
is my middle name,</font>

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my first name is</font>

72
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:48,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean-nocchio!</font>

73
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:58,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo.
- It all started on Friday.</font>

74
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta was talking about a few
of her latest causes.</font>

75
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's for the Greendale
animal shelter,</font>

76
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">this one's for global warming,</font>

77
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:04,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">this one's for global cooling,</font>

78
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this one's
for the amount of rubber wasted</font>

79
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">while making stupid bracelets.</font>

80
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's called rubber flubbing,</font>

81
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:11,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's a real problem.</font>

82
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your eyes, people!</font>

83
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta said,
"Open your eyes, people."</font>

84
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Square.
- Nice.</font>

85
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you two doing?
- Oh.</font>

86
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're playing
"Study Group Bingo."</font>

87
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study group bingo?</font>

88
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been best friends
for four years,</font>

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we've fallen into a
comfortable, repetitive pattern</font>

90
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">like humorous misunderstandings
on <i>Three's Company</i></font>

91
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">or girls gossiping on
<i>Gossip Girl.</i></font>

92
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">So to liven things up,
Troy and I made this bingo chart</font>

93
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the predictable things
we say.</font>

94
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">This game is gay.</font>

95
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Square.
- You're mocking us?</font>

96
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a very Christian
thing to do.</font>

97
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:36,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Square.
- Oh.</font>

98
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:38,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we go back to studying now?</font>

99
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Square.
- I don't like this game.</font>

100
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:41,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me neither.
- I think it's mean.</font>

101
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's no point.
- Yeah, it's insulting.</font>

102
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, stop.
- Square.</font>

103
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed's right.</font>

104
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:49,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had the same conversation
a million times.</font>

105
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we're kind of stuck
in a—</font>

106
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rut?
- Yes.</font>

107
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:53,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to be fair,
there's not many things</font>

108
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:54,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could be stuck in.</font>

109
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Elevators.
- Bad marriages.</font>

110
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">A peat bog.</font>

111
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a flight in the middle seat.</font>

112
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Time loops.
- The bottom of a well.</font>

113
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your own emotions.
- Quicksand.</font>

114
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, stop!
- Square.</font>

115
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did we get so predictable?</font>

116
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here is our
state-of-the-art 1989 library</font>

117
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">where—oh, look!</font>

118
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is my favorite study group.</font>

119
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:14,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all really typify
the diversity</font>

120

<font color="#FFFFFF">we have here at Greendale.</font>

121

122
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,059

<font color="#FFFFFF">We're awesome.</font>

132
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is Greendale.</font>

133
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pulling our strings,
and we need a break.</font>

134
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:43,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, our Ferris Bueller
needs a day off.</font>

135

has a vintage Ferrari?</font>

is more of the same.</font>

you're on a runaway balloon?</font>

You could have died.</font>

let him die?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three!</font>

204
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:46,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, people.
I can't do this alone.</font>

205
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do it at all.</font>

206
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look.
A downstream.</font>

207
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce! No!</font>

208
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,672

209
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we fly to heaven,</font>

210
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">please don't tell my grandpa
about me and Britta.</font>

211
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not good.</font>

212
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are so many clouds.
It's so dark!</font>

213
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't even see
the Landing Strip</font>

214
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:12,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">or any of the other nudie bars.</font>

215
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, heaven, help us.</font>

216
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must be a mile
above the ground.</font>

217
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's international airspace.</font>

218
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're literally above the law.</font>

219
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff can marry any man
he wants.</font>

220
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second, guys.</font>

221
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're starting
to go down.</font>

222
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see?
Prayer works.</font>

223
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">So does gravity, Shirley.</font>

224
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know
who invented gravity, right?</font>

225
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Whoa!</font>

226
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:34,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, let's put a pin</font>

227
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the mysteries
of the universe convo</font>

228
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:36,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we land.</font>

229
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:38,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which will be sooner
than we thought.</font>

230
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:39,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gaining
speed fast, people.</font>

231
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Brace for impact.</font>

232
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:43,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, damn you, gravity!
- Damn you, prayer!</font>

233
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn you, Vicki!</font>

234
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone else noticed
Professor Duncan</font>

235
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">hasn't been around
for a long time?</font>

236
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I can soften our descent.</font>

237
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, no!</font>

238
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:01,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it to me strong,
old man monkey strength!</font>

239
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

240
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:09,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, obviously,
that was very scary.</font>

241
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:12,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Post-traumatic stress
is a real issue,</font>

242
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">but with these puppets
giving voice to our feelings,</font>

243
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can begin to heal.</font>

244
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come on.</font>

245
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be
a long and arduous process.</font>

246
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more.</font>

247
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:23,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, well, excuse Dean</font>

248
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">for reacting to the natural lull
in your story.</font>

249
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

250
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:32,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you hurt, I hurt.</font>

251
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:33,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened next?</font>

252
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

253
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We made it.
- Everyone okay?</font>

254
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm alive.
- Square.</font>

255
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, knock it off.
- Okay, still alive?</font>

256
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:41,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're all safe.</font>

257
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just have to figure out</font>

258
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to get back to Greendale.</font>

259
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're in the middle
of the woods.</font>

260
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:48,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do we start?</font>

261
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to split
into two groups,</font>

262
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">the survivors and the others.</font>

263
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the manifest?</font>

264
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, stop it
with your <i>Lost</i> references.</font>

265
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get back home.</font>

266
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:56,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we're stuck here?</font>

267
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to start
a prison system.</font>

268
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:59,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be stranded here forever,</font>

269
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:00,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've never seen
blue man group!</font>

270
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys,
we're gonna make it outta here.</font>

271
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta relax.
We're all gonna be fine.</font>

272
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

273
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

274
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to say,
if we're gonna die,</font>

275
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you guys.</font>

276
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you all too.
- I did see blue man group.</font>

277
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't get it.</font>

278
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't they talk?
They have so much in common.</font>

279
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Others!</font>

280
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:21,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

281
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

283
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:26,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean
to startle anybody.</font>

284
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought my hair
looked fake.</font>

285
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:32,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys are a long,
long way from Greendale.</font>

286
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know
we're from Greendale?</font>

287
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, from Pierce's shirt.</font>

288
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:37,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know
my name is Pierce?</font>

289
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:39,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's embroidered
on your Greendale shirt</font>

290
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got at the student store.</font>

291
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you know I got it
at the student store?</font>

292
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm a touch psychic.
- Oh! Huh. Hm.</font>

293
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I used to go
to Greendale just like you guys</font>

294
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:49,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I came out here
to be free.</font>

295
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:52,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is
how Greendale graduates end up:</font>

296
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">As transient mountain men.</font>

297
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.
Not as bad as I thought.</font>

298
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't you miss
having stuff?</font>

299
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out here,
you have everything you need.</font>

300
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can be
whoever you wanna be.</font>

301
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:04,942

00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys.</font>

453
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I've never slept
with the great Eartha Kitt ♪</font>

454
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:07,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ We dry humped inside
of her tour bus ♪</font>

455
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:10,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ This secret
inside me ♪</font>

456
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:13,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ was trapped beyond a doubt ♪</font>

457
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:20,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ and now my most
terrible secret's out ♪</font>

458
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna thank you all
for being so open,</font>

459
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">and honest, and for syncing
your mouth and hand movements.</font>

460
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now,
for my most terrible secret.</font>

461
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not what you would
call traditionally—</font>

462
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:38,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Abed,
you never told us your secret.</font>

463
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- That's right.</font>

464
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't share one that night.</font>

465
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we got back
from the woods,</font>

466
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone was being silent
and not making eye contact.</font>

467
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:46,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know why,
so I mirrored your behavior.</font>

468
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

469
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:49,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

470
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:50,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jeff,</font>

471
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't think you're
anything like your father.</font>

472
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:54,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
how you take care of one kid,</font>

473
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:55,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">let alone three.</font>

474
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:58,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw.
That's nice.</font>

475
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:01,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">So nobody thinks
I'm a slutty cheater?</font>

476
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

477
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or me as a criminal?
- No.</font>

478
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody respects me any less
as a political activist, right?</font>

479
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh...</font>

480
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">the level
to which we respect you</font>

481
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a political activist
has definitely not changed.</font>

482
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

483
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's how I would say it.
- Exactly.</font>

484
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:23,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whew.
Bye, Dean.</font>

485
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dean.</font>

486
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowledge is a party.</font>

487
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once again,
I help fix everyone's problems</font>

488
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">only to go home alone.</font>

489
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who says you have to be alone?</font>

490
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

491
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay—excuse me.
What are we doing here?</font>

492
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

493
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Gollum, no!</font>

494
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we ready?
Gonna take it from—from—</font>

495
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it from your line, Chevy.</font>

496

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

498
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:13,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!
Oh, it's happening.</font>

499
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dance, Shirley.
Dance, girl.</font>

Did he knock it off?</font>
