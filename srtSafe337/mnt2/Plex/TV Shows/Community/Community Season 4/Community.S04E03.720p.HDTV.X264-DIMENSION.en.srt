1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take that, blorgon.</font>

2
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good show, Inspector.</font>

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:13,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow, there are
50 years of these, huh?</font>

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, isn't it great?</font>

5
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:18,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can go anywhere
and any time in the universe.</font>

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it will probably be London
during the Blitz.</font>

7
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:23,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think I finally got
Abed to agree to let you come</font>

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the Inspector Spacetime Convention.</font>

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay.</font>

10
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you watching <i>Inspector Spacetime?</i></font>

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does he have to wake up so early?</font>

12
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we just tell Abed
that we're sleeping together?</font>

13
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No. Abed's fragile.</font>

14
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:36,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to ease him into it, okay?</font>

15
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:39,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we want him to freak out
and then we have to rescue him</font>

16
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:41,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">from some fantasy world where
submarines are small enough</font>

17
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">to enter the bloodstream?</font>

18
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I totally want to do that.</font>

19
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to go over
the convention schedule again.</font>

20
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:48,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go, go, go.</font>

21
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a minute.</font>

22
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, it's a week away,</font>

23
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:52,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we need to revise
our whole strategy.</font>

24
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:54,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mwah.</font>

25
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy.</font>

26
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:59,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've printed out several maps
of the convention center</font>

27
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">and color-coded
the best potential routes.</font>

28
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we know I have a longer stride,</font>

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm assuming
your superior physical fitness</font>

30
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">will allow you to compensate
with greater speed.</font>

31
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">One thing's for sure, though.</font>

32
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to save time by changing
into our costumes in the car.</font>

33
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Curling iron.
- Thanks.</font>

34
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming.</font>

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Abed.</font>

36
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just here for my breakfast date
with Troy.</font>

37
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good morning, Britta.</font>

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen you in over 12 hours.</font>

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

40
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you two are having sex.</font>

41
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've known for weeks.
- What?</font>

42
00:01:44,283 --> 00:01:46,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you say something?</font>

43
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love doughnuts.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

50
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:04,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">For an Inspector Spacetime convention,</font>

51
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would need a bag to put over my head.</font>

52
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Annie and I are going skiing.</font>

53
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:10,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the only reason
I agreed to this road trip.</font>

54
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

55
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always come early to save my seat.</font>

56
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's this about a road trip?</font>

57
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Pierce,</font>

58
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">no one was trying to leave you out.</font>

59
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just assumed
you wouldn't be interested.</font>

60
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:23,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why we left you out.</font>

61
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:24,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not fair.</font>

62
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't I go to
a Captain Warptime Convention?</font>

63
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:28,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you'll ruin it.</font>

64
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting sick of everyone assuming</font>

65
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I have nothing to offer.</font>

66
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, in Ancient Greece,
it was considered</font>

67
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:38,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">an honor to invite a person
my age to a space convention?</font>

68
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't invite Shirley either.</font>

69
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's better then.</font>

70
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:42,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

71
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,086

72
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

73
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe itâ€”
our first Inspecticon.</font>

74
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

75
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now are you sure
it's okay Britta's here?</font>

76
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she can just wait in the car.</font>

77
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool. Now the first
thing we need to do</font>

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">is find the booth
where they take the gluon photo.</font>

79
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a photo where two people
are fused together</font>

80
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the Inspector and Reggie were
bonded for eternity in episode 704.</font>

81
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:08,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

82
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, was there a female inspector?</font>

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And everyone hates her.
Not because they're sexist.</font>

84
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because she sucks.
- Well, I think it's cool.</font>

85
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta.
- Annie.</font>

86
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on your own, Al Capone.</font>

87
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.</font>

88
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I the only one freaked out by that?</font>

89
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I think Abed was just showing
that he's accepting of our relationship.</font>

90
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, really.
What was it?</font>

91
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Annie, sad news.</font>

92
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:46,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">They closed the ski slopes.</font>

93
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:48,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dozen scouts got buried
in an avalanche.</font>

94
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:49,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sad.</font>

95
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we cut our losses and head home.</font>

96
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:52,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Why? We're already here.</font>

97
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:54,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can still have fun
hanging out at the convention.</font>

98
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have more fun
hanging out with the parents</font>

99
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:57,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">that are circling the block.</font>

100
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, why are people staring at you?</font>

101
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they've never seen
a man who's had sex before?</font>

102
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:03,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, how many of those
do you have in your chamber?</font>

103
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough for the whole ride home.</font>

104
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

105
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- We wanted it to be a surprise.</font>

106
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bear a striking resemblance</font>

107
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">to <i>Inspector Spacetime's</i>
<i>Supervillain Thoraxis.</i></font>

108
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:20,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Now we're definitely leaving.</font>

109
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've never been
on an adult vacation before.</font>

110
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:25,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first time I've stayed in a
hotel without a number in its name.</font>

111
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:26,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you can stay if you want.</font>

112
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
I'll be in my room.</font>

113
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
The reservation's under my name.</font>

114
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:30,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy the nerds.</font>

115
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will enjoy the...</font>

116
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff won.
- I know.</font>

117
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, the gluon photo line
looks really long.</font>

118
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should probably get in it now.</font>

119
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:42,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely.
Right after I find Toby.</font>

120
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:43,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Toby?</font>

121
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toby Weeks.</font>

122
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arguably the biggest <i>Inspector</i>
<i>Spacetime</i> fan in the world.</font>

123
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been emailing for months.</font>

124
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
You never mentioned him.</font>

125
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:53,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you've been
so busy lately having sex.</font>

126
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:54,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, we talked
about embracing change,</font>

127
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:56,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm expanding my social circle.</font>

128
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope he makes it.</font>

129
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">He works in Nigeria in banking.</font>

130
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">He almost couldn't come because
all his money was tied up</font>

131
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this financial thing,
but I sent him 700 pounds</font>

132
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a plane ticket,
so he should be here.</font>

133
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed.</font>

134
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

135
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Abed.</font>

136
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:12,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector.
Ooh, before I forget,</font>

137
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:16,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">here is your check.
Thanking you very much indeed.</font>

138
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice.
- You wouldn't believe</font>

139
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:18,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">how many people
I emailed asking for help,</font>

140
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:19,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they completely ignored me.</font>

141
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.
Toby, this is Britta.</font>

142
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fraulein.
- And my best friend Troy.</font>

143
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where's your constable?</font>

144
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:28,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my best friend Andrew.</font>

145
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was supposed to come, but then his wife
wouldn't let him go at the last minute.</font>

146
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's such a...
Minerva.</font>

147
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, oh, Minerva.</font>

148
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:36,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a bitch.</font>

149
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, was that the female inspector?</font>

150
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,524

225
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,570

<font color="#FFFFFF">Normally we don't concern
ourselves with adultery,</font>

298
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I had to bring you down here.</font>

299
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe it.
He told me he was leaving.</font>

300
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:04,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say your catchphrase.</font>

301
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather not.</font>

302
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on here?</font>

303
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly our marriage
isn't worth repairing?</font>

304
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

305
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:17,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo!
- Wait, Nigel is married?</font>

306
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so Thoraxis.</font>

307
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:25,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your American accent
isn't at all convincing.</font>

308
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">We come all this way,
and you just leave me alone</font>

309
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">without so much as sending
a text message?</font>

310
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:32,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sick of it, Jeff...</font>

311
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nigel Winger.</font>

312
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get two more of these, please?</font>

313
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:38,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

314
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">This day has turned crazy.</font>

315
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:45,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go upstairs,
towel off, and pray to God</font>

316
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:46,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I wake up in the middle of a final</font>

317
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:49,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a class I didn't know
I was enrolled in.</font>

318
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoo.</font>

319
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:03,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, honey.</font>

320
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went all psycho girlfriend
on Abed, didn't you?</font>

321
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:08,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
I screwed up.</font>

322
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Classsic Troy.</font>

323
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

324
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happens to the best of us.</font>

325
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you a present.</font>

326
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">A quantum spanner.</font>

327
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it lights up</font>

328
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">or plays music or something.</font>

329
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta,</font>

330
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you agree to be bonded to me
forever in the gluon chamber</font>

331
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an expensive souvenir photograph?</font>

332
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

333
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:34,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

334
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:35,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

335
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:38,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait.
We can visit</font>

336
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">the original <i>Spacetime</i> set.</font>

337
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've got a spare bedroom,
so you can stay as long as you like.</font>

338
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:43,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">That all sounds great.</font>

339
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't know if I could
just pick up and leave.</font>

340
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have a life here.
- For now.</font>

341
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

342
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:49,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's face it.</font>

343
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neurotypicals don't have
the same focus you or I have.</font>

344
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:53,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">They always get distracted...</font>

345
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">by marriage, kids,
competitive cooking shows.</font>

346
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like your best friend David.
- That's right.</font>

347
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:01,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was planning on coming here even
though you were trapped in Nigeria?</font>

348
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:02,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I wouldn't say trapped.</font>

349
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you went to me and not to your
best friend and constable for help?</font>

350
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, his wife
probably deleted the email.</font>

351
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's a total...
Minerva.</font>

352
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

353
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're dressed
as the third Inspector,</font>

354
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">who was famous for trying
to strangle the actor</font>

355
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:14,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">who played Constable Dudley, because
they were both pursuing Linda McCartney.</font>

356
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">David doesn't actually exist, does he?</font>

357
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mad.</font>

358
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing you've said can prove that.
- Except that when we met you said</font>

359
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">- his name was Andrew.
- Bollocks.</font>

360
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- All right. Guilty as charged.</font>

361
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:28,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I had to be sure, didn't I?</font>

362
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you sent me that first email</font>

363
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">in which you figured out
that Inspector Spacetime</font>

364
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">is both his own grandfather
and grandmother,</font>

365
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew we were soul mates.</font>

366
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are special.</font>

367
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:39,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neurotypicals won't admit it,</font>

368
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:42,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">but some people are just better
than everybody else.</font>

369
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't handle it,
so they always leave.</font>

370
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like how the brilliant Inspector
has constant adventures,</font>

371
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:49,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">while his constables
always eventually return</font>

372
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">to their dull, ordinary earth lives.</font>

373
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:55,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe there's a reason the Inspector
always chooses a human companion.</font>

374
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an alien, but his human friends</font>

375
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep him grounded
and invested in the world,</font>

376
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">like with me and Troy.</font>

377
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could winger you for a second.</font>

378
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:03,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. I don't know
what that means, but...</font>

379
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:07,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe all relationships are
made up of logical inspectors</font>

380
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:10,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">and emotional constables,
and we need both</font>

381
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make space and time a better place.</font>

382
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're right.</font>

383
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.
Toby, Toby, Toby, no.</font>

384
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:22,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait just a second.</font>

385
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just playing a game.</font>

386
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to let me out.</font>

387
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not until
Stockholm syndrome sets in.</font>

388
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do you think
that'll be, a couple of hours?</font>

389
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you love me if I got you a churro?</font>

390
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:46,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.</font>

391
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I...</font>

392
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure how much air
there is in here!</font>

393
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">And still you talk.</font>

394
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy will find me.</font>

395
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:07,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- You know who Troy is.</font>

396
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Troy will find me.</font>

397
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:17,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything okay?</font>

398
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's fine.</font>

399
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is a gluon anyway?</font>

400
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we stop talking about Abed?</font>

401
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
I can't.</font>

402
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:28,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't feel right.</font>

403
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
I understand.</font>

404
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:32,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to him.</font>

405
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure?
- I've told you before.</font>

406
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about <i>Inspector Spacetime.</i></font>

407
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toby.</font>

408
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:52,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Abed?</font>

409
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:53,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's packing.</font>

410
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said you have a girlfriend
and don't need him anymore.</font>

411
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's coming with me to England.</font>

412
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're lying.
- How would you know?</font>

413
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:02,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Abed's my friend,</font>

414
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:03,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he would have told me.</font>

415
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he would have explained it
to me in very clear terms,</font>

416
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:09,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I get confused sometimes.</font>

417
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:10,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in there, isn't he?</font>

418
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

419
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Troy.
- Hey, Abed.</font>

420
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:17,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toby, have you ever been in a fight?</font>

421
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:19,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I have.</font>

422
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
He can make a fist.</font>

423
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would hurt harder than a slap.</font>

424
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in that one.</font>

425
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:26,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew that.</font>

426
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

427
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.
You know, for the first time</font>

428
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my long history
of being locked inside things,</font>

429
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew someone would come.</font>

430
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still want to take the gluon photo?</font>

431
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you think?
- Yes.</font>

432
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Cool.</font>

433
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:57,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just went upstairs
and saw your room.</font>

434
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saw the two robes, the two coffee cups,</font>

435
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">one with lipstick, one without.
And...</font>

436
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw actual hair
that looked a lot like mine</font>

437
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">on my side of the sink,</font>

438
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:08,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I have some questions.</font>

439
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, God.
- First one,</font>

440
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that actually my hair, and, if so,</font>

441
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:13,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">did it fall out naturally?</font>

442
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if it did,
you need to tell me right now,</font>

443
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I have to call science.</font>

444
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:19,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, what the hell is going on?</font>

445
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
I may have been play-acting</font>

446
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we were married, and then the staff</font>

447
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">thought you were cheating,
and I had to save face.</font>

448
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I have to worry about this?</font>

449
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was just daydreaming.</font>

450
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:34,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I've married you
at least a half a dozen times.</font>

451
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:36,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Troy.
And Zac Efron.</font>

452
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly Zac Efron.</font>

453
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does Zac get a drink thrown in his face?</font>

454
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I guess I was a little hurt</font>

455
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you ditched me.</font>

456
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we are friends, right?</font>

457
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it have been that painful
to hang out together?</font>

458
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:57,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can tell you one thing
your fantasy got wrong.</font>

459
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:59,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we were married, you wouldn't find me</font>

460
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">flirting with another woman
in a hotel bar.</font>

461
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:06,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are a lot of things
that you think are fun</font>

462
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:08,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I wouldn't want to do
because I'm...</font>

463
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Older?
- Not lame.</font>

464
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to hang out now?</font>

465
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I buy you a drink?
What do you want?</font>

466
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">An appletini.</font>

467
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:22,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, don't make me order that.</font>

468
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please?
- Please?</font>

469
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:31,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Appletini.</font>

470
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is so great.</font>

471
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have a surprise for you guys.</font>

472
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pow!</font>

473
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:40,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really pushing me here.
- He's back.</font>

474
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind if we crash this party?</font>

475
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we already crashed.</font>

476
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, Shirley,
I'm glad you guys made it.</font>

477
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:48,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was rude of me not to invite you.</font>

478
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Just remember, Abed,</font>

479
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did my best.</font>

480
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both did.</font>

481
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

482
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess we're taking off.</font>

483
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I'd like to stay
for a little while.</font>

484
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

485
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do that for me.</font>

486
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who says it's just for you?</font>

487
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:07,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, get your phones ready,</font>

488
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:09,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you are only
gonna see this once.</font>

489
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:20,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bow before Thoraxis.</font>

490
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:27,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, this is why I don't hang
with you folks on the weekends.</font>

491
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:40,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are, the 1960s,</font>

492
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:43,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">the greatest, grooviest period
in the entire history</font>

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the entire universe.</font>

494
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:50,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lucky.
I get to visit places like this</font>

495
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I can travel
through time and space,</font>

496
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not both at once.</font>

497
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why that is, Ensign?</font>

498
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, Inspector Spacetime,</font>

499
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:06,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">our minds would be blown
with the space/time confusion.</font>

500
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

501
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I must sleep
with the sexiest woman here,</font>

502
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">who is also my grandmother,</font>

503
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:15,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I will cease to exist.</font>

504
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know
I'm not your grandmother?</font>

505
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one way to find out.</font>

506
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you.</font>
