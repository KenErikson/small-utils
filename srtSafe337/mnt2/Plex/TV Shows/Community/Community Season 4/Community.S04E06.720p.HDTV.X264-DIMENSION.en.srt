<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, at some point,</font>

30
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang hit his head,
went un-crazy,</font>

31
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,194

00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">if hitting his head
was the original cause.</font>

36

in Kevin's recovery</font>

40

<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Abed, get
us in panning singles.</font>

147
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And can you say "powwow"
instead of "conversation"?</font>

148
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just sounds more you.</font>

149
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, action. Okay, you going to
make an entrance? Great.</font>

150
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it say?</font>

151
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:15,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says I have gullible friends
who will believe anybody,</font>

152
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I need
to make that anybody me.</font>

153
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">By exposing Chang
in front of the whole school.</font>

154
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Much like the
classic documentary</font>

155
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,137
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Capturing the Friedmans,</i></font>

156
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:26,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">my story just took a
completely unexpected turn.</font>

157
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:29,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, if you want this done right,
I'm going to need a steadicam for Garrett.</font>

158
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's showbiz.</font>

159
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,028
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We were all pretty
happy when Jeff came around.</i></font>

160
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">He became really gung-ho
about Abed's documentary,</font>

161
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and had a lot of great ideas</i></font>

162
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,372
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>about how to impress</i>
<i>the Macguffin people.</i></font>

163
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why Pierce</font>

164
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">should host the reception.</font>

165
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks their language.</font>

166
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, somebody's
making some sense.</font>

167
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a blackface
<i>senor</i> Wences bit</font>

168
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been workshopping.</font>

169
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

170
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, we need to find out</font>

171
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">what happened to Kevin before
he showed up at Greendale.</font>

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">What hellish experiences did he
overcome during those missing months?</font>

173
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:05,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you can use your forensic
knowhow to do some investigating?</font>

174
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Investigating?
Obvi.</font>

175
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help?</font>

176
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're willing to
learn, sure, partner.</font>

177
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Partner."
I like that.</font>

178
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going
to call you "Houlihan."</font>

179
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Partner" and "Houlihan."</font>

180
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:17,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

181
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">The postman found Kevin here.</font>

182
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:23,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was soaking wet
and smelled like fish.</font>

183
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's not a lot
to go on...</font>

184
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, it's almost
too much to go on.</font>

185
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:30,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Sullivan's trout farm
is just 1/4 mile away.</font>

186
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think you're
dealing with, Winger?</font>

187
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Houlihan.
Seems sort of thin.</font>

188
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">In an investigation, one dude always
has to go opposite the other dude.</font>

189
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how they
get things done.</font>

190
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:39,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you guys can work it out.</font>

191
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, we will.
- No, we won't.</font>

192
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, Shirley...
- Oh, that's me.</font>

193
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:46,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to take this camera</font>

194
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">and follow Chang around
for his day-to-day.</font>

195
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really get into the life of
a functioning Changnesiac.</font>

196
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:55,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to go
inside his home, work, pod.</font>

197
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:56,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get everything.</font>

198
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, that's great advertising
for my growing business.</font>

199
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'll do it. And with
my photography skills...</font>

200
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, thank you.</font>

201
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the dean told me
you were going to help me,</font>

202
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't believe it.</font>

203
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cool, smart lawyer
like yourself</font>

204
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">reaching out
to a little nobody like me?</font>

205
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never told you
I was a lawyer.</font>

206
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:15,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you didn't.</font>

207
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley said it, remember?</font>

208
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said,
"You hired Chang?"</font>

209
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:20,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said, "I'm
Kevin, and you are?"</font>

210
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you said,
"Not calling you Kevin,"</font>

211
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:22,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I said, "Hi, not calling you Kevin.
What are you having?"</font>

212
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you said,
"None of this."</font>

213
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Shirley said, "I don't
care what he calls himself.</font>

214
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He's a hard worker.</font>

215
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">"We're all broken people, and
we all deserve a second chance.</font>

216
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Like how I gave Andre
a second chance.</font>

217
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:32,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Doesn't mean I forgot.
I just forgave."</font>

218
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you said, "Chang didn't
sleep with a stripper.</font>

219
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:35,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He tried to kill us.</font>

220
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why does everyone keep
forgetting all that?"</font>

221
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Shirley said,
"But he didn't.</font>

222
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And you used
to be a sleazy lawyer."</font>

223
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:42,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her words.</font>

224
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. That's quite a
memory you have.</font>

225
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:47,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my short term memory
has actually improved.</font>

226
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:50,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">My doctor calls it a, um...</font>

227
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">side effect.</font>

228
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,738
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh.</i></font>

229
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well played, Chang.</font>

230
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chess match has begun.</font>

231
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...</font>

232
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Chinese?</font>

233
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to get some footage
while we're waiting for Kevin?</font>

234
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we could take some shots
of my delicious bread baking,</font>

235
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the affordable prices</font>

236
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:10,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">on our new Shirley's
sandwiches super saver menu.</font>

237
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we could get to know the
Shirley behind the sandwiches.</font>

238
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here, give me that camera.
- Oh. Okay.</font>

239
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful, now.
It's Abed's camera.</font>

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- Watch it.</font>

241
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, where is
the stop button on this?</font>

242
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here it is.
Okay.</font>

243
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You want to hear my pitch?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

244
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">A strong, independent woman,</font>

245
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting her own business.</font>

246
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">An "entrepreneu-her,"
if you will.</font>

247
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:33,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe a businesswoman?</font>

248
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:36,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine.
Think inside the box.</font>

249
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Are you ready?</font>

250
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm-hmm.
- Action.</font>

251
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut. Oh! Beautiful.</font>

252
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:45,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think
the song was too much?</font>

253
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?
It made the scene.</font>

254
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

255
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:50,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to get some better
lighting up in this noise.</font>

256
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go hit up Abed.</font>

257
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never told anybody
that story, Britta.</font>

258
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it was beautiful.</font>

259
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:57,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was dead for three minutes.</font>

260
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:58,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three minutes?</font>

261
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three whole minutes.
They thought I was gone.</font>

262
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:02,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.</font>

263
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:03,557

264
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:05,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Blackface <i>senor</i> Wences?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

265
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:07,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think it's coming?</font>

266
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,859
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In the unlikely event</i></font>

267
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,788

268
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty confident Pierce will
make sure we don't get a Grant.</font>

269
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you talkin' about, hookey?</font>

270
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:20,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that bit could not
get any more perfect.</font>

271
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,524

274
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong.</font>

275
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,915

- No, it's not.</font>

276

277
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.
It's too heavy!</font>

278
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:41,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett, now.</font>

279
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,865

280
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,470

Mr. Sullivan.</font>

281

I'm her partner, Partner.</font>

- No, you're not.</font>

283
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.</font>

284
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:55,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, the trout police?</font>

285
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:58,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if you are, you're legally bound
to tell me, or else it's entrapment.</font>

286
00:10:58,376 --> 00:10:59,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not the trout police.</font>

287
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen this man?</font>

288
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">One morning, I see something
coming out of the trout tank,</font>

289
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">and at first, I was scared,
because, uh, I'm the last face</font>

00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a lot of trout ever see.</font>

291
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:14,224

trout are a vengeful breed,</font>

292
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if they were, I...</font>

293
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd probably be public enemy number one.</font>

294
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the figure that emerged,
it was that man?</font>

295
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I was pretty relieved when
I found out it was a naked Asian guy,</font>

296
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:25,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not an angry trout.</font>

297
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when was this?</font>

298
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it must have been
around June.</font>

299
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember because
my milkweed allergies</font>

300
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">were acting up
something fierce.</font>

301
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:37,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave him some clothes, and sent
him on his way the next morning.</font>

302
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:38,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what happened
to him after that.</font>

303
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Sullivan, how many
employees do you have here?</font>

304
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Employees?</font>

305
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I look like,
trout world?</font>

306
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">No employees.
Heh, just me.</font>

307
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:49,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my dog.</font>

308
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,884
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I knew he was hiding something.</i></font>

309
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,504
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A spike in production in June,</i></font>

310
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the peak
of milkweed allergy season?</font>

311
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:59,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something on this trout farm was
starting to smell... wrong.</font>

312
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem was, I didn't have
any way to make him talk.</font>

313
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:04,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did I?</font>

314
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, looks like
everything checks out here.</font>

315
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:08,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Troy?</font>

316
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Houlihan, I don't think
anything checks out here.</font>

317
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't fly off the handle, Partner.</font>

318
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:16,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I will fly
off the handle, Houlihan.</font>

319
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you talking about?</font>

320
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
Mr. Sullivan.</font>

321
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, you have
nothing to hide.</font>

322
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you hiding?</font>

323
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:25,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine!</font>

324
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:26,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got me.</font>

325
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been using that Asian
guy as unpaid, manual labor</font>

326
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:32,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">for three months before
I drove him into town.</font>

327
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he wanted me to!</font>

328
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were friends,</font>

329
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:40,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I treated him
with respect and dignity.</font>

330
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Partner and Houlihan.</font>

331
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Kevin!</font>

332
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Partner and Houlihan.</font>

333
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

334
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he work for no money?</font>

335
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he doesn't know
about money.</font>

336
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kevin doesn't know about labor
laws, or 40-hour work weeks,</font>

337
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">or that that dude named him
after a dog.</font>

338
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:57,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Growing up,
I had a cat named Troy,</font>

339
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bird named Troy,
and a hamster named Troy.</font>

340
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were all older than me.</font>

341
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

342
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Kevin's struggle just
got a lot sexier, Grant-wise.</font>

343
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is horrible.</font>

344
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,716
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was horrible.</i></font>

345
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were supposed to
come back with a smoking gun,</font>

346
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:15,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all they found was a
little human rights abuse.</font>

347
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:17,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, normally, is terrible.</font>

348
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:18,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you believe Kevin now?</font>

349
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I want all your footage.</font>

350
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Chang slipped up.</font>

351
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not smart enough
to play dumb all the time.</font>

352
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about
Shirley and Britta's footage?</font>

353
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unusable crap.</font>

354
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.
I want it all.</font>

355
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:29,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want it bad enough
to rent me a crane?</font>

356
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe license
an expensive song?</font>

357
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, whatever.</font>

358
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,816
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ The itsy-bitsy spider</i></font>

359
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ went up the water spout</i></font>

360
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">unusable crap is generous.</font>

361
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:47,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes on like this
for another 12 hours.</font>

362
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't even get through it all,
and I sat through <i>The Tree of Life.</i></font>

363
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, right there.
What's that?</font>

364
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on,
you slippery snake, slip up.</font>

365
00:13:58,716 --> 00:13:59,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doubtful.
When he's alone,</font>

366
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:03,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">he mostly just practices smiling
and frowning. We've all done it.</font>

367
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:12,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's he calling?</font>

368
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good question.</font>

369
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">We figure that out,</font>

370
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've got our smoking gun.</font>

371
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all thanks to Britta.</font>

372
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ruin this.</font>

373
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,225
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The stage was set for
a climatic final set piece.</i></font>

374
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Macguffin people</i>
<i>were on campus,</i></font>

375
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,232

376
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shut up.</font>

377
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I love you.</font>

378
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get yourself in the kitchen,
and make me a burrito.</font>

379
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, yay!
Oh, thank you.</font>

380
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:39,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thank you,
Pierce Hawthorne</font>

381
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:42,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your special blend
of playful racial humor.</font>

382
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:45,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">And genuine thoughts
on Geraldine ferraro.</font>

383
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,235

384
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,283

Winger has a presentation.</font>

385
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:52,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yay.
- Ugh.</font>

386
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
I must confess,</font>

387
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:58,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just a short while
ago quite skeptical</font>

388
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">about Changnesia.</font>

389
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, with the help
of my friends,</font>

390
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have uncovered a lot
about this terrible,</font>

391
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">newly-discovered,
completely real disease.</font>

392
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you'll find it
as eye-opening as I did.</font>

393
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait till you see
what we found.</font>

394
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kevin was a victim
of human trafficking.</font>

395
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:17,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our purpose here tonight
is to help cure Kevin</font>

396
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">of his Changnesia.</font>

397
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who better to jog his memory</font>

398
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">than someone special from
his allegedly erased past.</font>

399
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:29,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">So please welcome to the stage
the former Mrs. Ben Chang, Alessandra.</font>

400
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,321

401
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:32,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

402
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben...</font>

403
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you remember me?</font>

404
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:44,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

405
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't.</font>

406
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:47,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Admit it, Kevin.</font>

407
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:49,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember her.</font>

408
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the woman
you never stopped loving.</font>

409
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:53,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit the lights!</font>

410
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:06,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

411
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love her so much,</font>

412
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:12,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">you called her over and
over and over again,</font>

413
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though you don't know her</font>

414
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">or how to use a phone
or what a number is.</font>

415
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on here?</font>

416
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me
I was here to help him.</font>

417
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we are here
to help him, all right.</font>

418
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:28,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are here to help him admit that he
has been faking this whole time.</font>

419
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you get
the number, Chang?</font>

420
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it in the vents!</font>

421
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 555-0190.</font>

422
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:38,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.</font>

423
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I always hung up,
because...</font>

424
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know if the
person on the other end</font>

425
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:46,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">would ever want
to talk to Kevin...</font>

426
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">after knowing Chang.</font>

427
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem so nice.</font>

428
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we were really married,</font>

429
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:55,297

one moment how lucky I was.</font>

430
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:56,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh...
- Aw...</font>

431
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Ben.</font>

432
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:00,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh!</font>

433
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:02,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, what are you doing?</font>

434
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if he doesn't remember her,
then this wouldn't bother him.</font>

435
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">My logic is flawless!</font>

436
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't that bother you?
That bothers you!</font>

437
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:13,087
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Things got so ugly,</i></font>

438
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,847
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hesitate to even</i>
<i>show you this footage.</i></font>

439
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I will let you see
me reacting to it.</font>

440
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll probably be

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm...</font>

442
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it's not that bad,
but this keeps the story moving.</font>

443
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:30,548

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!
Have you lost your mind?</font>

446
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never believed Kevin?</font>

447
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:39,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were just lying to manipulate
us into helping you hurt him?</font>

448
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I trusted you
and believed in you</font>

449
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fantasized about celebrating
over mimosas with you!</font>

00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, if this is the sort
of uphill battle</font>

451
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're facing in the fight
against Changnesia,</font>

452
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:51,223

all the help you can get.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But, on the bright side,</font>

458
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,215

461
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:17,508

463
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's funny.</font>

464
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,022

465

<font color="#FFFFFF">Which no one
seems to care about.</font>

467

<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I sit here?</font>

468
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you want
to be seen with me?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you.</font>

471
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever you are?</font>

474
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:48,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I get it.</font>

475
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Changnesia's hard
to understand.</font>

476
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least, that's what
people tell me.</font>

477
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know
a thing about it,</font>

478
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:58,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">which apparently is one of the symptoms,
and it's so frustrating.</font>

479
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:03,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know Chang
was a bad guy.</font>

480
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:07,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he probably deserved
everything you did to him.</font>

481
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not a bad guy.</font>

482
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:11,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just made a mistake.</font>

483
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm willing to start
over fresh if you are.</font>

484
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:18,548

it feels like to be Chang.</font>

488
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanting to leave
that name behind</font>

489

anyone can make.</font>
