<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, did you ever date
Roger Ebert?</font>

3
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- Nothing.</font>

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, did you ever
take pictures of your feet</font>

5
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:12,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">and post them on the Internet
for money?</font>

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sha-ha!
No.</font>

7
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this history final
is going to be killer.</font>

8
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to study.</font>

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's no fair
Professor Cornwallis</font>

10
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">turned all hard-assed again.</font>

11
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky Pierce.</font>

12
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Donating his kidney to Gilbert
to get out of it.</font>

13
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought
he'd be that generous.</font>

14
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although,
he did seem disappointed</font>

15
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the operation
didn't involve</font>

16
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">sleeping with a Russian woman,</font>

17
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:30,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">then waking up
in a bathtub full of ice.</font>

18
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:31,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Guys!</font>

19
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm?
- History!</font>

20
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am studying history.</font>

21
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:34,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm studying our history.</font>

22
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed!
- Nobody bite.</font>

23
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">We agreed no biting.</font>

24
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:39,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Jeff,
it's a graduation gift.</font>

25
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, on the surface we seem
like just a group of people</font>

26
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">from diverse backgrounds who
have become unlikely friends.</font>

27
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">But according to my research,</font>

28
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:46,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">our paths have crossed
many times.</font>

29
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were destined to meet.
Like a team of superheroes.</font>

30
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our origin story.</font>

31
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here... we... go.</font>

32
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:55,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we don't have
origin stories.</font>

33
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have lives.</font>

34
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least—</font>

35
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">yep, just me.</font>

36
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:03,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're saying
we're all connected</font>

37
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the classic
French film trilogy</font>

38
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,615
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Bleu, Blanc, Rouge?</i></font>

39
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, like something
more accessible.</font>

40
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like <i>Unbreakable.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i></font>

41
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I know
it's disappointing to you,</font>

42
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're not superheroes.</font>

43
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the real world,
not some comic book adventure.</font>

44
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done it.
I've infiltrated the school.</font>

45
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've learned its secrets.</font>

46
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gained everyone's trust.</font>

47
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, on the anniversary
of my empire's destruction,</font>

48
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">vengeance will be mine.</font>

49
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, vengeance will be ours.</font>

50
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, can you stop that?
It really creeps me out.</font>

51
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
Just really love this thing.</font>

96
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,358

doing that great in algebra,</font>

00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:32,276

if you need a tutor for math,</font>

98
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be happy to help.</font>

99

102
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

103
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, that's also a type of math.</font>

104
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we already knew
I went to high school with Troy,</font>

105
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's not like he even
remembered I existed.</font>

106
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,828

Here. Take this, for example.</font>

115
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a receipt I found</font>

117
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,395

for some comic book thing?</font>

118
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, my feet were cold.
Ah, here.</font>

119
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You should probably wash those.
- Oh.</font>

120
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Discovering the receipt
was dumb luck,</font>

121
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it proves
that we were at the mall</font>

122
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the exact same day.</font>

123
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,786

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the Love Hut?</font>

125
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Hmm?
No.</font>

126
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:21,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">So excited about tonight,
honey.</font>

127
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh. It's been too long</font>

128
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">since we had adult time
without the kids.</font>

129
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,699

00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,369

surprise for you too.</font>

131
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm in public, but, uh...</font>

132
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know you gonna get it,
right?</font>

133
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna get it!</font>

134
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,980

148
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,762

00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:20,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

152
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Now, I have time
to hit the seamstress.</font>

153
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess all I have to say
is "Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

154
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:33,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale Resort and Casino
presents Steve Winwood."</font>

155
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I just need to find
the one last smoking gun,</font>

156
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think this might be it.</font>

157
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it in a copy of
the Greendale communist worker.</font>

158
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:40,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look familiar?</font>

159
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

160
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is me and my anarchist
collective at the courthouse.</font>

161
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">We called ourselves
the An-her-chists.</font>

162
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you guys know
that Jeff's in that photo?</font>

163
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What!</font>

164
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff. My man.</font>

165
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congrats on getting
your case thrown out.</font>

166
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your argument
was a masterpiece.</font>

167
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
it was definitely creative.</font>

168
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creative?</font>

169
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">He convinced a judge
to forgive five years back taxes</font>

170
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">by getting him to agree</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ch-chk... Boom!</font>

175
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blew me away.</font>

176
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go!</font>

177
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

178
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for defending
a woman's right</font>

179
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">to use her body
however she chooses.</font>

180
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can honestly say that right
is very important to me.</font>

181
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw!</font>

182
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, Mr. Winger,
can we get a—</font>

183
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a hero.
Hi.</font>

184
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

185
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:28,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys!</font>

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have got
to capitalize on this momentum.</font>

187
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is time An-her-chists
finally takes a stand</font>

188
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">on animals rights.</font>

189
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a medical lab
in an office building nearby.</font>

190
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next week,
I say we break in there—</font>

191
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, we were thinking
this is our last hurrah.</font>

192
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this was our first hurrah.</font>

193
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're just getting going.
- Britta, we're done.</font>

194
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a hamburger
the other day,</font>

195
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">and suddenly I'm not cold
all the time.</font>

196
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:51,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Go.
I don't need you.</font>

197
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's an anarchist to do
without her organization?</font>

198
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, how could you?</font>

199
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was
a really good lawyer.</font>

200
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mysti is the stripper
that Andre cheated on me with,</font>

201
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you defended her.</font>

202
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I—</font>

203
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:08,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you hadn't gotten
that homewrecker off,</font>

204
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andre never would've met her.</font>

205
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff ends Shirley's marriage.</font>

206
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? I told you
we were always destined to meet.</font>

207
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

208
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually Jeff went to the same rec center,</font>

209
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I had no idea
their paths crossed again.</font>

210
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is good.
This is really great.</font>

211
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're really filling in
some plot holes here.</font>

212
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is good stuff.
It's really good.</font>

213
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I missed something?</font>

214
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">These aren't plot holes, Abed.
This is my life.</font>

215
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this kinda connection</font>

216
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">only makes our origin story
more compelling.</font>

217
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like how awesome it is</font>

218
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Uncle Ben is murdered
in <i>Spider-Man.</i></font>

219
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- My marriage almost ended.</font>

220
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:36,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for Jeff,</font>

221
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Jezebel
would've been in jail</font>

222
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of between
my Laura Ashley sheets.</font>

223
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, this is not my fault.</font>

224
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by the way,</font>

225
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">the case didn't work out
too great for me either.</font>

226
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was supposed to make
my career,</font>

227
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it put a target on my back.</font>

228
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:54,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michael Phelps, really?</font>

229
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:55,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it doesn't affect
his breathing?</font>

230
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

231
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mysti, can I talk to Jeff
for a moment?</font>

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will go, uh, powder my nose.</font>

233
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real.</font>

234
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

235
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's this rumor
going around the firm</font>

236
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you never received
an undergraduate degree.</font>

237
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's ridiculous.
- I know.</font>

238
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:16,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, some jag is obviously
jealous of your rising star.</font>

239
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the fact is,
until this is settled,</font>

240
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:20,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bar isn't gonna
let you practice.</font>

241
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you got caught
in your own lie?</font>

242
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost lost my family.</font>

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does your little tragedy
even compare?</font>

244
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I had to go
to school here.</font>

245
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:31,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, do not write that down.</font>

246
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like
I made Andre cheat.</font>

247
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I happen to think it's
cool that we're all connected,</font>

248
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if some of it's
in bad ways.</font>

249
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm finally willing
to forgive Annie</font>

250
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">for ruining high school.</font>

251
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I ruined <i>your</i> time
in high school?</font>

252
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:46,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you did.</font>

253
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys doing keg stands?
- Yeah!</font>

254
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can do a keg stand.</font>

255
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna do a keg flip.</font>

256
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everybody, look at this.</font>

257
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

258
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:03,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

259
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my football knee!
Why!</font>

260
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have some corn nuts?</font>

261
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:09,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wah!
No! Nooooo!</font>

262
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">That had nothing to do with me.</font>

263
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you already admitted
that you faked that injury</font>

264
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you couldn't
take the pressure</font>

265
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">of those football recruiters.</font>

266
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I faked my injury
because of what you said to me.</font>

267
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of what I said?</font>

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't even remember
that I went to school with you.</font>

269
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have lied about that too.</font>

270
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:32,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, it's time to do
senior class superlatives!</font>

271
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:38,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, the first award
is "Most Handsome."</font>

272
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:39,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the winner is...</font>

283
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this has to go to me,</font>

284
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:05,809

289
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy Barnes,
most likely to succeed?</font>

290
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:24,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the damn Valedictorian
and head of student council</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and president of campus
crusade for Christ.</font>

293
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:32,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are just
some mindless robot.</font>

294
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just go wherever
they tell you to run.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I had six different
reconstructive surgeries.</font>

302
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went through withdrawal.</font>

303
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to smile
when I didn't feel like smiling.</font>

304
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:06,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hurts my face.</font>

305
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we all just stop
dredging up the past?</font>

306
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing
your fate web thing does</font>

307
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">is point out how fragile
our happiness is.</font>

308
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:15,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only Jeff hadn't defended
that woman,</font>

309
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">if only Andre hadn't met her
after I left the restaurant,</font>

310
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">if only I didn't have to pick up
my kids at the mall, I—</font>

311
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

312
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:23,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">When? Which mall?</font>

313
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

314
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

315
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what movie
you guys gonna see?</font>

316
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,899
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Phantom Menace.</i>
<i>It's kind of old.</i></font>

317
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why
do you wanna see it?</font>

318
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we like <i>Star Wars.</i></font>

319
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if you like <i>Star Wars,</i></font>

320
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">why do you wanna murder it
and urinate on its grave?</font>

321
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:42,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prequels are terrible.</font>

322
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, seriously,
wouldn't Chewbacca,</font>

323
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">at some point, go,
"Hey, Yoda, I know that guy"?</font>

324
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:48,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has double light sabers.</font>

325
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's stupid.
You're both stupid.</font>

326
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why are you here
to see the movie?</font>

327
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not.</font>

328
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go wherever it plays
to warn people.</font>

329
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:56,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been warned.</font>

330
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:02,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stranger said what to him?</font>

331
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine.
I'll come get you.</font>

332
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, baby,
I'll be back as soon as I can.</font>

333
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:09,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, just stand there, okay?</font>

334
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be.</font>

335
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see why
I have to go to a therapist.</font>

336
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because after that woman
chewed them out for three hours,</font>

337
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">the theater got
a restraining order against you.</font>

338
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,662
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yalla.</i></font>

339
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, doc.
By the way,</font>

340
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:26,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone just stole
your prescription pad.</font>

341
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to liberate you!</font>

342
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

343
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the crazy man
at the mall!</font>

344
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who got me
busted for drugs!</font>

345
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:40,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were out there somewhere
and you weren't looking for me?</font>

346
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fairness, Annie,</font>

347
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">running through a glass door
might've been the drug tip-off.</font>

348
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this time,
I wondered what it was</font>

349
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">that brought our group
together.</font>

350
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I forgot one thing
all heroes need.</font>

351
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need an enemy.</font>

352
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman has the Joker,</font>

353
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Justice League
has the Legion of Doom,</font>

354
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this study group...
has me.</font>

355
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the supervillain.
Why didn't I see it before?</font>

356
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm emotionless, logical,
smarter than everybody else.</font>

357
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- I tried sawing off</font>

358
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff's arm.
- Why do you keep saying that?</font>

359
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go.
It's not safe to be around me.</font>

360
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just as bad.</font>

361
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't handle the monkey,</font>

362
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I traded it in
for a glaucoma brownie,</font>

363
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though I knew
if it bit someone,</font>

364
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would make them
a teensy bit psychotic.</font>

365
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's right.</font>

366
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all made
some bad decisions.</font>

367
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you really wanna know
who the villain is here,</font>

368
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's me.</font>

369
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah.
- Weee!</font>

370
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeesh, I didn't think
it was possible</font>

371
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">to put more glitter on.</font>

372
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's coming off of you
like Pig-Pen.</font>

373
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, some people
seem to like it.</font>

374
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">This married guy just gave me
his phone number.</font>

375
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe
his wife left him</font>

376
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">on their anniversary?</font>

377
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna call him?</font>

378
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he did just win
a bunch of money.</font>

379
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know though.</font>

380
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what?
You're not married.</font>

381
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta grab what you want
in this life.</font>

382
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the way it works.</font>

383
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:52,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone just took
something important from me.</font>

384
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what?</font>

385
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire him for it.</font>

386
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I mean,
I guess I'll go talk to him.</font>

387
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do that.</font>

388
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:00,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm gonna go get</font>

389
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">"crap on other people's lawns"
drunk.</font>

390
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">To a memorable evening
for both of us.</font>

391
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:10,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you coincidentally
affected some of us.</font>

392
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I actively endorsed pain.</font>

393
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the bad guy, and...</font>

394
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:19,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to think
I'm not that guy anymore.</font>

395
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, and I hate
to bring this up,</font>

396
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">you did once make me
pee myself.</font>

397
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess we're even then.</font>

398
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might finish studying
at home.</font>

399
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ten minutes ago,</font>

400
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would've been so excited
about that peeing thing.</font>

401
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to make a prequel
and I ruined everything.</font>

402
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it could happen to anyone.</font>

403
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should probably write
George Lucas a note of apology.</font>

404
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's not get crazy.</font>

405
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you didn't ruin anything.</font>

406
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I sit here?</font>

407
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
what are you doing here?</font>

408
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just wanted some yogurt.</font>

409
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I do know
you're not that person anymore.</font>

410
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?
'Cause I was awfully good at it.</font>

411
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we all do bad things
every now and again.</font>

412
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I put a stripper's head
through a jukebox.</font>

413
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

414
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing here?</font>

415
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we all
really wanted yogurt.</font>

416
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:33,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what's weird?</font>

417
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:35,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where I first decided
to go to Greendale.</font>

418
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, really?</font>

419
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:40,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where I was when I first
decided to go to Greendale.</font>

420
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kidding me.</font>

421
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:46,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senor Chang, I know you're
as disappointed as I am</font>

422
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the caliber of students
we have at Greendale.</font>

423
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the mall offers a whole new
valuable demographic</font>

424
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">of people awake
during the daytime.</font>

425
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll pass flyers
at Yogurtsburgh.</font>

426
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Self-serve yogurt.</font>

427
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those douses already know
one marketable skill.</font>

428
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Ben—</font>

429
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:02,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it still has the tags on!</font>

430
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I lost the receipt.</font>

431
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like I even got
to wear it,</font>

432
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">because my husband's
a tasteless man slut.</font>

433
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">What hey, littering!</font>

434
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">This better not
awaken anything in me.</font>

435
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, this day...</font>

436
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought pushing that woman's
head through a jukebox</font>

437
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">would make me feel better,
but I'm just...</font>

438
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of $54...</font>

439
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:34,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a marriage.</font>

440
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:37,066
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Crystal Skull</i> was aliens,</font>

441
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">so it's a pretty great film.</font>

442
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys seen this?</font>

443
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, working the program
with you has been so great.</font>

444
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:54,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I'm finally ready
to get my life back on track.</font>

445
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last chance.</font>

446
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just walk over there right now</font>

447
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">and apologize
to the theater manager.</font>

448
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Midichlorians.</font>

449
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Midichlorians!</font>

450
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:04,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

451
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:06,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're not going
to film school!</font>

452
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!
Do you have any vegan froyo?</font>

453
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you even know what froyo is?</font>

454
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Do you have
a job application?</font>

455
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

456
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">That weird guy
hasn't blinked once.</font>

457
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

458
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a dweeb.</font>

459
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what a dweeb.</font>

460
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice shot, man!</font>

461
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:31,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, do you work at Greendale?</font>

462
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work? That's putting it
charitably.</font>

463
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale community college
is a total joke.</font>

464
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:38,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd give a degree
to a monkey.</font>

465
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:42,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, does Ian Duncan still
teach psychology at Greendale?</font>

466
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That drunken limey?
- That's the one.</font>

467
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got tenure.</font>

468
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe getting my degree
won't be as hard as I thought.</font>

469
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, what are you doing?</font>

470
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get some help out here?</font>

471
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some old guy broke the machine
and is faking a heart attack.</font>

472
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait.</font>

473
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, stupid.</font>

474
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:14,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, cool, cool.</font>

475
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, so was that old guy
really Pierce?</font>

476
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll never know, because
he'll never ever remember.</font>

477
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are the chances
of all of us</font>

478
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">ending up at the same place
at the same time twice?</font>

479
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:26,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, it's amazing.</font>

480
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, yes,
2008 was the height</font>

481
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the slightly sour
frozen yogurt craze, but...</font>

482
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">that still doesn't explain it.</font>

483
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we really were
all meant to be together.</font>

484
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:40,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure I understand it,
but maybe we don't have to.</font>

485
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:43,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I do know is that
the ways our paths crossed,</font>

486
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:47,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">even when they were bad,
all led us to this point.</font>

487
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I wouldn't have it
any other way.</font>

488
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what you're saying</font>

489
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:53,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that we're all each other's
Uncle Ben's murder.</font>

490
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:55,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're all Spider-Men.</font>

491
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

492
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:58,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say I'm saying that.</font>

493
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:02,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, I think we know
whose will this really is.</font>

494
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I think I do.</font>

495
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:06,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

496
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

497
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed.</font>

498
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:21,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just doing
some Pilates.</font>

499
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was looking for you.
- Wha—I—</font>

500
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We discovered you're the
reason we all went to Greendale.</font>

501
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You linked all of our stories.</font>

502
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like how the Cosmic Cube
assembled the Avengers.</font>

503
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, and the 4-billion-dollar
deal with Disney.</font>

504
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out
you were always one of us.</font>

505
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:37,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I came to see if you wanted
to get some frozen yogurt.</font>

506
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

507
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's—</font>

508
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's all I ever wanted.</font>

509
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's too late.</font>

510
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:49,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's another thing
I realized.</font>

511
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of you we got to
reinvent ourselves at Greendale.</font>

512
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone should have the
same chance, don't you think...</font>

513
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chang?
- It's not Chang.</font>

514
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Kevin.</font>

515
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you known?</font>

516
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:05,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Known what?</font>

517
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:08,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only you know
who you really are.</font>

518
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, you may have
experimental monkey fever.</font>

519
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">You coming?</font>

520
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

521
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, can we stop
at the post office first?</font>

522
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something to mail
for the Dean.</font>

523
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's confidential
and I don't wanna talk about it,</font>

524
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">so stop interrogating me.</font>

525
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:33,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out.</font>

526
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too in to be out.</font>

527
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- Hi!</font>

528
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want some refills?
On me, huh?</font>

529
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Refills?
You want some?</font>

530
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time for plan "B".</font>
