1
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:05,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...
See you after the break.</font>

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:06,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you all doing
for Thanksgiving?</font>

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm having
Andre's whole family over,</font>

4
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">though he'll be stuck
working at the stereo store</font>

5
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Black Friday.</font>

6
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure, you get to say that,</font>

7
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're stuck
calling it "Jew Friday."</font>

8
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, I'll be with my family,
fielding the same old questions.</font>

9
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:19,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">"How's community college?"</font>

10
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:20,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What's your major?"</font>

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Are those real?"</font>

12
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:22,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">My aunt's boyfriend.</font>

13
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, my family's
a normal religion,</font>

14
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:26,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">"so I have to talk to them
for five minutes</font>

15
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I get a casserole
that's all marshmallow."</font>

16
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:30,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's you.</font>

17
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:31,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brainstorm.</font>

18
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you all
come over to my house?</font>

19
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have plenty of food.</font>

20
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That would be great.
- Marshmallows.</font>

21
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds good to me.</font>

22
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:37,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to microwave
buttered noodles,</font>

23
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this sounds
equally promising.</font>

24
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:39,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.
Oh, goody.</font>

25
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know,
you're all welcome, of course.</font>

26
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:43,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm in.
- Or, you know, Jeff or whoever.</font>

27
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't. Plans.</font>

28
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you change your mind,</font>

29
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't think of anyone
who would enjoy having you more.</font>

30
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">How-Dean, pilgrims.</font>

31
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that...
- John Wayne, yes.</font>

32
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:52,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good, you got it.</font>

33
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:56,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyhoo, I just thought
I'd mosey on over here,</font>

34
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">invite you all
to Greendale's annual</font>

35
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks-living
potluck dinner,</font>

36
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:04,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">where we remember all we have
to be thankful for.</font>

37
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">There may be a statistical link</font>

38
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:08,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">to enrollment at Greendale
and holiday suicide.</font>

39
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:10,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Just a shoelace...</font>

40
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">and belt-free night
full of fun.</font>

41
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should all drop by.</font>

42
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:15,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Jeff.
Or whoever.</font>

43
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:16,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he can't.
He has plans.</font>

44
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:18,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right,</font>

45
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are spending Thanksgiving
with your father.</font>

46
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I told you
to stop reading my email.</font>

47
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:25,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I thought I told
you to stop keeping secrets.</font>

48
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:26,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed to keep track</font>

49
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">of what you tell me
in confidence</font>

50
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:29,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what I hear
through your walls</font>

51
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a glass to my ear?</font>

52
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:36,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
Close your mouths.</font>

53
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm having Thanksgiving
with my estranged father.</font>

54
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:39,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we move on now?</font>

55
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:40,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes sense.</font>

56
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff's at a point in his life</font>

57
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">where he needs a strong
father figure to come out to.</font>

58
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, this is huge news.</font>

59
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huger news.</font>

60
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was this decision made after
our Halloween conversation?</font>

61
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:52,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, after.
Not because of.</font>

62
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take it.</font>

63
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had that teed up?</font>

64
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I say "thera,"
you say "pist."</font>

65
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thera...</font>

66
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:02,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">- pist.
- Thera...</font>

67
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:04,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the support, guys.</font>

68
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:07,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the support has just begun.</font>

69
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:09,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to bring
to papa Winger's house,</font>

70
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">some vegan pumpkin pie?</font>

71
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're not coming.</font>

72
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:15,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, regular pumpkin pie.</font>

73
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:16,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you're going to need me</font>

74
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">when things get messy
and emotional.</font>

75
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that's going
to get messy and emotional</font>

76
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">is Troy, when he realizes
there are yams</font>

77
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:22,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">underneath those marshmallows.</font>

78
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it was too good
to be true.</font>

79
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, speaking not just
as your friend</font>

80
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">but as an avid
daytime TV watcher,</font>

81
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">these parent-child reunions
can get intense.</font>

82
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chairs might be thrown.</font>

83
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weaves might be pulled.</font>

84
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:37,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or I could just go in there,</font>

85
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">show him how awesome I am,
no thanks to him,</font>

86
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">meet my half-brother...</font>

87
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, boom.
Closure.</font>

00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad has another son?</font>

89
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:47,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
So, clearly, he's moved on.</font>

90
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't I?
Close your mouths.</font>

91
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I appreciate
your concern,</font>

92
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">but really, the most helpful
thing you can do</font>

93
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">is stay out of my business.</font>

94
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, can you
say that last part again?</font>

95
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:58,257

are entirely too thick.</font>

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.</font>

- Hi.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's carve that jive turkey!</font>

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Got that out of your system?
- Yeah.</font>

110
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'm so happy
to welcome you all to my home.</font>

- Hello, come in.</font>

112
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your coats off.
Make yourself comfortable.</font>

00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or not.
No agenda.</font>

to pass some apps soon,</font>

of starvation to prove a point?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, everybody,</font>

119
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is Mr. Bennett,
my father-in-law.</font>

from college.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
That's Andre's people.</font>

122
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:20,805

124
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I brought something.
- Oh.</font>

125
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dip.</font>

126
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed, why is this
seven layer dip so puffy?</font>

127
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:30,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's been in the fridge
for two years.</font>

128
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was saving it
for a special occasion.</font>

129
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's so thoughtful.</font>

130
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:35,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to put this
on a nice platter</font>

in the trash.</font>

133
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff.
What's up?</font>

134
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up is closure.</font>

135
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:44,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met my dad,
we talked things out as men.</font>

136
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:45,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm ready to move on.</font>

137
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, in 20 minutes?</font>

138
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:51,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
Look, I couldn't do it.</font>

139
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was at the front door,
totally in control,</font>

140
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I started thinking
about all that stuff you said</font>

141
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:59,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">about messiness,
and it threw me off my game.</font>

142
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the irony is,</font>

143
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">after all your pestering that
I deal with my daddy issues,</font>

144
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're the reason
I'm not meeting my father.</font>

145
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I'm the reason
you'll come here after all.</font>

146
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I...</font>

147
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
What do you mean by "here"?</font>

148
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad's house,</font>

149
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:19,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I kind of, sort of, am.</font>

150
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:20,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, thanks, Sharon.</font>

151
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought
about it that way.</font>

152
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman is sort of gay.</font>

153
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.</font>

154
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on?</font>

155
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:29,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Thanksgiving
so terrible?</font>

156
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

157
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tension, the backbiting,
the judgmental comments.</font>

158
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">This makes Thanksgiving
with my family look...</font>

159
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">eh, still pretty bad.</font>

160
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said Batman was gay.</font>

161
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.
Sheesh.</font>

162
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask one lady
if she's Tyler Perry in drag,</font>

163
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:45,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">and suddenly,
you're the bad guy.</font>

164
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a reference.
That's my humor.</font>

165
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed gets it.</font>

166
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're all hiding out
in here.</font>

167
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:54,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not hiding.
- You know us, hide away.</font>

168
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, be careful.</font>

169
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:56,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be
giving the impression</font>

170
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:58,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you prefer the cold garage</font>

171
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:01,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the warm heart
of my hospitality.</font>

172
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? As if.</font>

173
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:04,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay.</font>

174
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.
Okay.</font>

175
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hurry back soon.</font>

176
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Jonestown
of dinners.</font>

177
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I'm in jail.</font>

178
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what happens
to guys like me in jail.</font>

179
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get really
into push-ups,</font>

180
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:19,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am fine with my upper body
the way it is!</font>

181
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It did feel like a prison,</font>

182
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:23,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that meant only one thing
made sense, conceptually.</font>

183
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had to break out.</font>

184
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And someone with the gravitas
of Morgan Freeman</font>

185
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">had to narrate it.</font>

186
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to do a prison break.</font>

187
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Thanksgiving?</font>

188
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really "you'd"
this one, huh?</font>

189
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yes, I meddled
against your wishes,</font>

190
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yes, I got this address
from the Dean,</font>

191
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:44,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">but hey.</font>

192
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had a moment of doubt,</font>

193
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here I am
to help you through it.</font>

194
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psychology tells us
there are no accidents.</font>

195
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

196
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about car accidents,
Tara Reid,</font>

197
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the Hindenburg?</font>

198
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here goes nothing.</font>

199
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, William.</font>

200
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:08,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh... how about we make
a couple of ground rules?</font>

201
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:11,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, that sounds good.
Okay. No hugs.</font>

202
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:12,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't want one.
No apologies.</font>

203
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't accept one.
No calling you "dad."</font>

204
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No expectations.
- No B.S.</font>

205
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drink?
- Scotch.</font>

206
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 18?
- Neat.</font>

207
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to acknowledge</font>

208
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">that there are a lot
of emotions flowing right now,</font>

209
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:25,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you two are probably
feeling a strong impulse</font>

210
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:26,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sleep with each other,</font>

211
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:29,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hey, that's normal.</font>

212
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:33,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
I'll get the drinks.</font>

213
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how about that?
No muss, no fuss.</font>

214
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:39,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I urge you not to run
from the muss and fuss.</font>

215
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

216
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:43,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

217
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be
my half-brother.</font>

218
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:48,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, your hands are so much
bigger than mine.</font>

219
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your nail beds are perfect.</font>

220
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do it.
I can't.</font>

221
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

222
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's coming up.</font>

223
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I get upset, I vomit.</font>

224
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:58,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see you've
met Willy Junior.</font>

225
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said he wasn't going
to replace me.</font>

226
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:03,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the Schwarzenegger.
I'm the DeVito.</font>

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.</font>

228
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fellas,
let's get right into it.</font>

229
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:12,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the big question
on everyone's mind is</font>

230
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't I go
help Willy Junior?</font>

231
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

232
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">One thing was clear to me
and the rest of the crew.</font>

233
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:23,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bennett lockup was not
where we belonged.</font>

234
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">We belonged in the sun,
with the wind in our hair,</font>

235
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">or maybe at a Bennigan's,
enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.</font>

236
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should tunnel out.</font>

237
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:30,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, Shirley is our friend,</font>

238
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:32,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're guests in her home.</font>

239
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a plan
that won't hurt her feelings,</font>

240
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">or damage her property.</font>

241
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Definitely don't look
behind that poster, then.</font>

242
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could pretend
to have a stroke.</font>

243
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do a gibberish
foreign language.</font>

244
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:44,836
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What if I did a gibberish
foreign language like Star Wars?</i></font>

245
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like that, I bet.
Dick.</font>

246
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:49,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sure we'll
figure out a way out of here.</font>

247
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:52,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's important right now
is that we stick together.</font>

248
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Oh, there you are.</font>

249
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants
a pre-dinner snack?</font>

250
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

251
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, pumpkin, what's wrong?</font>

252
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:02,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's too embarrassing</font>

253
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">to talk about
in front of the guys,</font>

254
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">know what I mean, girlfriend?</font>

255
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sweetie.</font>

256
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have your monthly shame?</font>

257
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to lie down
in Elijah's room?</font>

258
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't think
that's going to cut it.</font>

259
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I probably need to go home
and call Dr. Collins.</font>

260
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:14,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that bad.</font>

261
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, you know,</font>

262
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:17,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">my sister-in-law's
a gynecologist,</font>

263
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's right
in the other room.</font>

264
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need to bother
your doctor on a holiday.</font>

265
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.
Mm-hmm.</font>

266
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to tell you
Annie avoided.</font>

267
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's doctor
sister-in-law,</font>

268
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this ain't no fairy tale.</font>

269
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Thanksgiving.</font>

270
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:32,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see, what else?</font>

271
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got some diabetes,
on my mother's side.</font>

272
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:36,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to know.</font>

273
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:37,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like your hair.</font>

274
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">The presence of it, I mean.</font>

275
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:43,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I have a question,</font>

276
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's been weighing
on me pretty heavily.</font>

277
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:48,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">At your age, in the bedroom...</font>

278
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
It's all good.</font>

279
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Real good.</font>

280
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:55,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at them.
Bonding.</font>

281
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably laughing
'cause I can't grow a beard.</font>

282
00:09:58,394 --> 00:09:59,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea.</font>

283
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we
use these dinner rolls</font>

284
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do some "roll" play?</font>

285
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see what I did there.</font>

286
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

287
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">This roll, this is me.</font>

288
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's crying.</font>

289
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:14,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
That's really good.</font>

290
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:17,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, what do you do?</font>

291
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:20,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a lawyer
who faked a bachelor's degree</font>

292
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">and practiced law
for seven years</font>

293
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I got caught.</font>

294
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like your hustle.</font>

295
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:28,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reminds me of the summer
I was Ralph Lauren</font>

296
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">out in St. Tropez.</font>

297
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:32,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">'83, I'm on a boat with, uh...</font>

298
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Willy!</font>

299
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm expressing.
- Knock it off.</font>

300
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:38,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you just swallow it,
like any normal person?</font>

301
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh, right.
Like your new son.</font>

302
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like mister...
mister I've got my shirt...</font>

303
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know a lot of
personal details about you yet.</font>

304
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my name's Jeff.</font>

305
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:51,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't help me,
mister helper guy.</font>

306
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">First mom dies, now this?</font>

307
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, she died
20 years ago, Willy.</font>

308
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He keeps singing
the same old song.</font>

309
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:58,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
She died on you.</font>

310
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here I thought you'd
become father of the year,</font>

311
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you just got stuck.</font>

312
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:03,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, look,
I don't have to tell you</font>

313
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a natural caretaker,</font>

314
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">but with Willy, you know,
I-I checked all the boxes,</font>

315
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he still turned out
softer than wet cheese.</font>

316
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

317
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:15,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">He keeps saying he's going
to move out next week,</font>

318
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:16,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">since '03.</font>

319
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, I couldn't
wait to get out.</font>

320
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got my own place
when I was 18.</font>

321
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the same way.</font>

322
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:26,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's ready to eat?</font>

323
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you care
to carve the turkey?</font>

324
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it!</font>

325
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love him more than me.</font>

326
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:34,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you.
I'll run away.</font>

327
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.
Hey, be my guest.</font>

328
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:40,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">You run away, and I'm going
to sleep like a baby tonight.</font>

329
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now, I'm sorry
you guys had to see that,</font>

330
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">but maybe you could
shrink his head,</font>

331
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">since you're here
for some reason.</font>

332
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:52,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
I can do this.</font>

333
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me on the dinner roll
where you're hurt!</font>

334
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's how it went
for the afternoon.</font>

335
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">This tag team turkey day
became our routine.</font>

336
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">We endured the indignities
as best we could.</font>

337
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cousins fighting,
complaints about the food,</font>

338
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:07,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">listening to a nephew
do Borat for a full hour.</font>

339
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">We figured out ways
to steal away from time to time,</font>

340
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:13,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">saying we had to pee,
had to get ice,</font>

341
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">had to do a jewish thing
in the other room.</font>

342
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:20,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I became known as the guy
who could get you things</font>

343
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:24,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">piece of gum, playing cards,</font>

344
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">some novelty glasses I found
in a box marked "crap."</font>

345
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:30,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">In those brief,
tranquil moments, we felt human.</font>

346
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We felt free.</font>

347
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sooner or later,
our warden would come knocking.</font>

348
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:38,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly, we just waited
for our time to be served,</font>

349
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:40,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">but some didn't
take kindly to waiting.</font>

350
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some didn't
have much time left.</font>

351
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:44,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.
Amateur hour is over.</font>

352
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going in there,
pretend to break a hip,</font>

353
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll be sipping Sambuca
at skeepers in no time.</font>

354
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.
He tripped on the rug.</font>

355
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, now he's getting up.</font>

356
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's walking around dazed
like he's got a head injury.</font>

357
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, groin into the corner
of the table.</font>

358
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">This might actually work.</font>

359
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:06,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

360
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait,
why are people laughing?</font>

361
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:14,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see, I need a broom,
a rake, or two rakes...</font>

362
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you were supposed
to pretend to injure yourself</font>

363
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:17,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we could leave.</font>

364
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave?</font>

365
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,831
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is my
showtime at the Apollo.</i></font>

366
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:23,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm killing out there.</font>

367
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce was our last hope,
or so we thought.</font>

368
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:31,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seemed Troy Barnes
had a plan.</font>

369
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we got sick?</font>

370
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No more faking illnesses.</font>

371
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:40,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not fake sick.
Real sick.</font>

372
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's when I told
my old firm to shove it.</font>

373
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:53,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always been more
of a free agent, anyway.</font>

374
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I can see that about you.</font>

375
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem
like a self-made man.</font>

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I kind of had to be.</font>

377
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to break a rule.</font>

378
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we said
"no mushy stuff,"</font>

379
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">but for what it's worth,
I'm proud of you.</font>

380
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
Thanks.</font>

381
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes you think.</font>

382
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what do you mean?</font>

383
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:18,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look, I mean, you've
seen how Willy turned out.</font>

384
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I haven't
done that kid any favors.</font>

385
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so I look at you,</font>

386
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">so self-reliant
and well-adjusted,</font>

387
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think
maybe I did something right.</font>

388
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did something right?</font>

389
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:33,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let me
say that different.</font>

390
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, the universe
is a constantly expanding...</font>

391
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">stop.</font>

392
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get the impulse, but
that's not going to work here.</font>

393
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I just mean that, uh,</font>

394
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:42,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are defined
by what happens to us,</font>

395
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:46,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">and me leaving seems
to have made you independent,</font>

396
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:47,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">made you strong.</font>

397
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:51,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all due respect,
which is none,</font>

398
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">go to hell.</font>

399
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tunneling out
is off the table?</font>

400
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:58,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's hungry for turkey?</font>

401
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, we were just...</font>

402
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:00,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">About to...</font>

403
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat garbage dip.</font>

404
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did I have to go third?</font>

405
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I get it.
You want to leave.</font>

406
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, we're sorry.</font>

407
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm sorry.</font>

408
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest, I invited you
as a bit of a buffer.</font>

409
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Andre's family,
I'm always the butt of the joke,</font>

410
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and with Andre gone this year,</font>

411
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I could tip the scales
in my favor</font>

412
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">by having a few friends around.</font>

413
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was wrong of me.</font>

414
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you Monday.</font>

415
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
none of us noticed</font>

416
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">she was having
such a hard time.</font>

417
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't leave.</font>

418
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny thing about prison.</font>

419
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:38,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes the person
you thought was your warden</font>

420
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">turns out
to be a fellow prisoner,</font>

421
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,104
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>which doesn't really line up
with the whole Shawshank thing,</i></font>

422
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,355
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but maybe we've always been doing
more of a Prison Break.</i></font>

423
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:45,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">The show.</font>

424
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:56,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa, what are you doing in my car?
- Take me with you.</font>

425
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teach me what you know.</font>

426
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the cat's cradle
is happening?</font>

427
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad hates me.</font>

428
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you care
what that guy thinks?</font>

429
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a dick.</font>

430
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, that's
what I need to learn!</font>

431
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to be all dead inside
with muscles on top,</font>

432
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">not all emotional and flabby.</font>

433
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you are emotional,</font>

434
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if you pretend you're not,</font>

435
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:14,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're only letting him
off the hook</font>

436
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">for being a terrible father,</font>

437
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">which he is
and always has been.</font>

438
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
he meant the world to you,</font>

439
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you meant nothing to him,</font>

440
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:26,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if you run away now,
he'll never know.</font>

441
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should know.</font>

442
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's the worst.</font>

443
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!
Jeez.</font>

444
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
I thought you guys left.</font>

445
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We started as your buffer,</font>

446
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're busting you
out of here now.</font>

447
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

448
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drew a map of your house
on my stomach.</font>

449
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I know what my house
looks like.</font>

450
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I said.</font>

451
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if we act fast,
we can get through this plan,</font>

452
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is to put you
in the trash can,</font>

453
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">take you out like trash,</font>

454
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we got to dress you
like a baby.</font>

455
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much
for doing this,</font>

456
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm not going anywhere.</font>

457
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people up there,
they may be rude,</font>

458
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">they may be pushy,</font>

459
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">they may have come
to some wrongheaded conclusions</font>

460
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">about Batman and Robin...</font>

461
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

462
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're my family,</font>

463
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">and family means
putting up with each other</font>

464
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">even when it's hard.</font>

465
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can go.
I'll be fine.</font>

466
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, we're going to stay.</font>

467
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Yeah.</font>

468
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family sticks it out.</font>

469
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ni...</font>

470
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, full disclosure.</font>

471
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're hiding out
from that crazy white guy.</font>

472
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came back!</font>

473
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

474
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should take some credit
for who I've become.</font>

475
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

476
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:35,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let me tell you
how I turned out,</font>

477
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so you're crystal clear
on your impact.</font>

478
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not well-adjusted.</font>

479
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">More often than not,
I am barely keeping it together.</font>

480
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm constantly texting,</font>

481
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's no one
at the other end.</font>

482
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a grown man</font>

483
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">who can't even
look his own friends</font>

484
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the eye for too long</font>

485
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm afraid
that they'll see</font>

486
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:57,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I am broken.</font>

487
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you get credit for that.</font>

488
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, now...</font>

489
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time,
when I was in seventh grade,</font>

490
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:06,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told everybody at school
that I had appendicitis.</font>

491
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted someone
to worry about me.</font>

492
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when Beth Brannon asked
to see the scar,</font>

493
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to get found out,</font>

494
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I took mom's scissors,
and I made one.</font>

495
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hurt like hell,
but it was worth it.</font>

496
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:23,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I got 17 cards,</font>

497
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I still keep them in a box
underneath my bed</font>

498
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">22 years later</font>

499
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it proves that someone,</font>

500
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">at some point, cared about me.</font>

501
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to see the scar?</font>

502
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you get credit
for that, too.</font>

503
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is me.</font>

504
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Jeff, I, uh...</font>

505
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy!</font>

506
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you faking a heart attack?</font>

507
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of a Hail Mary.</font>

508
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:54,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Thanksgiving, dad.</font>

509
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you're probably
feeling a very strong urge</font>

510
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sleep with me right now,</font>

511
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that is normal.</font>

512
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sha.</font>

513
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, thank you.</font>

514
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

515
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going to get all
"jock jams" on me, are you?</font>

516
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course not.</font>

517
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left my boom box at school.</font>

518
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:24,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Jeez.</font>

519
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to stop doing that.</font>

520
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Come here, brother.</font>

521
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Come here, brother.</font>

522
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

523
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:31,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you save some
for Christmas, buddy, okay?</font>

524
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Pierce did whiteface
over blackface.</font>

525
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one was amused.</font>

526
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's meta.
Abed gets it.</font>

527
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Troy, how was
your first real Thanksgiving?</font>

528
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">No offense to Shirley,</font>

529
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:42,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't see
what the fuss is about.</font>

530
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanksgiving's the wors...</font>

531
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

532
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard your Thanksgiving
wasn't much better than mine,</font>

533
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I thought
we could take some time</font>

534
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">and be grateful
for our real family.</font>

535
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one we chose.</font>

536
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So pretty.
- Sit, sit, sit.</font>

537
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,415
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We never got
to do a Shawshank homage,</i></font>

538
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">not the way I wanted to.</font>

539
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the hardest prisons
to break out of</font>

540
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:07,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the ones without locks.</font>

541
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, that doesn't
make any sense.</font>

542
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:11,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that day, Jeff seemed
like a man unburdened.</font>

543
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me
about seeing his father again,</font>

544
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how leaving there
felt like breaking free</font>

545
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">of an emotional prison
he'd been in for years.</font>

546
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something about shackles
on his heart?</font>

547
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be honest,
I stopped listening.</font>

548
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking about Christmas.</font>

549
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,388
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hope we do Die Hard.</i></font>

550
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it's in a restaurant.</font>

551
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it lays out as cleanly
as it does in my dreams.</font>

552
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it's cool.</font>

553
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:30,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, cool, cool.</font>

554
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cheers.
- Cheers.</font>

555
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Thanksgiving, everyone,
including you, Dean.</font>

556
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:00,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my.</font>

557
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:05,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to remember this
for next year.</font>
