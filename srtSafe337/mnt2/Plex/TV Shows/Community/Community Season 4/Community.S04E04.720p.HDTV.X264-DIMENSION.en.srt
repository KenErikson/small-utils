<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, 12 o'clock.</font>

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">The "History of Ice Cream" class
is letting out.</font>

3
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:09,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as informative
as it is delicious!</font>

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That class should've been ours.</font>

5
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the final
is a sundae bar.</font>

6
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:14,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- I don't get history.</font>

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wanted to know
what happened in Europe</font>

8
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:16,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">a long time ago,</font>

9
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'd watch Game of Thrones.</i></font>

10
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:19,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, that show takes place
in a fantasy realm.</font>

11
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:21,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">This class is
about the real world.</font>

12
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the show.</font>

13
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to think
before you speak.</font>

14
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard this teacher's
a real hard-ass.</font>

15
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:29,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's British,
and he has a degree.</font>

16
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:30,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't have
a hard-buns teacher.</font>

17
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:31,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already starting
a new business.</font>

18
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">When am I supposed to see
my family?</font>

19
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">And last week,
Ben took his first steps</font>

20
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:35,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">without me.</font>

21
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:36,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick impression.
"Wah."</font>

22
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:37,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who am I?
You guys.</font>

23
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! Dead on.</font>

24
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:41,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know
"the History of Ice Cream"</font>

25
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">would have been fun,</font>

26
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:44,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not only will this class
be much less likely</font>

27
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give us type 2 diabetes.</font>

28
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might actually learn
so... n of a bitch!</font>

29
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those annoying Germans
are back?</font>

30
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:53,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought they transferred
after they lost</font>

31
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">their foosball scholarship.</font>

32
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:56,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard they were juicing.</font>

33
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, them leaving would mean
Greendale got slightly better,</font>

34
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:02,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">which, as we know,
does not happen.</font>

35
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:05,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lukas, Karl, I see you've grown
a new douche bag.</font>

36
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Reinhold.</font>

37
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you know
my brother Juergen.</font>

between you two, ja?</i></font>

39
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

40
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there is one thing
Germans don't do,</font>

41
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's hold a grudge.</font>

42
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:18,754
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Unless we're talking
about Die Hard 3.</i></font>

43
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the 20th century.</font>

44
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, everyone.</font>

45
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:23,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning.</font>

46
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Professor Cornwallis.</font>

47
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:28,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what
you're all thinking,</font>

48
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the answer is...</font>

49
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I am a direct descendant</font>

50
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">of general
Sir Charles Cornwallis,</font>

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">who surrendered
the British forces at Yorktown.</font>

52
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was anyone thinking that?</font>

53
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

54
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">History is written...</font>

55
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the victors.</font>

56
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, of course,
we all know the quote.</font>

57
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it mean?</font>

58
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:49,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to Oxford University,</font>

59
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:53,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">it means that my 20 years'
loyal service there</font>

60
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">means nothing
next to a little slipup</font>

61
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a co-ed.</font>

62
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:00,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.
But what it really means</font>

63
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that history can be seen</font>

64
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">from aultitude
of vantage points.</font>

65
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, for your first test
on Monday...</font>

66
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:11,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm confused.
When do we get our ice cream?</font>

67
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to challenge you
to look at history</font>

68
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:15,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">from all perspectives.</font>

69
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:18,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would the story read
if it was written</font>

70
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:20,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">not by the victors,</font>

71
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">but by the vanquished?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ja.</i></font>

73
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">How indeed?</font>

74
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was recalling

He doesn't.</font>

His name is Chang.</font>

97
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,142

It's not uncommon</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">some syntactical confusion.</font>

102
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,502

224
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,906

<font color="#FFFFFF">and see our families
and think things through, huh?</font>

available?</font>

241
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like
a Darren Aronofsky film.</font>

248
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like that, wouldn't you?</font>

249
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:52,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of the thing, Pierce.</font>

250
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it smells like barbecue.</font>

251
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:56,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting up
earlier tomorrow.</font>

252

258
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my...
That's it.</font>

259
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,044

<font color="#FFFFFF">Without so much as a drop
of moisturizer!</font>

267
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did all that?</font>

268
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:18,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Chang did all that?</font>

269
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's true,</font>

270
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">then Chang, who is me,</font>

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">deserves to go to jail.</font>

272
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:25,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he did.</font>

273
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:27,419

306
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a show
about a bunch of goofy Nazis</font>

307
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">running a prison camp,</font>

308
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,462

- Yes.</i></font>

310
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">And while, for a latchkey kid
with no jewish friends,</font>

311
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was a bit desensitizing,</font>

312
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">it still taught me</font>

313
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the lovable misfits
always win.</font>

314
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the bumbling Germans
always lose.</font>

315
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we need is a clever ruse.</font>

316
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike that.
All we need is a ruse.</font>

317
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had me at "ruse."</font>

318
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the last thing I said.</font>

319
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good thing you said it.</font>

320
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

321
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Oktoberfest.</font>

322
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,569

- Call it a peace offering.</font>

323
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,187

We lost.</font>

324
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's end this dumb war
and move on.</font>

325

authentic blutwurst?</font>

326

<font color="#FFFFFF">This stuff's the real deal.</font>

327
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:32,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got it
down in little Munich.</font>

328
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been banned by the FDA.</font>

329
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh!
- No, Karl!</font>

330
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">That blutwurst was
probably injected</font>

331
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a laxative to make us pull
a grete waitz</font>

332
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">in our trousers.</font>

333
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,620

00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing gross
in this sausage.</font>

335
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:47,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just pig's blood stuffed
into a cow's intestine.</font>

336
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,128
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Gott, that must be
nearly 100 luftballons!</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot! Do not accept
their gifts.</font>

338
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:55,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something is clearly up.</font>

339
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, these are just
small tokens of our friendship.</font>

340
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:58,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

341
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:01,205
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dirndls, blutwurst,
luftballons.</i></font>

342
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cartoonishly large cake.</font>

343
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a ruse.</font>

344
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:07,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It is exactly like an episode
of Hogan's Villains.</i></font>

345
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ruse?
This is no ruse.</font>

346
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:12,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just take that large cake
back to the study room</font>

347
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">and enjoy it there.</font>

348
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's nothing hiding</font>

349
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">inside this giant
German chocolate cake?</font>

350
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask Abed.</font>

351
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:23,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can trust him.
He's a friend.</font>

352
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:24,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. Just solid cake.</font>

353
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

354
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you wouldn't mind if I...</font>

355
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the cake?</font>

356
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you could save it for later.</font>

357
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to share it.</font>

358
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley stayed up all night
baking that for you.</font>

359
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:37,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.
I just used the eggs</font>

360
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:38,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would've used
for my son's breakfast.</font>

361
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:40,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it would be so easy for me</font>

362
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">to carve into this cake...</font>

363
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:44,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">And serve us all!</font>

364
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

365
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:47,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it. Sorry.</font>

366
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:49,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought you were
stupider than this.</font>

367
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy.</font>

368
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I release the tear gas,
or has that ship sank?</font>

369
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">An excellent attempt, Vinger,</font>

370
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:02,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we are smarter than you,
and once again,</font>

372
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">the smooth and somewhat

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Beer me, bitte.</i></font>

374
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,526

375
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,194

377
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:16,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as they say in the movie,
gotcha!</font>

378
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:20,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotcha.</font>

379
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Busted.
- Busted?</font>

380
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

381
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there were dozens
of students</font>

382
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">at that Oktoberfest.</font>

383
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you were the only
German students</font>

384
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:29,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">celebrating German culture,</font>

385
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here at Greendale,
that is a big, fat no-no.</font>

386
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:36,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">We frown on anyone celebrating
their own cultural heritage.</font>

387
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,753

student union wants</font>

390
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:45,009

swimming pools... huh.</font>

397
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of these

00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">That puts Greendale on the map.</font>

458
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your health comes second,
whoop, first,</font>

459
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the school.</font>

460
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, let's not hug.
Do you mind getting my...</font>

461
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:22,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

462
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably shouldn't step on it.</font>

463
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel guilty eating this cake.</font>

464
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not for the usual reasons.</font>

465
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hate to say it,
but this is what happens</font>

466
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">when a group of people
blindly follows</font>

467
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">a charismatic,
golden-throated leader.</font>

468
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you actually comparing me
to Hitler?</font>

469
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are similarities.</font>

470
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.
Nobody's even willing</font>

471
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">to consider that I might be
the Hitler of this group?</font>

472
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were the good guys.</font>

473
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could everybody think
we're the bad guys?</font>

474
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are.</font>

475
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:49,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Karl and I were raiding
the Diamond North Caves,</font>

476
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was facing 50 Death Beatles.</font>

477
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would've perished for sure,
but he saved me.</font>

478
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then when I had a chance
to return the favor,</font>

479
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:54,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I looked him in the eye, and I
told him it was solid cake.</font>

480
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:56,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were just following orders.</font>

481
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:57,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's probably a way I can
make it up to him.</font>

482
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

483
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:01,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll give him
my four-pronged trident.</font>

484
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you call it
a "quadrident"?</font>

485
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:04,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shh.
- Ah!</font>

486
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you people are.</font>

487
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:10,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we have something
to discuss.</font>

488
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

489
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You clever British bastard.</font>

490
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You set this whole thing up
to teach us a lesson.</font>

491
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Making the school pretend</font>

492
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hate us,
to show us that one man's hero</font>

493
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:22,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">is another man's villain.</font>

494
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course!
We aren't Nazis.</font>

495
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tip my cap to you, sir.</font>

496
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lesson learned.</font>

497
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you actually suggesting</font>

498
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:31,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a Professor at Greendale</font>

499
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">would set up an elaborate ruse</font>

500
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:35,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">just to teach
seven students a lesson?</font>

501
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:36,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.</font>

502
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- That's a Wednesday.</font>

503
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

504
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:43,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made a terrible mistake
coming here.</font>

505
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this wasn't part
of the class?</font>

506
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:47,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you here?</font>

507
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you had a test today,</font>

508
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you all missed it!</font>

509
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:50,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">"F's for everyone.</font>

510
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:52,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

511
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's not too late</font>

512
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get out of my contract.</font>

513
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I really am Hitler.
- Yeah.</font>

514
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's just decided.</font>

515
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:04,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">No vote or anything.</font>

516
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this.</font>

517
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish there was a way
that we could</font>

518
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">make it up to people.</font>

519
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

520
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to make reparations.</font>

521
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to start giving back</font>

522
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:18,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Greendale
has given us so much.</font>

523
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:20,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">It gave us the study room.</font>

524
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:24,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that study room
is our home.</font>

525
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:29,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our home is more
than those four walls.</font>

526
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:34,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">And our family is more
than the seven of us.</font>

527
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:38,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all of Greendale.</font>

528
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone deserves to have
what we have.</font>

529
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:45,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know?</font>

530
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale just got
slightly better.</font>

531
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to be back.</font>

532
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:54,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we go celebrate
at Skeeper's?</font>

533
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Shirley.
We all have lives.</font>

534
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are!</font>

535
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so proud
how you stepped up</font>

536
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">and made amends.</font>

537
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone forgave you.</font>

538
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when it comes
right down to it,</font>

539
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:06,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale's a forgiving place.</font>

540
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really is.</font>

541
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please keep that in mind
the next 20 seconds.</font>

542
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that people
can "Chang".</font>

543
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can what?</font>

544
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

545
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,494

00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,291
