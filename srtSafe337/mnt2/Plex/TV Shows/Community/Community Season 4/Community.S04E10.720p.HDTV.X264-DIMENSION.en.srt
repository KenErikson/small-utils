00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:03,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's open!</font>

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:08,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at us. Our group's
first grown-up Christmas party.</font>

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for hosting.
I hope you don't mind.</font>

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought a few things
just to make the place</font>

5
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">look a little less short-term
corporate housing.</font>

6
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,724
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, well,
mi casa es su art project.</i></font>

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

8
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:21,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figured
just a little something there,</font>

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little zhuzh right there.</font>

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a few things
to add a little Annie.</font>

11
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, do we have to have
another talk</font>

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">about you wanting
to play house with me?</font>

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sha.
Sha-na-not.</font>

14
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just decorating
for a party.</font>

15
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I saw these curtains,
and I couldn't resist.</font>

16
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just live with them
for a night.</font>

17
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can totally return them.
Oh, let's totally return them.</font>

18
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:46,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.
Live with them for one night.</font>

19
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, these will also work
for Valentine's day,</font>

20
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:51,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">presidents day,
whenever people get to see it.</font>

21
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:55,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, what is this?</font>

22
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
I know we said no gifts,</font>

23
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I couldn't resist.</font>

24
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize you've just put
your friends</font>

25
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a very awkward position.</font>

26
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift creates obligation.</font>

27
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see it that way.</font>

28
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do, and I think
the others will too.</font>

29
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Merry Christmas.</font>

30
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:13,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we said no gifts,
but I couldn't resist.</font>

31
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:15,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, who couldn't have seen
that coming?</font>

32
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie, I love
what you did with the place.</font>

33
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:19,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a work in progress.</font>

34
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good tidings,
fellow Christmas celebrators.</font>

35
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to all a good wassailing.</font>

36
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:26,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we said no gifts,
but we couldn't resist.</font>

37
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:30,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a real problem
with resistance in this group.</font>

38
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.
Thank you all so much</font>

39
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">for inviting me
to my first Christmas.</font>

40
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:37,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie explained to me that
"no gifts" means "bring gifts."</font>

41
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:40,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting it.
No means yes.</font>

42
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is Christmas.
Just this.</font>

43
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,546
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was hoping we could do
a Die Hard in a restaurant.</i></font>

44
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:47,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a place
called Nakatomi Sushi.</font>

45
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:49,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the Hans Grouper
is to die for.</font>

46
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, people, it's all
spelled out in your evites.</font>

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you opened them.
Oh, I brought gifts.</font>

48
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does Annie live here now?</font>

49
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:59,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Now that we're all here...</font>

50
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait.
Where's Pierce?</font>

51
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:03,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sensitivity training
with Gilbert.</font>

52
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:05,516
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Apparently watching Invictus
didn't do the trick.</i></font>

53
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Okay.</font>

54
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now that we are all here,</font>

55
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have some good news
and some bad news.</font>

56
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.
Black licorice?</font>

57
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to start
with the bad news.</font>

58
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about our history paper.</font>

59
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard through back channels
we got a failing grade.</font>

60
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Kendra told me.</font>

61
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">She does assistant work
for Professor cornwallis.</font>

62
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet she does.</font>

63
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We failed?
This is terrible.</font>

64
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need that paper to graduate.</font>

65
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who screwed up their section?</font>

66
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff, it doesn't matter.
- No, it matters to me.</font>

67
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know who cost me
my early graduation.</font>

68
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I worked really hard.</font>

69
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, there's no need
to point fingers,</font>

70
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I haven't told you
the good news.</font>

71
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invited the Professor
to our party tonight.</font>

72
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie!
- What? How is that better?</font>

73
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, Annie's right.
This could work.</font>

74
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the grade isn't etched
in stone.</font>

75
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:50,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, these British guys
like to socialize</font>

76
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">with their students.</font>

77
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need to show him
a good time,</font>

78
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:55,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">laugh at his jokes,</font>

79
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">love whatever he loves,
and by the end of the night</font>

80
00:02:57,235 --> 00:03:00,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you we can get that grade
back up to a "c."</font>

81
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:00,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows?
Maybe even an "a."</font>

82
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or something realistic.</font>

83
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:04,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just like that
our pleasant holiday party</font>

84
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">turned into a tense,
high-stakes secret mission.</font>

85
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:08,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No costumes.
No funny voices.</font>

86
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Okay.</font>

87
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, for the purpose
of story symmetry,</font>

88
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest we wait here silently
until the Professor arrives.</font>

89
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only real plot point
we need next.</font>

90
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,425

this is ridic...</font>

00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,808

I can't stay long.</font>

103

<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't want to appear rude.</font>

105
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:01,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I expected to bring a gift?</font>

106
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:04,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Nor was anyone else.</font>

107
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I show you around,
starting with the bar?</font>

108
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lovely place.
Very feminine.</font>

109
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear him
use "feminine" as an insult?</font>

110
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:14,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typical phallo-centric
worldview.</font>

111

<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet he gave us
a failing grade</font>

112
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he could tell my section</font>

I've just seen an old friend.</font>

115
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry back soon.</font>

116
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abed,
got you an early Christmas gift.</font>

00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,077
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know you were bummed about not
doing Die Hard in a restaurant.</i></font>

00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your recent divorce.</font>

119
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yippee-ki-yay, Father Christmas.</font>

120
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to get you
"taking off shoes,"</font>

121
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I didn't know
how to wrap it.</font>

122
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">John McClane's tank top?</font>

123
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:43,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're getting really good
at Christmas, Troy.</font>

124
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, things
I've never seen before.</font>

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Macallan Eighteen.</font>

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,745

if that's okay with you?</font>

127
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, in America?</font>

128
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you mix it
with cherry pop</font>

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">or Monterey Jack cheese?</font>

130
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor,
these are melon slices with ham.</font>

131
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">And asparagus
wrapped in salmon.</font>

132
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see somebody's
been attempting tapas.</font>

133
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that would be me.</font>

134
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think cuisine is like
a window into history.</font>

I was talking to the ladies.</font>

137
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

138
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll let... I'll leave
you three be, all right?</font>

139
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

140
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:17,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the Professor
seems to be responding</font>

141
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">to things that I don't have,</font>

142
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:20,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you gotta get in there
and jiggle something.</font>

143
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hates me.</font>

144
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called me Broken Barbie
all year.</font>

145
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're all gonna have
to work it</font>

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we're gonna get
that grade changed.</font>

147
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be honest.
Your section sucked, right?</font>

148
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:33,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way. I read an entire book
on the Peloponnesian War.</font>

149
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:35,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
You pronounced it right.</font>

150
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then someone else
had to tank it</font>

151
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:38,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">for us to get that "f."</font>

152
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone else?</font>

153
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.</font>

154
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I blew my section off.
- What?</font>

155
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there was
a secret Tom Waits show in town,</font>

156
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:48,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I did the math.</font>

157
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:50,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's seven sections
to the paper.</font>

158
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie gets an "a,"
Pierce buys his from Neil,</font>

159
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that's solid.</font>

160
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you guys get
"b's and "c's,</font>

161
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, I figured
if my section gets an "f,"</font>

162
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:59,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">the worst we could end up
with is a "c-minus."</font>

163
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you just left
your section blank?</font>

164
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:02,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course not.</font>

165
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,788
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I copied and pasted the lyrics
to war, what is it good for?</i></font>

166
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good God.
- Shh.</font>

167
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friends
were counting on you.</font>

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's their fault.</font>

169
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have carefully cultivated</font>

170
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">a persona that screams,
"you're on your own."</font>

171
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:15,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my judgey face.</font>

172
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noted.
I'll make it right.</font>

173
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going back in.</font>

174
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it going?
Well, he asked me to get</font>

175
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">my fit bum to the kitchen
for a refill,</font>

176
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:26,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that's good, right?</font>

177
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kevin's showing him
a card trick.</font>

178
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:31,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Oh, God.</font>

179
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a card?</font>

180
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it isn't.
Queen of Hearts.</font>

181
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm asking, is this a card?</font>

182
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Kevin, did you know
that we have bubble wrap?</font>

183
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Poppy poppy paper.</font>

184
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:43,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I so enjoy that.
Do you mind if I pop some?</font>

185
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, go crazy.</font>

186
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Changnesia.</font>

187
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
why do you indulge that idiot?</font>

188
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I, too, was skeptical
at first,</font>

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now I actually have
some sympathy.</font>

190
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:53,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe
it was tacitus who said...</font>

191
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Mr. Winger,
your pathetic attempts</font>

192
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">to suck up to me
are a wee bit transparent.</font>

193
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can only surmise
that it's something to do</font>

194
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:02,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the "c-minus" I gave you
for that final paper.</font>

195
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">"C-minus"?</font>

196
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.
Is this the...</font>

197
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:07,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll excuse us.</font>

198
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, he's giving us
a "c-minus."</font>

199
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- A "c-minus"</font>

200
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:12,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not a failing grade.</font>

201
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me, it is.</font>

202
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on a Valedictorian track,</font>

203
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a "c-minus" means I fail
to get Valedictorian.</font>

204
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:19,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ruined our Christmas dinner</font>

205
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you could be crowned
the smartest person</font>

206
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the dumbest school?</font>

207
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the only reason I agreed</font>

208
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:26,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">to kiss
that pompous anglo's ass</font>

209
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">was because I thought
we were getting an "f."</font>

210
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news, Mr. Winger.</font>

211
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may remove your lips
from my buttocks,</font>

212
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you have
in fact succeeded</font>

213
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:34,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">in changing your grade.</font>

214
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's now an "f."
What?</font>

215
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're "f" -ing us?</font>

216
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, if you could
just give us a minute,</font>

217
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">this has been
a terrible misunderstanding,</font>

218
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:47,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm sure we can get
this whole thing sorted out.</font>

219
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bedroom.
Now.</font>

220
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff just got us an "f."</font>

221
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:55,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought we had an "f."
- No, we were lied to.</font>

222
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't fun.
That guy's creepy.</font>

223
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if there's
a human version</font>

224
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Scrooge McDuck,
this guy is it.</font>

225
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wouldn't have happened</font>

226
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:01,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Jeff hadn't taunted him.</font>

227
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't decided</font>

228
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">a "c-minus" isn't good enough.</font>

229
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">When are you gonna grow up
and realize</font>

230
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">that grades don't matter
outside of school?</font>

231
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lie they tell
dumb people</font>

232
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:12,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they're fitting them
for work boots.</font>

233
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we needed
was a passing grade,</font>

234
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we had it until you
dragged us into this mess.</font>

235
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:19,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Judgey face.
- All right.</font>

236
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will talk to him, man to man,</font>

237
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">and try to get
our "c-minus" back.</font>

238
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:24,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

239
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, it's the best
we can do right now.</font>

240
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me handle this.
Let go of me,</font>

241
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">you big, hairy nutter!</font>

242
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm proving my worth
to you guys.</font>

243
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:35,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me to kill him?</font>

244
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kevin bad!
- I have Changnesia.</font>

245
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:41,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a dog.</font>

246
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:43,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, we're so sorry.</font>

247
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously,
Kevin made a mistake.</font>

248
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did he?</font>

249
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you
"or did he" -ing him?</font>

250
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying the Professor
can't get any more tied up,</font>

251
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can't get any less
than an "f,"</font>

252
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let's just take a beat
and think this through.</font>

253
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,264
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay, this is way better
than Die Hard in a restaurant.</i></font>

254
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:00,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what exactly
is your plan here, Mr. Winger?</font>

255
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I'm certainly
not gonna change your grade,</font>

256
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it'll take several days
to starve me</font>

257
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">as I really loaded up
on that dreadful tapas.</font>

258
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but you already
have changed it, Professor.</font>

259
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:13,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just dropped it to an "f,"</font>

260
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">thereby proving the work
on the page</font>

261
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:16,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not the only factor
you consider.</font>

262
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:19,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, thanks to Kevin's
complete misreading</font>

263
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:22,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the situation, we have
our moment of maximum leverage,</font>

264
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:24,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let's just talk
about this "f."</font>

265
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it can come up
to a "c-minus," or, who knows,</font>

266
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps an "a."</font>

267
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is actually a felony.</font>

268
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I will call the police,</font>

269
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will all go to jail.</font>

270
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:37,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me explain to you
why you won't do that.</font>

271
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, he's tied up.</font>

272
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:40,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, you're tied up,
and second,</font>

273
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">who can really be sure
what happened in this apartment?</font>

274
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you attacked one of us.</font>

275
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:47,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?
Where are the signs of struggle?</font>

276
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- You were full of scotch</font>

277
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">when things took a dark turn.</font>

278
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:54,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd all heard
about your troubles with co-eds</font>

279
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:55,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">back at Oxford,</font>

280
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:59,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was becoming
all too real.</font>

281
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you lumbered around the room,
we had to assume</font>

282
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:03,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were coming after me
or Britta.</font>

283
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah-ah-ahem!</font>

284
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:05,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Shirley,</font>

285
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">who I didn't mention earlier,</font>

286
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she intimidates you
sexually.</font>

287
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Point being,</font>

288
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's just take the idea
of the police</font>

289
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">off the table, shall we,
Professor?</font>

290
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. You think you can hold
this group together</font>

291
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:20,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">without anyone cracking?</font>

292
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:22,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we're solid.</font>

293
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Empires are always destroyed
from within.</font>

294
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can prove it to you</font>

295
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the comparative comfort
of this tacky chair.</font>

296
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give an "a" right now</font>

297
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:35,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the first person
that unties me.</font>

298
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of you will fail.</font>

299
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay where you are.</font>

300
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is amazing</font>

301
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">and possibly all in real time.</font>

302
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, stop it.
No one listen to him.</font>

303
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Professor's job
is to make us turn</font>

304
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:48,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">on one another.
We hold all the cards</font>

305
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:51,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">as long as we stay united.</font>

306
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Kevin, you're one of us.</font>

307
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:55,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- All right.</font>

308
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:58,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who will be the betrayer...</font>

309
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:01,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">the type-a lolita,</font>

310
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">the put-upon housewife...
Is that me?</font>

311
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or how about you,
the odd, emotionless Muslim?</font>

312
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, come on,
you don't deserve an "f."</font>

313
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know that,
because of your impairment,</font>

314
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:14,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll forgive you anyway.</font>

315
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">All true, but I'm probably
not your best target.</font>

316
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:17,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't mind,
I'd like to get some popcorn.</font>

317
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typically, it takes a while
for villains to ramp up.</font>

318
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise not to monologue
till I get back?</font>

319
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:23,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up, Professor.
You got nothing.</font>

320
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I've got plenty.</font>

321
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:27,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we just let him go
and be done with this?</font>

322
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Christmas.
We have gifts to unwrap.</font>

323
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:31,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see? We can't now
or someone will get the "a."</font>

324
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one wants to screw the group.</font>

325
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you see that, Professor?</font>

326
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your offer
actually made it harder</font>

327
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you to get untied,</font>

328
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">because no one wants
to be the betrayer.</font>

329
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:42,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beware the ides of march,
Mr. Winger.</font>

330
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone wants to be
the betrayer.</font>

331
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:47,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is your game?</font>

332
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying
to teach you history.</font>

333
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:53,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your failure will be the same
as any self-obsessed nation.</font>

334
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only care about each other
when you're winning.</font>

335
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Romans loved Rome</font>

336
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">when it was raping
half the world,</font>

337
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:01,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when Hannibal
came charging over the Alps,</font>

338
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Romans turned on themselves</font>

339
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:06,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">as quickly as you can say,
"e pluribus unum."</font>

340
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure it's "anus."</font>

341
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:12,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually, the cracks are hidden
within the alliances.</font>

342
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's see.</font>

343
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any group of seven,</font>

344
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:17,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's bound to be
some romantic entanglements.</font>

345
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I've noticed
that the damaged blonde</font>

346
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:23,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">is dating
the childish black one,</font>

347
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:26,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder, does anyone
take issue with that pairing?</font>

348
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:27,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're fishing, Professor.
No one has anything</font>

349
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">against Britta and Troy dating.</font>

350
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's coming from Jeff,</font>

351
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we used to date, so...</font>

352
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, information is ammo.</font>

353
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:36,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what we did was not dating.</font>

354
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh.
- Ah. A little friction.</font>

355
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">That usually indicates heat.</font>

356
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heat?
There's no heat.</font>

357
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:43,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there was heat,
I'd be nervous,</font>

358
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, if I was nervous,
I'd be rambling,</font>

359
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:47,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm definitely not rambling,
so there's no heat.</font>

360
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, well, I think
we found our triangle.</font>

361
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you
and welcome to the party, Troy.</font>

362
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows my name.</font>

363
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, keep it together.</font>

364
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:06,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed something great,
didn't I?</font>

365
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.
It's time to stop arsing about</font>

366
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get serious.</font>

367
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:11,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's hear it
from the one person</font>

368
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">who needs that "a" the most</font>

369
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">and can't possibly abide
by an "f,"</font>

370
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:22,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one person on pace
to become class Valedictorian.</font>

371
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never turn
against the group.</font>

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not talking
about you, miss Edison.</font>

373
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Abed?</font>

374
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff?
Is it me?</font>

375
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, Britta?</font>

376
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all, it's me,
and, second of all,</font>

377
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">you put Britta ahead of me?</font>

378
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">None taken.</font>

379
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:38,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, Shirley.</font>

380
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you ever tell me
about it?</font>

381
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think
it was a competition.</font>

382
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, of course
you'd play it that way</font>

383
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:44,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I wouldn't be expecting...</font>

384
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">A church-going mother of three
to be smart, huh?</font>

385
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:51,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, miss Edison,
it's decision time, isn't it?</font>

386
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, don't listen to him.</font>

387
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:55,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know you can't make
Valedictorian with an "f,"</font>

388
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you can eliminate your
competition in one easy step.</font>

389
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else do you have
to lose, my dear?</font>

390
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:04,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, these people,
they're not here to support you.</font>

391
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, they already hate you
for this disaster of a party.</font>

392
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not this guy.</font>

393
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I can't.</font>

394
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:15,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up, Professor.
You've fired all your bullets.</font>

395
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I've got
one more bullet left,</font>

396
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's a doozy.</font>

397
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger, would you like
to tell your friends</font>

398
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:26,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">why they did so poorly
on this paper,</font>

399
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">or shall I?</font>

400
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff?
- Jeff?</font>

401
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:30,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

402
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tanked my section.</font>

403
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you guys
would all work hard,</font>

404
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I just coasted.</font>

405
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Waits was...
Ah!</font>

406
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ow.
- You cost me Valedictorian.</font>

407
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">He cost me Valedictorian.
That was my punch.</font>

408
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom waits!</font>

409
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

410
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, do you have
any milk duds?</font>

411
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I know
you're in there.</font>

412
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:05,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can smell you.</font>

413
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I have the game on
too loud?</font>

414
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything okay?</font>

415
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just spending an evening</font>

416
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my two irresistible lady
friends, Rizzoli and Isles,</font>

417
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:12,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I heard...
wait a minute.</font>

418
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
is going on in here?</font>

419
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't!
- I can explain.</font>

420
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">No explanation necessary.</font>

421
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:22,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you decide to have
a party without me, Jeffrey,</font>

422
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:25,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">at least have the decency
to do it when I'm in spin class.</font>

423
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a blast
at holiday-themed parties.</font>

424
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where the hell is he?
- Professor? Did he leave?</font>

425
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:35,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why in God's name
would I leave?</font>

426
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just getting
interesting.</font>

427
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, one of you untied me.</font>

428
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder who it was.</font>

429
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:45,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is the Benedict Arnold,</font>

430
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">the true hero of this story?</font>

431
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, what's gonna happen
when we find out</font>

432
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">who betrayed us?
I wonder why you're so scared.</font>

433
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:53,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't me.</font>

434
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just say
a ghost did it again?</font>

435
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna find out who
did it when we get our grade.</font>

436
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:00,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we'll have to find out now.</font>

437
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise,
the lesson isn't complete.</font>

438
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the lesson
is complete, Professor.</font>

439
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you taught us
tonight?</font>

440
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, yes, empires fall,</font>

441
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're no empire.</font>

442
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just a bunch
of flawed, selfish people.</font>

443
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's not our weakness.</font>

444
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's our strength.</font>

445
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one thing
that we can count on</font>

446
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">at any given moment
is that the six of us</font>

447
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">are paying for a mistake
made by one of us.</font>

448
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:22,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that means,
at any given moment,</font>

449
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of us is screwing up
so badly,</font>

450
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he or she is gonna forgive
whoever screws up next.</font>

451
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm gonna do something
that Octavian never would...</font>

452
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:32,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">yeah, I read the book.</font>

453
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna say that
whoever untied the Professor...</font>

454
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a crap.</font>

455
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:37,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because whoever it was,</font>

456
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:41,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it was
some flawed, selfish, weak,</font>

457
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">hopeless soul like me.</font>

458
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly what the betrayer
would say.</font>

459
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:52,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, dick, if it was me,</font>

460
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna lose my "a"
by tying you up again.</font>

461
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

462
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get over here.</font>

463
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's hurting.
That's hurting.</font>

464
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:05,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you'll excuse us,</font>

465
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have some gifts to open.</font>

466
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, mine first, mine first.</font>

467
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milady.</font>

468
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, Kevin, did you wrap
these presents yourself?</font>

469
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once again, I'm not a dog.</font>

470
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoink.</font>

471
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doink.</font>

472
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kevin, how do you tie a knot?</font>

473
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really simple.</font>

474
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you go...</font>

475
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:33,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a little rabbit ear
like so,</font>

476
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">then the kids go marching
down the well.</font>

477
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... My... God.</font>

478
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor,
you were never tied up.</font>

479
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

480
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:43,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to say?</font>

481
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:48,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to say?</font>

482
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I did it
because I'm lonely?</font>

483
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">That my daughter isn't in town?</font>

484
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">That she never comes to see me</font>

485
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she finds me
too manipulative?</font>

486
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you could say you're sorry
for the whole thing.</font>

487
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I suppose
that would be accurate.</font>

488
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that, as compensation
for the mental anguish</font>

489
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">you caused us,
you'll give us an "a."</font>

490
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.
Overreaching?</font>

491
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:13,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough. Maybe you
can grade us separately.</font>

492
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way, Shirley and Annie
can get their "a" s.</font>

493
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Jeffrey,
he can give us an "f"</font>

494
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:19,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you can give us an "a,"</font>

495
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we should all get
the same grade.</font>

496
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">God's sake, don't rub it in.</font>

497
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.
Seeing as you saved me</font>

498
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:31,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">from my yearly Christmas
tradition of plum pudding,</font>

499
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:34,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">roasted goose,
and updating my suicide note...</font>

500
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose I could give you
a "c."</font>

501
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Uh.</font>

502
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:43,518

503
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,738

00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:06,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
That's really great.</font>

- By the way,</font>

519
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:18,953

520
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">so my gift to you all</font>

521
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,507

for the next year.</font>

522
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, stupid, a gift
doesn't create an obligation.</font>

523
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the obligation
that's a gift.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they're not expelled.</font>

528
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to do something else.</font>

529
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how could I have stayed mad
at you, guys?</font>

530
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:54,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, I was gonna save these
for the real Christmas day,</font>

were getting antsy.</font>

00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these two guys are Jeffrey.</font>

539
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">At nice times like this,</font>

540
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:13,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder what's happening
in the darkest timeline.</font>

541
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timeline?</font>

542
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:18,119

no dark timelines.</font>

I may not have a right arm,</font>

544
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:27,496

with what's right.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">My client miss Edison did rob
several drug stores,</font>

546

<font color="#FFFFFF">and, yes, she did stab
several pharmacists,</font>

547
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">but let's talk
about the bigger crime,</font>

548
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:41,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">that someone so beautiful
has been removed from society.</font>

549

you are hereby released</font>

552

you were even younger.</font>
