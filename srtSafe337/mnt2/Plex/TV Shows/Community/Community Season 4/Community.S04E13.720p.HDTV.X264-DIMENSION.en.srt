00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Get out of my chair,
or I'll have you disbarred.</font>

2
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait.
That already happened.</font>

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cash.
- Tango.</font>

4
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">My old partner in my new firm.</font>

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it get any better?</font>

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not unless you leave.</font>

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still got it.</font>

8
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:20,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a little birdie told me</font>

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're graduating
kiddie college.</font>

10
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:24,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be excited
to get that lollipop.</font>

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.
It's a sticker.</font>

12
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:27,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha.</font>

13
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:30,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're busy, not,
so allow me to whip it out.</font>

14
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come work with me.</font>

15
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be a full partner,
six figures,</font>

16
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">corner office,
three secretaries.</font>

17
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?
Not enough money?</font>

18
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll double it.
Bam, done.</font>

19
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how we negotiate.
Lunch?</font>

20
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
I drive a hard bargain.</font>

21
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, mark, aren't you worried
I'm a little out of practice?</font>

22
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:46,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only cases I've tried lately
are about sandwiches and yams.</font>

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, you were
a better lawyer</font>

24
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you weren't a lawyer</font>

25
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">than most lawyers I know.</font>

26
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still in you.</font>

27
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give it some thought.</font>

28
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just shake my hand, idiot.
It's simple.</font>

29
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like simple.</font>

30
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look around, Winger.</font>

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your new old life.</font>

32
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just had Christmas,
and now it's warm outside.</font>

34
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:09,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it is, dummy.</font>

35
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:10,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just finished
fall-spring semester.</font>

36
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:12,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring on summer-winter.</font>

37
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait.</font>

38
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">My final film school class
is just called opinions.</font>

39
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Taylor
is scheduled to teach,</font>

40
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have a rebuttal.</font>

41
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky.</font>

42
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I transferred to forensics late
and got the worst classes.</font>

43
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:23,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Skull fragment collection,
advanced advanced decomp,</font>

44
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">and intro to senselessness
were all full.</font>

45
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still have a year
of A/C repair left.</font>

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I passed all my classes,</font>

47
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">so now I just do yoga</font>

48
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">while the teachers
write down my wisdoms.</font>

49
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.
Jeff passed history.</font>

50
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's graduating early.</font>

51
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm totally unprepared
to deal with this.</font>

52
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Annie,
please, don't—</font>

53
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's official.
It's on a banner.</font>

54
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, Jeffrey.</font>

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worked hard
not to work hard</font>

56
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">to earn that degree.</font>

57
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you took
so many blow-off classes</font>

58
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pointless electives.</font>

59
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you end up
majoring in?</font>

60
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Education.</font>

61
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had to win, didn't you?</font>

62
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was inches
from the finish line.</font>

63
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you have
so many credits,</font>

64
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:55,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">they have grand-credits.</font>

65
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just graduate already.</font>

66
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's the graduation ceremony?</font>

67
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.
It's community college.</font>

68
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just send in some papers
and they stop charging you.</font>

69
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's moving, in its own way.</font>

70
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:06,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is it?</font>

71
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">A banner and some soda
Troy forgot to bring?</font>

72
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

73
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as graduations go,
it's boring but grounded.</font>

74
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping for more.</font>

75
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:13,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we at least walk with you
to the Dean's office?</font>

76
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, now?
No.</font>

77
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just—I was going
to mail it in next week,</font>

78
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">or, you know, whenever.</font>

79
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be silly.</font>

80
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">We started as a study group,</font>

81
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll finish as a study group.</font>

82
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">All for one, and one dude
we can all leave behind.</font>

83
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:24,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, go quickly.</font>

84
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

85
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Hey.</font>

86
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:29,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Give me some rope</font>

87
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ tie me to dream</font>

88
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ give me the hope</font>

89
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ to run out of steam</font>

90
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Somebody said it can be here ♪</font>

91
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ we could be roped up</font>

92
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ tied up, dead in a year ♪</font>

93
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:47,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪</font>

Et al. Britta.</font>

96
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emotions are running high,</font>

97
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I will keep this
tight and short.</font>

98
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always do.</font>

99
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you have
all the necessary paperwork.</font>

100
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Necessary?
You asked for proof of inseam.</font>

101
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, Jeffrey.</font>

102
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:11,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to miss our playful,
"Get a room already" banter.</font>

103
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Dean.
- I can come back.</font>

104
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can do this.</font>

105
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:16,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just need to sign
the old John Dean-cock</font>

106
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:20,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will be graduated.</font>

107
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is it?</font>

108
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.</font>

109
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh—I expected
a little more pageantry.</font>

110
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm listening.</font>

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's right.</font>

112
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should throw a party
to mark the occasion.</font>

113
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">A small one.</font>

114
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:35,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The teensiest.</font>

115
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just close friends,
a small cake—</font>

116
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:39,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe some flowers,
an archway—</font>

117
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">A string quartet.</font>

118
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, he could wear a suit.</font>

119
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:42,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting to sound
like a wedding.</font>

120
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a wedding.</font>

121
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just your average,
low-key diploma signing,</font>

122
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">to which you're all
cordially invited,</font>

123
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">tomorrow afternoon.</font>

124
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow?</font>

125
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that enough time
to plan a whole wedding?</font>

126
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Absolutely.
- I'll get my book.</font>

127
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I can't do a big party.</font>

128
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too much.</font>

129
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see what's going on here.</font>

130
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about you getting
cold feet about graduating.</font>

131
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pshh, yeah.</font>

132
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been looking forward
to graduation</font>

133
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">since freshman registration.</font>

134
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already got a job lined up</font>

135
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">at my old partner's firm.</font>

136
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, let them eat cake.</font>

137
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, I'm worried
that the group might not be able</font>

138
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">to handle it,
you know, emotionally.</font>

139
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:19,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone wants you
to graduate, Jeff.</font>

140
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what about Abed?</font>

141
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the stress of me leaving
might send him spiraling.</font>

142
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
give him some more credit.</font>

143
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's really progressed since
he opened up to my therapizing.</font>

144
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember last year,
when he wouldn't stop</font>

145
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about that
"darkest timeline" thing?</font>

146
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one where I lost my arm?</font>

147
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Pierce died,
and Annie went insane,</font>

148
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he blamed it all
on you throwing some dice.</font>

149
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has not brought that up
in months.</font>

150
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, Britta.</font>

151
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need
to give Abed a chance.</font>

152
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's settled.</font>

153
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">The six of us will
take astronomy next semester.</font>

154
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now you're leaving me out.</font>

155
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're leaving Jeff out.</font>

156
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm not even the one
who gets left out anymore.</font>

157
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's
Jeff, Jeff—</font>

158
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

159
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">This seat taken?</font>

160
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">So everyone still excited
about the big shindig?</font>

161
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

162
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was worried about
the wedding-graduation mash up,</font>

163
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's testing really well
with women.</font>

164
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, that's a load off.</font>

165
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we should probably
figure out</font>

166
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's bringing the soda now,
right?</font>

167
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so there's not
another hang up.</font>

168
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought it.
I-I just drank it all.</font>

169
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
I've got it covered.</font>

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
You've already done so much.</font>

171
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, I think I have
a fun and fair way</font>

172
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:23,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">to decide which of the six of us
will bring the soda.</font>

173
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll roll for it.</font>

174
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't land on a number.</font>

175
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">That probably means nothing.</font>

176
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or it means everything.
- Let's hope not.</font>

177
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what,
I'll bring the soda.</font>

178
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, I'll make sure
there aren't any more hang-ups.</font>

179
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must I bear this cross forever?</font>

180
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping for more.</font>

What's going on?</font>

192
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you trying

<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I knew.</font>

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,334

don't take the job.</font>

201
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at graduation.</font>

202
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they call us the worst.</font>

203
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took you long enough.</font>

204
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, nobody said you had

205
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
You brought the good one.</font>

206
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hold that,
I'll do the sleeve.</font>

Good.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Middle finger works great now.</font>

210
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worse than I thought.</font>

211
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">They made lame Jeff
too lame to leave Greendale.</font>

212
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got to take that job.</font>

213
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how do we make him do that?</font>

214
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">By turning the study group
against him</font>

215
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:16,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he'll run screaming
from this rancid cocoon</font>

216
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">into the welcoming arms
of darkness.</font>

217
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">How hard is that to understand?</font>

218
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not.</font>

219
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just like when you
talk down to me like a child.</font>

220
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:29,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Jeff.</font>

221
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:30,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad luck
to see the graduation</font>

222
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the graduation.</font>

223
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to talk to you.</font>

224
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today is bringing up
so many emotions.</font>

225
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:37,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot to take in.</font>

226
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not making you feel nervous</font>

227
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">about graduating, am I?</font>

228
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are making me
feel something.</font>

229
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's not about graduating.</font>

230
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying I'm hot for you.</font>

231
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?</font>

232
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:51,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this for real?</font>

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my beating heart for real?</font>

234
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:54,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie.</font>

235
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if it's
the beautiful decorations,</font>

236
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the impending
floral archway,</font>

237
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:03,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's something about this
that feels so right.</font>

238
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the perfect moment
to remember you by.</font>

239
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember me by?</font>

240
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

241
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:11,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.
You're going nowhere.</font>

242
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm about to return
to my cool, adult, lawyer life,</font>

243
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're going to be
stuck here, playing high school.</font>

244
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you saying this?</font>

245
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you face the facts.</font>

246
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I graduate, I'm gone.</font>

247
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger, streaking
on your last day of school?</font>

248
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Respect.</font>

249
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so I got the save the date
for your graduation.</font>

250
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I bring a date,
or try to hook up there?</font>

251
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to your
stupid graduation, jerk.</font>

252
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you said
those things to me.</font>

253
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What things?
- Don't play dumb.</font>

254
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to leave?
Leave.</font>

255
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:43,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">See if I care.</font>

256
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?</font>

257
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:48,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no earthly idea.</font>

258
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:51,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look up there.</font>

259
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, Abed.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.</font>

260
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:57,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
How did you—</font>

261
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may not be good
with facial expressions,</font>

262
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I know an evil doppelganger
when I see one.</font>

263
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus your arm makes a noise
every time you move it.</font>

264
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence.</font>

265
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you here to kill Jeff?</font>

266
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you non-evils
are so naive.</font>

267
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:08,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to save Jeff</font>

268
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the smothering teat
of his study group.</font>

269
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a paintball gun?</font>

270
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:17,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wish.</font>

271
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

272
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
Cold.</font>

273
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did I get
to the Dean's office?</font>

274
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

275
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:37,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of my chair, monkey.</font>

276
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">The darkest timeline.</font>

277
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,426

278
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, okay,
let's start with "Huh?"</font>

279
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I'm sorry.
I made it all up.</font>

280
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been so upset
about you graduating</font>

281
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I've gone
a little crazy, emotionally.</font>

282
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good.
I thought I was losing my mind.</font>

283
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it up to you with a hug?</font>

284
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">This breakfast sandwich cart
is such a great idea.</font>

285
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never too early
for Shirley—</font>

286
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make a boatload off
of hung over college kids.</font>

287
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of great idea having,
hear me out.</font>

288
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:20,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called
"The Troy-jan Horse."</font>

289
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:24,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">It goes bread, lettuce, ham,
ham, bacon, chocolate—</font>

290
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how you doing,
the graduate?</font>

291
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stopping by
to hand out some un-vites</font>

292
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">to my graduation.</font>

293
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's one
for the desperate housewife</font>

294
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">who spends more time
with her pathetic business</font>

295
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:35,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">than with her family.</font>

296
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you.</font>

297
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you call a sandwich
a "Troy-jan Horse,"</font>

298
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">people are going
to think there's horse in it.</font>

299
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my dreams.</font>

300
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever, losers.
See you never.</font>

301
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Abed?</font>

302
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anyone here?</font>

303
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Abed.
Welcome to our home.</font>

304
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, Evil Abed.
- It's just Abed now.</font>

305
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we met,
I abandoned my evil goal</font>

306
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">to focus on brightening
my own timeline instead.</font>

307
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you live here alone?
- Yes.</font>

308
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evil Troy moved out
when I gave up the cause.</font>

309
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he only listens
to Evil Jeff,</font>

310
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">who sort of took over this year,
villain-wise.</font>

311
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff left Greendale and
became a scummy lawyer again,</font>

312
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the more evil he got,</font>

313
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more he became tortured
by the idea</font>

314
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">that there's still
a good Jeff out there,</font>

315
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">being good somewhere.</font>

316
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why he forced me
to show him</font>

317
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to travel
between timelines.</font>

318
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:19,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God.
This is so cool.</font>

319
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
You have no idea</font>

320
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">how long I've been waiting
to talk to you about it.</font>

321
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of a <i>Superman III</i>
meets that <i>Star Trek</i> episode</font>

322
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">meets season three of <i>The Cape</i>.</font>

323
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>The Cape</i> was cancelled.
- Not here.</font>

324
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">They retooled it for cable,
and it's awesome.</font>

325
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to see it?</font>

326
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Desperately.</font>

327
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:33,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I need to get back
to my timeline</font>

328
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stop Evil Jeff.</font>

329
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I came to the only person
who could help me—me.</font>

330
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you home, Abed.</font>

331
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first,
you'll need some supplies.</font>

332
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone must be running late.</font>

333
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:50,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Jeffrey.
You're graduated.</font>

334
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your precious diploma
and just go.</font>

335
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot believe
the hurtful things</font>

336
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">you said to me in my office.</font>

337
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have you know</font>

338
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">that wanting a little pageantry
in your life</font>

339
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:02,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't a crime
or a lifestyle choice.</font>

340
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:10,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Annie, something
definitely weird is happening.</font>

341
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's here,
the Dean is mad at me,</font>

342
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he is never
mad at me, and—</font>

343
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">a third reason.</font>

344
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, Jeff.</font>

345
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry
about the study group.</font>

346
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can talk to them later.</font>

347
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you and I
go celebrate</font>

348
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">someplace private and boozy?</font>

349
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, why are you acting
like a mistress</font>

350
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a lifetime movie?</font>

351
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're funny.</font>

352
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sweetheart,
you dropped your phone earlier.</font>

353
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a voicemail
from a guy named mark?</font>

354
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should call him.</font>

355
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now.</font>

356
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to find the others
and figure this out.</font>

357
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap.
We're losing him.</font>

358
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What?</font>

359
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:42,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

360
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're me?</font>

361
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But how?
- But how?</font>

362
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of the pleasantries.</font>

363
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:48,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come
from the darkest timeline</font>

364
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make sure you take that job.</font>

365
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's essential to our future.</font>

366
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want it, idiot, so take it.</font>

367
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

368
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent
almost four years here,</font>

369
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">growing and changing
and making dioramas.</font>

370
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not that guy anymore.</font>

371
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:01,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong.</font>

372
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:04,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale may have dulled
your killer instinct,</font>

373
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">but trust me,
it's still in you.</font>

374
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:10,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to leave this place
and reclaim your proper life.</font>

375
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:13,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Not without my study group.</font>

376
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.
Now who's in a lifetime movie?</font>

377
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'll be rid of you
another way.</font>

378
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:27,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friendship!</font>

379
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.
Cold.</font>

380
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the subtle approach
failed.</font>

381
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's next?
Explain it slowly.</font>

382
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need some help?</font>

383
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's burn this mother down.</font>

384
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff must be graduating about now.
I wonder if anyone's there.</font>

385
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doubt he cares.</font>

386
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce won't even
respond to my texts.</font>

387
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder what terrible things
Jeff said about him.</font>

388
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got some guesses.</font>

389
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me finish.</font>

390
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know this may
sound crazy,</font>

391
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">and more
than a little convenient,</font>

392
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">but whatever I said to you,
it wasn't me.</font>

393
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Evil Jeff.</font>

394
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

395
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something happened
when I rolled that die.</font>

396
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:11,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something terrible.</font>

397
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something only nerds
can understand.</font>

398
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to believe me.</font>

400
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming for us.</font>

401
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

402
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're coming for them.</font>

403
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:20,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, where have you been?</font>

404
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:21,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The darkest timeline.</font>

405
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:22,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys never believe me,
so this time,</font>

406
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought proof,
the doppeldeaner.</font>

407
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed brought me here
to prove to all of you—</font>

408
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

409
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I figured that
these paintball warping guns</font>

410
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:32,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">would convince you.</font>

411
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up, people.</font>

412
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got an inter-dimensional
battle on our hands.</font>

413
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our evil counterparts
are waging a war,</font>

414
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's either us or us.</font>

415
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

416
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's light up
these dark suckers.</font>

417
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:44,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everyone.
Stay sharp.</font>

418
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you see yourself,
warp on sight.</font>

419
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to warp myself
to a dairy-free mudslide.</font>

420
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just vodka, Shirley.</font>

421
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:52,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what it is.</font>

422
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah-ha.</font>

423
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:55,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

424
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought you were dead.</font>

425
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, no.</font>

426
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">After I got shot,
I faked my death</font>

427
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">to teach you all a lesson.</font>

428
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lesson about what?</font>

429
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who can remember?
It was more than a year ago.</font>

430
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet, here you all are,</font>

431
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">planning an invasion
without me.</font>

432
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again,
we thought you were dead.</font>

433
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I-I can help you guys
beat the lame study group.</font>

434
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell me how this works.</font>

435
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

436
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's complicated,
but basically,</font>

437
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first person
to shoot themselves wins.</font>

438
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winner.</font>

439
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that bow tied itself.</font>

440
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dang, I got hair dye
on my coat.</font>

441
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dang, it's spreading.</font>

442
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:28,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Britta.</font>

443
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you shoot yourself too?</font>

444
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time.</font>

445
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

446
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:34,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk to her like that.</font>

447
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time.</font>

448
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here.
Scatter.</font>

449
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get help.</font>

450
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't hide forever, lame Annie.</font>

451
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let me shoot you.</font>

452
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll love
the darkest timeline.</font>

453
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sleeping with Jeff there.</font>

454
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
We are?</font>

455
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the time.</font>

456
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he loves it.</font>

457
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody sleeps with Jeff.</font>

458
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even me.</font>

459
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been counting bullets.</font>

460
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us is out.</font>

461
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it you?
- Yes.</font>

462
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you tell me that?</font>

463
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">To sound intimidating.</font>

464
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:27,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Almost worked.</font>

465
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ballin'.</font>

466
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Only Evil Jeff is left.</font>

467
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to take him out.</font>

468
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't I just give him
what he wants?</font>

469
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
You can't give up now.</font>

470
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Because it's not real.</font>

471
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around, Jeff.</font>

472
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you noticed
the vending machines</font>

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">are full of meats
and hard-boiled eggs?</font>

474
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or that
all the background students</font>

475
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">are attractive women?</font>

476
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

477
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

478
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a world you've created
in your own mind.</font>

479
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real battle is within.</font>

480
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid to graduate
because you think</font>

481
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale has
changed you too much.</font>

482
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">So part of you
wants Evil Jeff to win,</font>

483
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">because then you could
go backwards</font>

484
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pretend you're the same guy
you were four years ago.</font>

485
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not.
You're stronger.</font>

486
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're better.
You have friends.</font>

487
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, screw that.
You have a family.</font>

488
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

489
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:12,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is all in my mind,</font>

490
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I don't really need
to fight him.</font>

491
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't logic this one
away from me.</font>

492
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We finally figured out a way
to make paintball cool again.</font>

493
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, handsome.</font>

494
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">On second thought,</font>

495
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">who needs to roll a die?</font>

496
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who cares if we have soda?</font>

497
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as you guys
are with me,</font>

498
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have everything I need
to graduate.</font>

499
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Forget soda.</font>

500
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:04,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends, Greendalians,
human beings,</font>

501
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are gathered here today
to honor</font>

502
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:10,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">that sacred and eternal bond
between a student and his Dean.</font>

503
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither time nor distance
nor screening one's calls</font>

504
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:17,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">could ever sever what
nature herself has ordained.</font>

505
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">When two men are drawn—</font>

506
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take it from here, Craig.</font>

507
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:23,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough.
I was reaching.</font>

508
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three and a half years ago,
when I came to Greendale,</font>

509
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met six
very important people.</font>

510
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.
Burn on Britta.</font>

511
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, seven.</font>

512
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">And meeting these people
changed my life.</font>

513
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

514
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.</font>

515
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, okay.
- Whatever.</font>

516
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so used to being the guy</font>

517
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">who can talk his way
out of anything,</font>

518
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:51,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what do you say
when you don't want a way out?</font>

519
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:56,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you all have done
for me is indescribable.</font>

520
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unbelievable.</font>

521
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:02,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my love for you
is immeasurable,</font>

522
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:06,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">even when you split it
seven ways.</font>

523
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:09,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well said, Jeffrey.</font>

524
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:12,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone here
should have just cause</font>

525
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">why Jeffrey Tobias Winger
should not be graduated,</font>

526
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">speak now
or forever—</font>

527
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.</font>

528
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.</font>

529
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready to graduate.</font>

530
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

531
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:24,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm ready
to graduate first.</font>

532
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems oddly appropriate.</font>

533
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, Pierce.</font>

534
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

535
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's next
for Jeffrey Winger?</font>

536
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thinking I might look
into some small local firms.</font>

537
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to use my big mouth
to help the little guy.</font>

538
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

539
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, if I stay in town,</font>

540
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can pop by any time I want.</font>

541
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, just to settle
any group arguments</font>

542
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">about who misses me the most.</font>

543
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh—</font>

544
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

545
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To Jeff.
- To Jeffrey.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Troy and Abed in the morning ♪</font>

547
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:05,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome back.</font>

548
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a jam-packed show,
so let's get started.</font>

549
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:08,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, as always,</font>

550
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:09,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll be visited once again</font>

551
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">by Greendale's king
and supreme lord master,</font>

552
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Chang.</font>

553
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like he'll be
talking about squash this time.</font>

554
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm super excited for that.</font>

555
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not only
because it's mandatory.</font>

556
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, we'll take a spin
around the timeline map</font>

557
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">and find out what's happening
in the universes</font>

558
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">that parallel ours.</font>

559
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, us.</font>

560
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm standing here
in timeline five,</font>

561
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:28,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">where things
are pretty much normal.</font>

562
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Normal?</font>

563
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, people are on fire
in Nairobi.</font>

564
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You call that normal?</font>

565
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've become much more conscious
of world issues</font>

566
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">since Troy and I decided to give
our baby an African name.</font>

567
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that right, Chewbacca?</font>

568
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means,
"He who hunts bounties."</font>

569
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to you.</font>

570
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, it sounds like things are
really heating up in Nairobi.</font>

571
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nothing compared
to the fire</font>

572
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">in our studio audience.</font>

573
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, idiots.</font>

574
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:54,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times have I told you,</font>

575
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">the show doesn't really exist.</font>

576
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's watching.</font>

577
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh-doy.
We know.</font>

578
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're just
messing around.</font>

579
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at lunch, Evil Jeff.</font>

580
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,473
