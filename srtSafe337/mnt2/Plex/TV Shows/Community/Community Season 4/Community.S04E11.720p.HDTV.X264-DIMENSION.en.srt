00:00:02,511 --> 00:00:04,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, I got class
in 15 minutes.</font>

2
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">This should not be
that difficult.</font>

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:06,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need
to figure out an idea</font>

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:08,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">for our final history project.</font>

5
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:09,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we need to figure out</font>

6
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">is Greendale's obsession
with group assignments.</font>

7
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Classic herd mentality.</font>

8
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Britta
doesn't have one. Who else?</font>

9
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:19,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.</font>

10
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:20,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope, not an idea.
That's a statement.</font>

11
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone not on medication?</font>

12
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we have
to take this seriously.</font>

13
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">This assignment?
This, we have to take seriously?</font>

14
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pick any moment from history
and tell me about it.</font>

15
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Be as creative as you want.
Or not. I don't care.</font>

16
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:32,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Cornwaaa—"</font>

17
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't even finish
signing his name.</font>

18
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yes,
he phoned this one in,</font>

19
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:38,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my run at Valedictorian
is in jeopardy.</font>

20
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As is mine.
- As is Shirley's,</font>

21
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:42,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just took one
for the team</font>

22
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">by accepting that C-plus
on our last history paper.</font>

23
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As did I.
- As did Shirley.</font>

24
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'd think you'd want
to rise to the occasion</font>

25
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:49,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and help get me back on top.
- Or me.</font>

26
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I'm speaking
for both you and me.</font>

27
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, you might want
to teach your mouth</font>

28
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to say "we,"our,"
and "us."</font>

29
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.</font>

30
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope, still
just a random statement,</font>

31
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:02,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">and still useless.</font>

32
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:04,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
How about this?</font>

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We do a series of banners—
- Great, it's settled.</font>

34
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even know
what I'm going to say!</font>

35
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't need to.
Tomorrow is Friday,</font>

36
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:10,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have no intention
of being here late.</font>

37
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your banner thing
sounds doable,</font>

38
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this assignment?
Passable, so passable.</font>

39
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:17,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">And passable
assures my graduation,</font>

40
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we are doing doable
and passable.</font>

41
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:23,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, speaking of tomorrow,
Troy and Britta,</font>

42
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:24,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">have you decided
what you're gonna do</font>

43
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your
one-year anniversary?</font>

44
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:28,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of?</font>

45
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your first date?</font>

46
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:31,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Da-doy.</font>

47
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:33,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
That was a test,</font>

48
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and you failed.
- I was just kidding.</font>

49
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are dating?
Man!</font>

50
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:39,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's sure working her way
around the table.</font>

51
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:40,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you?</font>

52
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:42,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you should really
do something special,</font>

53
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- something romantic.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

54
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:47,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like go back to Senor Kevin's
for lunch, where it all began.</font>

55
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:49,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sure.</font>

56
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:50,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could do that.</font>

57
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:53,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, that sounds fun.</font>

58
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of anniversaries,</font>

59
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:56,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is the third anniversary
of me and Abed</font>

60
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">watching <i>Freaky Friday</i>
for the first time.</font>

61
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...
That, you remember?</font>

62
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:03,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Movie Trolley is having</font>

63
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:04,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">an "End of the Video Store
Chain Industry" sale,</font>

64
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:06,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I got you a six-pack
of "body switching" movies</font>

65
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a two-year-old box
of Raisinets,</font>

66
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- all for under five bucks.
- Whoo!</font>

67
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, man.
<i>Change Up.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

72
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,996
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Freaky Friday.</i></font>

73
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Troy,
you are so thoughtful.</font>

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had the capacity
for sentimentality like you do.</font>

75
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:31,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?
I wish I was more like you.</font>

76
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">No emotional hang-ups,
endless cool adventures.</font>

77
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have it so easy.</font>

78
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you do, Troy.</font>

79
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:38,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you do, Abed.</font>

80
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could
switch places with you</font>

81
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">for just one day!</font>

82
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah!
- Oh.</font>

83
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:57,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
Routine light switch check.</font>

84
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:00,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

85
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that would work.</font>

86
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're all floored
it didn't.</font>

it was awkward yesterday.</font>

and we didn't remember,</font>

out of it, right?</font>

00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm looking forward to it.</font>

I'm just saying...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

109
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:04,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same page.</font>

00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

111
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy, wake up!</font>

112
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember yesterday, when we
faked a body switching thing</font>

113
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:14,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it didn't work?</font>

114

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now,
it's actually worked.</font>

115

<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, right now—
- I'm you and you're me.</font>

117
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,822

And of all the days!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Decoupage and glitter,
a-a-and...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">this is the approval station,</font>

to start over or not.</font>

133

We're doing doable and passable.</font>

to help us...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- ... beat Leonard.</font>

136
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Leonard is now</font>

137
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:14,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">the front runner
for Valedictorian?</font>

138

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're getting beat by Leonard?</font>

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's so old.
- All right.</font>

140
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we slipped below Leonard,</font>

141
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Annie and I are a close
three and two, respectively.</font>

142
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie is the three.</font>

143
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,865

suggests.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

145
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,259

- Mm-hmm.</font>

146
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:41,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! That was weird.</font>

147
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.</font>

148
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't mean to do that.
We know exactly where we sit.</font>

149
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:48,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, what's going on
with you guys?</font>

150
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God,
you noticed.</font>

151
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when we pretended
to switch bodies yesterday?</font>

152
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:54,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, yes, dorks.</font>

153
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it really happened.
I'm actually Abed.</font>

154
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I'm actually Troy.
- All right.</font>

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care who's who.</font>

156
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:02,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all here,
and that's all I need</font>

157
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:04,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">to complete
this passable project</font>

158
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a doable amount of time.</font>

159
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:07,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wish we could help, Jeff,</font>

160
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:08,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in order to switch back,
we have to recreate</font>

161
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:09,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">the exact moment
that all this happened,</font>

162
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but the DVD is missing.
- Of course it is.</font>

163
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now, I have to find it</font>

164
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">while Troy goes on
an anniversary date with Britta.</font>

165
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

166
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey.</font>

167
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:17,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a fun sci-fi thing.</font>

168
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you make a banner
as Troy</font>

169
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you make a banner as Abed,</font>

170
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll be done
within the hour.</font>

171
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:24,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.</font>

172
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's
if we want an "A."</font>

173
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you two need
to let go of the pressure</font>

174
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're putting on this project
to get an "A."</font>

175
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserve
to be number one!</font>

176
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:33,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Or me!</font>

177
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

178
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:39,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have to go talk to Troy.
- Yes, please.</font>

179
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your boyfriend
and his boyfriend</font>

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">that playtime is over.</font>

181
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:45,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, Shirley, go find out
what's keeping Leonard on top.</font>

182
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Abed won't switch back
until we get that DVD.</font>

183
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll deal with that.</font>

184
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then,
we are meeting back here</font>

185
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">and getting up
into some puffy paint</font>

186
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">and doing our doable,
passable banners!</font>

187
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:54,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to do?</font>

188
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay alive.</font>

189
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:57,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or don't.</font>

190
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on it.</font>

191
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:00,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Troy!</font>

192
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:01,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Abed.</font>

193
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right.</font>

194
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, "Troy,"
could you please excuse us?</font>

195
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:09,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were weird this morning,
and now, well, weirder.</font>

196
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we still on
for Senor Kevin's</font>

197
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:13,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are you guys doing
this whole switchy thing?</font>

198
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, he's kind of
going through some stuff.</font>

199
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Is he having some issues</font>

200
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he's having trouble
dealing with?</font>

201
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:22,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he kind of needs this,
so he's really laying into it.</font>

202
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:27,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so he might need
an almost therapist.</font>

203
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I'll pencil him in
for a session,</font>

204
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:33,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know,
after my date with Troy.</font>

205
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:37,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later, Abed.</font>

206
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I need you.</font>

207
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening.
Shut the door.</font>

208
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Hmm?</font>

209
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:46,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, I need you to give
this DVD to Troy and Abed.</font>

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love those movies!</font>

211
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should make more of them.
They're a timeless tale.</font>

212
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you give it to them?</font>

213
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed think
they switched bodies</font>

214
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">while holding
onto a <i>freaky Friday</i> DVD,</font>

215
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:59,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">which, of course,
is now mysteriously missing,</font>

216
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they can't switch back
until they find it.</font>

217
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'd give them
this one myself,</font>

218
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they'll think
that I bought it, which I did.</font>

219
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:08,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
How did they switch bodies?</font>

220
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they held
onto the DVD and said...</font>

221
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:12,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could
switch places with you</font>

222
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:13,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">for just one day.</font>

223
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:15,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh!</font>

224
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... Ah!</font>

225
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:20,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
Routine light switch check.</font>

226
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not a thing!</font>

227
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

228
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:27,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you've got to be kidding me.</font>

229
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm you?</font>

230
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
No! You're not.</font>

231
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
It's fricking Friday.</font>

232
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no justification
to be made,</font>

233
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it can't happen,
weirdo.</font>

234
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:42,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever, Dean.
Now, please leave <i>your</i> office</font>

235
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can start
to work on <i>your</i> weird body</font>

236
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'm now stuck in!</font>

237
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not even
holding a phone!</font>

238
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Troy...</font>

239
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">how's Abed coping?</font>

240
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, with his day in your body?</font>

241
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:01,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have to ask him.
I, for one, am freaked.</font>

242
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at his arms and legs.</font>

243
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like the pick-up sticks
of people.</font>

244
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he's trying
to hide from something</font>

245
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:08,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's not understanding?</font>

246
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're worried about Abed,
you should talk to him.</font>

247
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:13,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.
I should talk to <i>him.</i></font>

248
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well.
John "Mc-Lame."</font>

249
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never thought
I'd see your face again.</font>

250
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back for more, huh?</font>

251
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, back for what?</font>

252
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:23,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punishment.</font>

253
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:24,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time I saw you,</font>

254
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got your panties
all in a wad</font>

255
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:29,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I said <i>Die Hard</i>
was a suckfest of a movie.</font>

256
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?
You hate <i>Die Hard?</i></font>

257
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds insane to me.</font>

258
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:35,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is, without a doubt,</font>

259
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:38,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most unnecessary movie
ever made.</font>

260
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:41,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not
who you think I am, man.</font>

261
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else do you hate
about the movie?</font>

262
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:47,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I would love to hear
all of your opinions.</font>

263
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:50,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean,
where to even start?</font>

264
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's riddled with plot holes.
There's no logic to it.</font>

265
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:57,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would rather watch a napkin
sit and do nothing all day</font>

266
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:01,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">than to even endure the trailer
for <i>Die Hard!</i></font>

267
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:04,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that's hatred.</font>

268
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Babe, we should order.</font>

269
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:12,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm both starving and
another word for wanting food.</font>

270
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:14,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy!</font>

271
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:16,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God,
you've come to your senses.</font>

272
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You answered to Troy.</font>

273
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:19,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in public.
I have to. I'm Abed.</font>

274
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are.</font>

275
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:25,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Abed, I found the DVD.
You can switch back now.</font>

276
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:27,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try.
That's the remake.</font>

277
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:29,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the original, the mom
and daughter simply exclaimed,</font>

278
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I wish I could switch places
with you for just one day,"</font>

279
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:31,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">like we did.</font>

280
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">In that one,
there's a magic fortune cookie.</font>

281
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I always wondered
what the differences were.</font>

282
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, why don't I pitch you
a remake of a remake,</font>

283
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">where my magic mouth
tells you drop the act</font>

284
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Abed isn't even here.</font>

285
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, you cough up the DVD</font>

286
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we go tell Abed
you're back in your own bodies,</font>

287
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can go do doable
and passable banners.</font>

288
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, that's a terrible movie.</font>

289
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:51,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second, I understand
why you're frustrated,</font>

290
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's in your nature,
but this is happening.</font>

291
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">This happened.
So, unless we find that DVD—</font>

292
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, let's go find this DVD.</font>

293
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">By all means,
let's waste more of my life.</font>

294
00:10:58,885 --> 00:10:59,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we were the last ones</font>

295
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">to leave the study room
last night.</font>

296
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one of the janitors
took it.</font>

297
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.
Let's go find that janitor.</font>

298
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you can
switch bodies with him,</font>

299
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">or maybe
with his magic mop—</font>

300
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:07,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop pitching.
It's not your thing.</font>

301
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right,
that's ridiculous,</font>

302
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">unlike what we're doing.</font>

303
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:14,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean?</font>

304
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, come in.</font>

305
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd stop what I'm doing,</font>

306
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:20,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then I'd be depriving you
of the view.</font>

307
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.
What's up?</font>

308
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:29,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, is this a bad time?</font>

309
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'm in Greendale,
stuck in the body</font>

310
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:33,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a man who could be
Gollum's shadow,</font>

311
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:36,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">so yeah,
I'd say it's half past suck.</font>

312
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.</font>

313
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Half past suck."
That's funny.</font>

314
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:42,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
That's creepy.</font>

315
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Dean.</font>

316
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're losing to Leonard
in the race of Valedictorian,</font>

317
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we were wondering
if we could take a peek</font>

318
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">at his transcripts to see
how that is even possible.</font>

319
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:52,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you serious?
- Mm.</font>

320
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean put my integrity
on the line?</font>

321
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:56,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to jeopardize
the very reputation</font>

322
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">of this school that
I've spent so long protecting?</font>

323
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:00,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.
We're sorry.</font>

324
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:03,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is what I would be
saying if I gave a crap.</font>

325
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome!</font>

326
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, here's the answer.</font>

327
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:15,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back in 1968, Leonard got an "A"
in Rotary Phone Maintenance.</font>

328
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:18,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since then, he's been taking
every other class pass/fail</font>

329
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep a perfect G.P.A.</font>

330
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:21,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what does this mean?</font>

331
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means we're taking
an old man down.</font>

332
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

333
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

334
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:32,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.</font>

335
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:34,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your bean burrito?</font>

336
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:37,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Thank you
for ordering for me.</font>

337
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you always get.</font>

338
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, you know me so well.
- I know a lot about you.</font>

339
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:43,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you grind your teeth
at night, it keeps me up.</font>

340
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know about your tattoo.
- Which one?</font>

341
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Greenpeace one
you haven't gotten yet</font>

342
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're afraid
of needles.</font>

343
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:50,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Troy tell you these things?</font>

344
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Troy.</font>

345
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it must upset Abed</font>

346
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hear all of this
relationship talk.</font>

347
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't seem to care.
- Maybe.</font>

348
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe he doesn't like
talking to you about us.</font>

349
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could see that
causing him to act out.</font>

350
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:06,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, I don't see that.</font>

351
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
he's that invested in us.</font>

352
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But he talks to you about us.
- I talk to him.</font>

353
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say
when you talk to him about us?</font>

354
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you tell him
that things are good?</font>

355
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Are they?</font>

356
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, what you think?
- Well,</font>

357
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I wonder why we didn't
remember our anniversary.</font>

358
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not everybody's Annie.
- No, but I don't know.</font>

359
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like, you know,
that would be special to us,</font>

360
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, especially
if things were good.</font>

361
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something we'd want
to celebrate.</font>

362
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we are.</font>

363
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:38,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we?</font>

364
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lord Brickell,</font>

365
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:44,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was indeed
down by the stables.</font>

366
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, man.
You ever heard of knocking?</font>

367
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:50,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, just heard it,
when I did it a second ago.</font>

368
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've seen too much!
Let's kill them!</font>

369
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand down, crazy Schmidt.</font>

370
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:56,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we're doing here
is none of their business.</font>

371
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're having murder mystery
night during the day.</font>

372
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was fine with
"None of your business."</font>

373
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking
for a <i>Freaky Friday</i> DVD.</font>

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love those movies.
They should make more of those—</font>

375
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. We left it
in study room "F" last night.</font>

376
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, everything we find goes
straight to the lost and found.</font>

377
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, show us.</font>

378
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the "Wasting My Life" tour
continues.</font>

379
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard!</font>

380
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just looked
at your transcript.</font>

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew this day would come.
I'm outta here.</font>

382
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.
My work here is done.</font>

383
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one and two again.</font>

384
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:29,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you can direct your anger
and resentment at each other.</font>

385
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congrats.</font>

386
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:33,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Classic wrap-up.
- Shut up, Leonard!</font>

387
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a picture
of your old nose!</font>

388
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was a lateral move!
- Dean!</font>

389
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:37,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean...</font>

390
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie.
- Why is this happening?</font>

391
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy—makes complete sense
at this school!</font>

392
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">FYI, one of these piles
is load-bearing,</font>

393
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:50,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, uh, yeah, watch that.</font>

394
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:52,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez.</font>

395
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be harder
than I thought.</font>

396
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">This DVD isn't gonna
find itself.</font>

397
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:59,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">And neither are we, Troy,
because it's not in here,</font>

398
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:01,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know that.</font>

399
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is dumb.</font>

400
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so committed
to this bit?</font>

401
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're really
a friend to Abed, to me,</font>

402
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you'll end it, now.</font>

403
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:13,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
I have to keep going, for Troy.</font>

404
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:15,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to dig
through all this stuff. I will.</font>

405
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it isn't your problem.</font>

406
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just glad I'm here.</font>

407
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the sweeter end
of the deal.</font>

408
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy still has to go
on his date with Britta.</font>

409
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:27,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand
this whole relationship thing</font>

410
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:31,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">or why Troy would even
want to be in one.</font>

411
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long
have you felt this way?</font>

412
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:35,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or at least,</font>

413
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">how long have you
been talking to Abed about this?</font>

414
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:43,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that long.
It's more lately, I guess.</font>

415
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's felt different,</font>

416
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">like we're working at it
too hard.</font>

417
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he doesn't think
it should be.</font>

418
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be easy,
but he says it isn't.</font>

419
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels like we're
just going through the motions.</font>

420
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:57,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's afraid
if he doesn't, it just ends.</font>

421
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what? What if they're
not friends anymore?</font>

422
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd hate that.
He'd hate himself.</font>

423
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:05,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to lose
what we had.</font>

424
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's here, at this point,
not knowing how to talk to her,</font>

425
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">not knowing how to tell her
that he wants to break up.</font>

426
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:17,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, are you
breaking up with me?</font>

427
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:20,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so?</font>

428
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Jeff. I shouldn't
have brought you down here.</font>

429
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Into an of this.</font>

430
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially for a bit.
I know you don't respect them.</font>

431
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true. They're dumb,
and I stand by that,</font>

432
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">but committing to them isn't.</font>

433
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had the courage</font>

434
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">to commit to a bit
like you, Abed,</font>

435
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:40,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">or to a relationship,
like Troy.</font>

436
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Committing is hard,</font>

437
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're all scared
of what happens</font>

438
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:47,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we find out we committed
to the wrong thing,</font>

439
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:50,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's no shame
in what Troy's done.</font>

440
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:56,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put himself out there
and he really tried,</font>

441
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that proves he cares.</font>

442
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:01,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">That said,
and as hard as it may seem,</font>

443
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:05,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">right now,
Troy needs to show he cares.</font>

444
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to put himself
out there and own how he feels.</font>

445
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:12,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">That proves he's a man.</font>

446
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

447
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't think
this is the way</font>

448
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">either of us
thought this would go.</font>

449
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't say that I did.</font>

450
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, not this, not us here.</font>

451
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:36,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can say that
whenever you guys switch back</font>

452
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">to your original bodies,
I want to thank Abed</font>

453
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">for being such a good friend
to both of us.</font>

454
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, wait.
Don't do it like this.</font>

455
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand why
you had to go high concept,</font>

456
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're scared,
but Britta deserves better.</font>

457
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, it's time.</font>

458
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish
I had my own body back!</font>

459
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry,
routine light switch check.</font>

460
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Hmm.</font>

461
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I've been meaning
to see this.</font>

462
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, the easiest part,
because it's the most obvious.</font>

463
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

464
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:32,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I proved today
that I'm not ready for this.</font>

465
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:35,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted it to work.
I did.</font>

466
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care about you so much,</font>

467
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:41,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I love being around you.</font>

468
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:44,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think I'm better
as your friend,</font>

469
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:48,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">because that I know
I can be good at.</font>

470
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:54,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm number two again,
which is what it is.</font>

471
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know, if I'm not
going to be Valedictorian,</font>

472
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:00,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm glad it will be you.
- Mm, me too.</font>

473
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean you hope it's me
if it's not you,</font>

474
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">or that you're glad it's you?</font>

475
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:06,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

476
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for everything
you did for me today.</font>

477
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I pulled you into it.</font>

478
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my problem, not yours.</font>

479
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the best way someone's
ever woken me up in my life.</font>

480
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:17,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was lunch?</font>

481
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was good.
It really was.</font>

482
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you about it later.</font>

483
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there you are.</font>

484
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got bored waiting,</font>

485
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I went ahead
and did our whole project.</font>

486
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:28,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, no offense,</font>

487
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:31,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">but banners are kind of
my specialt—oh.</font>

488
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:34,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy—makes no sense
whatsoever.</font>

489
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:38,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whole thing
took 25 minutes tops.</font>

490
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

491
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Early weekend?
Early weekend? Early weekend?</font>

492
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I need to apologize
for my behavior today.</font>

493
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I switched bodies
with Jeffrey...</font>

494
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nope.
- I thought I knew</font>

495
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:50,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">what it would be like
to have Jeffrey inside of me...</font>

496
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:52,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That did not happen.
- But as it turns out,</font>

497
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">- having Jeffrey inside of me...
- Nope again.</font>

498
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">only brought out
the worst in me.</font>

499
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is to say,
having Jeffrey inside of me...</font>

500
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one was inside of anyone!</font>

501
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">was wrong...</font>

502
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to have Jeffrey inside of me.
- Shut up!</font>

503
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm sorry.</font>

504
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:09,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you'll excuse me,</font>

505
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I scolded Leonard today,</font>

506
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">and according
to Greendale bylaws,</font>

507
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:17,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I now have to grant him
three wishes.</font>

508
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:20,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, we need to get scolded
by the Dean immediately.</font>

509
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:23,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

510
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:39,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man. Football is ***.
That is an interest I have.</font>

511
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:42,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also plumbing and air conditioning
are things I think about.</font>

512
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, what are we...
what's happening?</font>

513
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, keep rolling.
- Okay, come on.</font>

514
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Feetball's... feetball?
- Feetball?</font>

515
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:52,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did I say...
- Dorks!</font>

516
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:55,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop doing outtakes.
You switched your bodies last week.</font>

517
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I just wanna apologize...</font>

518
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:02,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my God.
Hey, Dean, walk ***, am I right?</font>

519
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:04,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, it's ***.</font>

520
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, we stopped playing outtakes.</font>

521
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

522
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:08,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we did that.</font>

523
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for including me.</font>

524
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohhh!
No, still not good.</font>
