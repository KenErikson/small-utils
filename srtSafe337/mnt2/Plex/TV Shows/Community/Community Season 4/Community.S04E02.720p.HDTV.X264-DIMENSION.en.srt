00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Andre's going as Han Solo.</font>

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!</font>

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The boys are stormtroopers</font>

4
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:07,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">and little baby Ben is an ewok.</font>

5
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:08,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Oh!</font>

6
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw, you don't have enough children.</font>

7
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Happy Halloween parties, everyone.</font>

8
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all look great...
ham.</font>

9
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pig.
Let me guess.</font>

10
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:17,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a flimsy excuse to be shirtless,</font>

11
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">wearing silk underwear.</font>

12
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you are as wrong
as you are welcome.</font>

13
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this year, I planned
a two-person costume with Annie.</font>

14
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:25,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going as my ring girl.</font>

15
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:31,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pretty freaky-deaky, huh?</font>

16
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie, no. I meant
the boxing match ring girl.</font>

17
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the sexy ones
that hold the round numbers.</font>

18
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, see?</font>

19
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why we can't
just text about it, Jeff.</font>

20
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:41,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't watch sports.</font>

21
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But there's no boxer in the ring.</font>

22
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:44,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, well, I don't watch
scary movies.</font>

23
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:46,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And that's why we leave
the couples' costumes</font>

24
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:50,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the couples, she said wisely.</font>

25
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:52,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You should probably warn
your boyfriend's boyfriend.</font>

26
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just because we're dating doesn't mean</font>

27
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:54,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we have to do everything together.</font>

28
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you need to do
some things together.</font>

29
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We do some things.</font>

30
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do a lot of things.</font>

31
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:02,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all the things.</font>

32
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things.</font>

33
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:06,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, so, we're all here,
minus Pierce,</font>

34
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wasn't invited to Vicki's party</font>

35
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">for reasons beyond
ourcontrol or concern.</font>

36
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:12,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No mystery there. She put
a pencil through his face.</font>

37
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:15,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does Vicki have a TV?
- Abed, it's a party.</font>

38
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not watching TV.
- No, I'll be watching Annie.</font>

39
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">She started watching
Cougar town re-runs,</font>

40
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">which makes Annie
my third favorite show,</font>

41
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tonight is
their hallo-wine special.</font>

42
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, that's right.
Better not miss the Merlot.</font>

43
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clink! What?
You fall into it.</font>

44
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was Pierce.</font>

45
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">He accidentally locked himself</font>

46
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:30,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">in his panic room and he needs our help.</font>

47
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:31,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Oh!</font>

48
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:32,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, "Oh!"</font>

49
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh" means we are going
against our will,</font>

50
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:35,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we are not going.</font>

51
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying.</font>

52
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He seemed pretty upset,</font>

53
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's been all alone
up there in that mansion</font>

54
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:42,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever since I moved out,
and his dad, you know,</font>

55
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:44,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">got killed by Jeff.</font>

56
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm, calling for help.
A classic call for help.</font>

57
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Dr. Perry's Office.
Damaged psyche?</font>

58
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'll accept the charges.</font>

59
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Heads, lock up your brains.</font>

60
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's on the prowl
for fresh therapy meat.</font>

61
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe we should just stop by
on our way to the party.</font>

62
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I assure you,</font>

63
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only thing Pierce is
trapped in is adolescence.</font>

64
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a geriatric toddler,</font>

65
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">throwing the most elaborate
tantrums money can buy,</font>

66
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I, for one, am not gonna stand by</font>

67
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and allow some lonely, ridiculous person</font>

68
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">to derail our group's plans.</font>

69
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:15,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ding, ding, ding!
To your corners, fighters.</font>

70
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:19,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone save me a towel.</font>

71
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">you guys going to Vicki's party?</font>

72
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just gotta do this thing first.</font>

73
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ give me some rope ♪</font>

74
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:27,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ time in a dream ♪</font>

75
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ give me the hope to run out of steam ♪</font>

76
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ somebody said it could be here ♪</font>

77
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:38,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪</font>

78
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪</font>

79
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:47,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ one by one, they all just fade away ♪</font>

80
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.</font>

81
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:59,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy Helen, this place is huge.</font>

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It seems spookier than I remember.</font>

83
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah, the only thing spooky
about this place</font>

84
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the tacky decor.</font>

85
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like David Lee Roth
threw up Miami Vice.</font>

86
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">so tacky.</font>

87
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.</font>

88
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Pierce isn't doing so well</font>

89
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">since he lost his father
and then his inheritance</font>

90
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a video game battle with Gilbert,</font>

92
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I've never said it out loud.</font>

93
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, over here.</font>

94
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,151

98
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,056

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait!</font>

110
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might be a trap.
Or it might let him out.</font>

111
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, we—
- Oh, put a sock in it, shorts.</font>

112
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:55,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, hey, guys.</font>

113
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, are you okay?</font>

114
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, sure.
Fine, fine.</font>

115
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was dusting in here,</font>

116
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:04,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I must have bumped
a switch or something.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, not against my will.</font>

122
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been in there long?</font>

123
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, not long, but I couldn't
remember the damn code.</font>

We're happy to help.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
Do you have a TV?</font>

130
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:27,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What Abed means is, did you
write the code down anywhere?</font>

131
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:32,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes. It's in a red notebook
in my study</font>

132
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">or my bedroom, maybe.</font>

133
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:34,889

<font color="#FFFFFF">before I fired my maid.</font>

135

<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there's no reason to use my safe.</font>

136
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that's okay. We'll find it.
It'll take two secs.</font>

137
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:44,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or we take one sec
and just skip to the catch.</font>

138

<font color="#FFFFFF">This place has not been
dusted in months,</font>

139

<font color="#FFFFFF">and he starts with the panic room?</font>

140
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sale.
He's not a sad old man.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a sad old liar.
- Jeffrey!</font>

142

<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, he's right.
I've been lying to you.</font>

144
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get a glass
of red W—Uh, water,</font>

147
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I locked myself in here, on purpose.</font>

148
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,687

the code is True.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very thirsty.</font>

150

that awesome dusting story</font>

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if you knew what spooked me,</font>

153
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd probably call me crazy and old.</font>

154
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No one's gonna call you, Pierce.</font>

155
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can tell us.
We're here to help you.</font>

156
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought I saw my dad.
- Oh!</font>

157
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It looked like his face was
coming right through the wall,</font>

158
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:32,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that's impossible,
because my dad is dead.</font>

159
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- aha!</font>

160
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, not, aha, your dad is dead,</font>

161
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, aha, I knew it.</font>

162
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:42,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost dad, exploring
your haunted mansion</font>

163
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:43,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">for secret codes?</font>

164
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:46,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try, Pierce.
You gotta be kidding me!</font>

165
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:49,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the Scooby-Doo
is happening to you people?</font>

166
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff, just go to the party,
and we'll meet you there.</font>

167
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna stay here and help Pierce.</font>

168
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't need help.
He needs attention.</font>

169
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you really this naive?
- Am I naive?</font>

170
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure as stuff not
your sexy little ring girl.</font>

171
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I—
- Can it, ham.</font>

172
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's also my ride.</font>

173
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:10,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy said—</font>

174
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce's bedroom
is the third door on the left.</font>

175
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't leave my short-term
memory at Coachella.</font>

176
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:16,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeez, Winger, keep it above the belt.</font>

177
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Ah, already forgotten.</font>

178
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This house is getting to me.</font>

179
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:22,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know. Kind of weird that
a dead person used to live here.</font>

180
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, what's weird is that
a living person lived here</font>

181
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">with his parents, well into his 60s.</font>

182
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they died, and he's still here,</font>

183
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a paralyzed Peter Pan.</font>

184
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not for long.</font>

185
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:33,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna set my shrink-ray
to daddy issues</font>

186
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">and blast that sucker full of closure.</font>

187
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I guess it can't hurt.</font>

188
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Exactly, because,
in one way or another,</font>

189
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">therapy is always helpful.</font>

190
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, because there's no possible way</font>

191
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:43,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could mess him up worse.</font>

192
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like practicing on a cadaver.</font>

193
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock yourself out.</font>

194
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:47,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This has got to be it.</font>

195
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ugh.</font>

196
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I didn't have
so much exposed skin.</font>

197
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">agh.</font>

198
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tubular.</font>

199
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I, too, lack the adjectives.</font>

200
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ♪ Heaven— ♪</font>

201
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:06,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, how does one search
for a red notebook</font>

202
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't exist
without looking, touching,</font>

203
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">or creating future nightmares?</font>

204
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll check the nightstand.</font>

205
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll check my messages.</font>

206
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.</font>

207
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce keeps
his dad's bowtie by his bed.</font>

208
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeesh.</font>

209
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Table for siggy Freud,
party of—</font>

210
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, stop answering phones.</font>

211
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about we ask rip Van racism
where the codes are?</font>

212
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:27,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't. That's not nice.
- What?</font>

213
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a tight-Fisted,
philandering bigot</font>

214
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">who got to outlive most Bridges.</font>

215
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't owe him our reverence.</font>

216
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how about it, you old bag of dust?</font>

217
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got our numbers?</font>

218
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm serious. Stop it.
- Come on.</font>

219
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't really believe in ghosts?</font>

220
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know. I'm just
not so quick to rule it out.</font>

221
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe people can be haunted</font>

222
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">by unresolved issues in their past.</font>

223
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but issues
don't turn into ghosts.</font>

224
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe for Pierce, they have.</font>

225
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Pierce and his dad</font>

226
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">have some seriously unfinished business.</font>

227
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, the dead can't have business.</font>

228
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't want or think or do.</font>

229
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what makes them dead.</font>

230
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:58,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the living
who choose to be haunted.</font>

231
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius was barely a dad.</font>

232
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, he's nothing.</font>

233
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:04,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Pierce keeps staring into that void</font>

234
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">or he can turn around,
face his future like I did,</font>

235
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">and say, "who gives a crap
who my dad was?</font>

236
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm my own man now.
I—"</font>

237
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">wow.
Pretty slick, Britta,</font>

238
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">using ghosts to trick me
into opening up.</font>

239
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too bad it didn't work.</font>

240
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:21,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw, man, so this is
what the zone feels like.</font>

241
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!
Analyze this!</font>

242
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't want to go over
the same area twice,</font>

243
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">so be thorough.</font>

244
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thorough. Got it.</font>

245
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">More of a burnt umber, but I
won't hold that against him.</font>

246
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pierce Hawthorne's ideas for ladies"?</font>

247
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.</font>

248
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Blonde, long legs, with tennis racquet.</font>

249

00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:56,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big boobs, redhead, but doctor,"
question mark.</font>

251
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's not 100% on that one?</font>

252
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:01,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.</font>

253
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long is this?</font>

254
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I don't have the codes.</font>

255
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Shirley and Troy</font>

256
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">are having better luck in the library.</font>

257
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

258
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

259
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is supposed to be, like,</font>

260
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">that part in that movie
that's like this,</font>

261
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to remind you
that I don't watch scary movies</font>

262
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:33,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">and therefore cannot
appreciate the homage.</font>

263
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:46,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

264
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:48,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

265
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate reference humor.</font>

266
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:03,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold on.</font>

267
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been offended
by this coat rack before.</font>

268
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we going in circles?</font>

269
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, so maybe I spent</font>

270
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:10,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little less time in the library</font>

271
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:12,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">than, say,
the walk-In cereal closet,</font>

272
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:15,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's definitely near here.</font>

273
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You skipped this door.</font>

274
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce told me
I don't need to go in there.</font>

275
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- then it's probably the library.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Racist son of a—</font>

277

00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's Pierce's special gym.</font>

279
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never let me use it,
'cause he thinks I'm a child.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold—</font>

281
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's hiding the indoor swing,</font>

282
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,534

283

Come on. Oh, no.</font>

288
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:44,980

<font color="#FFFFFF">and then forget I knew what it was.</font>

290
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Great, you won't tell me,
Pierce won't tell me.</font>

291
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea what to Google.
I'll never know.</font>

292
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- believe me, dating Britta,</font>

293

with experienced tastes.</font>

296
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's nice you two are dating.</font>

297
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only hope she doesn't
make you feel pressured.</font>

298
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:05,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">- pressured to what?
- To fulfill her expectations.</font>

299
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:08,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expectations of what?</font>

300
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind.
- Unsatisfied with what?</font>

301
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:26,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whaaaa—Oh.
- Whaaaa—Oh.</font>

302
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:28,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I lost Abed.</font>

303
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I turned around and he disappeared.</font>

304
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:31,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I told you to never
let him out of your sight.</font>

305
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:34,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">That goes double for holidays
and wax museums.</font>

306
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are we gonna find him?</font>

307
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:37,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know, but we have to.</font>

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's probably already looking for us.</font>

309
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">- aah!</font>

310
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, well, that's hallo-Wine
in cougar town for ya.</font>

311
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:51,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ladies, I'll follow you anywhere.</font>

312
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do not have daddy issues.
- You get two minutes.</font>

313
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:56,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Denial is the first step
to acceptance.</font>

314
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that can't be right.
- Says the deny-ist.</font>

315
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:58,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not a word.</font>

316
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You want to keep digging this hole?</font>

317
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confronting your daddy issues now</font>

318
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">could prevent you from
ending up haunted, like Pierce.</font>

319
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll never end up like Pierce.
- Won't you?</font>

320
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:06,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, because I'm nothing like him.</font>

321
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- aren't you?
- Are you gonna keep doing that?</font>

322
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:10,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Am I?
- The worst therapist? No.</font>

323
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:11,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're not a therapist.</font>

324
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">But since your misdiagnosing by a mile,</font>

325
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">let me point out some differences.</font>

326
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce was raised by his dad.</font>

327
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine took off when I was eight.</font>

328
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce spent his whole, pathetic life</font>

329
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">begging for scraps
of his father's approval.</font>

330
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I moved on.</font>

331
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Pierce needs a dad.
I don't.</font>

332
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- don't you?
- Stop that!</font>

333
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if I need a dad so bad,</font>

334
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">how come I've had his
phone number for three weeks</font>

335
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:34,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">without the slightest urge to call him?</font>

336
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You found your dad?</font>

337
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did I?</font>

338
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give it here!</font>

339
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I remember when this show was
about a community college.</font>

340
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:50,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, you take the fish sticks, senator.</font>

341
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy the boat show.</font>

342
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">cool.</font>

343
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">cool, cool, cool.</font>

344
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:07,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just let me see the number,
for medical purposes!</font>

345
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!</font>

346
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help me heal your heart hole!</font>

347
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never!</font>

348
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, this is where Pierce
has been hiding the taste.</font>

349
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here's to you, Cornelius.</font>

350
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gone, But not forgiven.</font>

351
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:37,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

352
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, it wouldn't be pointless.</font>

353
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is pointless.</font>

354
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no Abed, no codes.</font>

355
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:50,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce sent us on a wild goose Chase.</font>

356
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff was right.
I am naive.</font>

357
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, don't listen to him.</font>

358
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:56,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">- there's nothing naive about
helping a friend in need.</font>

359
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:57,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff would know that
if he wasn't too cool</font>

360
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">for after-School specials.</font>

361
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, Troy.</font>

362
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- don't worry.
Abed's here.</font>

363
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel him.</font>

364
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should loop back
to the indoor swing room.</font>

365
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Indoor swing?
That's ridiculous.</font>

366
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's gonna break a lamp.</font>

367
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Break something on it.</font>

368
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, while I applaud
your gentle approach</font>

369
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">to psychoanalysis,</font>

370
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna talk about it.</font>

371
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:26,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, cut it out!</font>

372
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:31,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna break
the... door.</font>

373
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, look who came crawling back.</font>

374
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not crawling.
Walking. Quite briskly.</font>

375
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow!</font>

376
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I like talking to you,
Annie. It's easy.</font>

377
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you feel like
you can talk to me too.</font>

378
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ohh!</font>

379
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I—</font>

380
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Spit it out.
No secrets between roomies.</font>

381
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:03,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Behind you!</font>

382
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:04,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm behind you too.</font>

383
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hands! Wall!</font>

384
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not sure where you're going here,</font>

385
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:09,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just let it out.</font>

386
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:10,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- aah!
- Aah!</font>

387
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Waah! Aah! Don't let it out!
Don't let it out!</font>

388
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, Pierce,
turn off your haunted house!</font>

389
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- Aah!</font>

390
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:33,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.</font>

391
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:34,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cornelius killed him.</font>

392
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:38,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I broke the remote!
Do you think it's expensive?</font>

393
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, Pierce.</font>

394
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't die
slightly before your time.</font>

395
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This means we're next,
and I care about us.</font>

396
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay.
I've got the code.</font>

397
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!</font>

398
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:57,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where...</font>

399
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gotcha!</font>

400
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell?</font>

401
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I totally had you guys
convinced I was dead.</font>

402
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll teach you to value my presence.</font>

403
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce.
- Don't Pierce me.</font>

404
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were going to
Vicki's party without me.</font>

405
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bet you didn't expect me
to fake a haunted house</font>

406
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">to teach you a lesson.</font>

407
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:13,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's exactly what we expected.</font>

408
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- for heaven's sake, Pierce,</font>

409
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki's the one that didn't invite you.</font>

410
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you scare her?</font>

411
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:17,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 'cause I hate her.</font>

412
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, where have you been?</font>

413
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I found Pierce's
secret surveillance room.</font>

414
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you guys know he was
faking a haunted house?</font>

415
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This has been Abed nadir
with the late report.</font>

416
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry.
Good montages take time.</font>

417
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:29,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- man, it was so easy.</font>

418
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few shadows,
a couple of mirror tricks.</font>

419
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little, custom-built
latex walls,</font>

420
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:36,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're all crappin'
in your short pants.</font>

421
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:37,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was pretty impressive,</font>

422
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:38,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">particularly the shadowy figure</font>

423
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">you hired to watch you sleep.</font>

424
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow, that is creepy.</font>

425
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A stand-out performance.
Is he sad?</font>

426
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:47,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Emergency lockdown.</font>

427
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:49,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- I didn't hire anyone.</font>

428
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, enough, Pierce.
Just open the damn door.</font>

429
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:52,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no ghost.</font>

430
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:53,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then how do you explain this?</font>

431
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You probably asked someone</font>

432
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help you with your stupid prank</font>

433
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then forgot.</font>

434
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-Uh. Levar Burton
was a hard no.</font>

435
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one explanation.</font>

436
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I belittled my father's
good name for a prank,</font>

437
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:07,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his ghost has returned to scold me</font>

438
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">and probably Butcher you guys
for going along with it.</font>

439
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think hiding in this room
is gonna keep you safe?</font>

440
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ghosts can't go through doors, stupid.</font>

441
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not fire.</font>

442
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, I am paying
a teenager by the hour</font>

443
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">to care about my children
so I can go to this party,</font>

444
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you have to ask yourself,</font>

445
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the real threat out there or in here?</font>

446
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:26,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine.
I'll open it myself.</font>

447
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no.
He'll scold me!</font>

448
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!</font>

449
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Someone's punching in
the code from the outside.</font>

450
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:33,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please tell me one of us is outside.</font>

451
00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:35,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!</font>

452
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Emergency lockdown deactivated.</font>

453
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- May I be of some assistance?</font>

454
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilbert!</font>

455
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gilbert, what are you
doing in my house?</font>

456
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, technically, it's my house.</font>

457
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">After our father died,</font>

458
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I became the sole inheritor
of his estate,</font>

459
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:54,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">including all six houses and
the decommissioned submarine.</font>

460
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What?</font>

461
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you came here to kick me out?</font>

462
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Actually, I came here
to give you the deed,</font>

463
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:01,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">but on the day of my arrival,
you were out.</font>

464
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I noticed mail piled up by the door.</font>

465
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took it in, paid the overdue bills,</font>

466
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:08,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">replaced a few light bulbs, and, well,</font>

467
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:09,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was six weeks ago.</font>

468
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you've been living here
in secret this whole time?</font>

469
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:12,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.</font>

470
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ashamed to say</font>

471
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">that after a lifetime
as Cornelius's assistant,</font>

472
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had a difficult time
adjusting to his passing.</font>

473
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems his absence
has taken a greater toll</font>

474
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:23,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">than his presence ever did.</font>

475
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking care of Pierce
gave my life purpose again,</font>

476
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:29,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now that I've been
discovered by your thin friend,</font>

477
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must apologize and bid you adieu.</font>

478
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-Bye, Pierce.</font>

479
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a load of clean socks
in the dryer.</font>

480
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:40,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gilbert, Wait. Wait.</font>

481
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I've been doing really
well since dad died,</font>

482
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I don't need anyone
taking care of me,</font>

483
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:47,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you're having a tough time...</font>

484
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess I could use a roommate.</font>

485
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will there be anything else, brother?</font>

486
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes. Bring it in.</font>

487
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ohh.
- Ohh.</font>

488
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:05,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have fun at the party.</font>

489
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Vicki I say happy Halloween.</font>

490
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll mess with her.</font>

491
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sure you don't want to come?</font>

492
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:10,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got a Mask for you to wear.</font>

493
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">One that doesn't zip at the mouth.</font>

494
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, thanks.</font>

495
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll hang around here with Gilbert.</font>

496
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs me.</font>

497
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, that's nice.</font>

498
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:19,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was all that about masks?</font>

499
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't know, don't want to.</font>

500
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fair enough.</font>

501
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:25,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how about you and I
skip out on this party?</font>

502
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why? To do what
and where?</font>

503
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:28,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I was thinking you could show me</font>

504
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:29,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">some inspector spacetime.</font>

505
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:31,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're always talking about it.</font>

506
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen a full episode.</font>

507
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, are you sure you want to?</font>

508
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It starts pretty slow.</font>

509
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first inspector
couldn't even time-Travel.</font>

510
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:39,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uhh!
That sounds fine.</font>

511
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:40,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a night of running in circles,</font>

512
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:42,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to untie Winger knots,</font>

513
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for something slow.</font>

514
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:51,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry I ruined your night.</font>

515
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Actually, Pierce ruined my night,</font>

516
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you were right to let him.</font>

517
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:55,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You still want to go to the party?</font>

518
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard Vicki bought dry ice</font>

519
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:59,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gave Leonard the wrong address.</font>

520
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, I'll take a pass.
- Oh.</font>

521
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have some unfinished
business at home.</font>

522
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:50,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy!</font>

523
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:52,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you in here?</font>

524
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, was that you?</font>

525
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to show you something on
the other side of the bookcase.</font>

526
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy?</font>

527
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find me as soon as you can.</font>

528
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is in my house?</font>

529
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gilbert!</font>

530
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hijinks.</font>

531
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Indubitably.</font>

532
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:19,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did it work?
Are you tall?</font>
