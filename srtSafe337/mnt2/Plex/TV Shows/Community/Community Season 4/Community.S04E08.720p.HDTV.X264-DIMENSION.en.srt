1
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:04,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then in the season finale,</font>

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:06,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">they reveal the whole thing
was a dream,</font>

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:07,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the Inspector wakes up</font>

4
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:12,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">next to a very young
and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.</font>

5
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Pierce loves
this show now?</font>

6
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:15,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not <i>Inspector Spacetime.</i></font>

7
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the American version,
and it's a travesty.</font>

8
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's broad, obvious, sexist,
and the timing is...</font>

9
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:21,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, I'm dean!</font>

10
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:22,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
is wrong with you?</font>

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey, you are too much.</font>

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I was doing some
house cleaning the other day...</font>

13
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:30,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Deana Reed" style...
When I realized, "gosh, golly,</font>

14
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's been ages since we had
a dance."</font>

15
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:37,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, this Friday we are going
back to Greendale's golden age</font>

16
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an old-fashioned sock hop!</font>

17
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">The health department requires
you wear shoes.</font>

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a "coincidean."</font>

19
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're throwing a dance the
same day the CDC is confiscating</font>

20
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:47,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">our drinking fountains.
- Well...</font>

21
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Placating students
with a fun event.</font>

22
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Classic bread and circuses.</font>

23
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Ancient Rome, the emperor
would distract the populace</font>

24
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:55,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">from their problems by allocating
money for free bread and circuses.</font>

25
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:58,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been making a conscious effort to get
away from filtering everything through TV.</font>

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured it's time I showed some growth.
It's been three and a half seasons...</font>

27
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:01,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is what the old me
would have said.</font>

28
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:02,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Aww.</font>

29
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyhoo, it is
a Sadie Hawkins dance,</font>

30
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:08,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means girls ask the boys.
Oh, I love those!</font>

31
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:11,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, ladies, get out there
and make yourselves useful.</font>

32
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're saying
there's one day a year</font>

33
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:15,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">when women are free
to choose their own mates.</font>

34
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this,
cave-person times?</font>

35
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:20,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have already started
on a Sadie Hawkins banner,</font>

36
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">so this thing is
pretty much set in stone.</font>

37
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then maybe I'll throw
my own dance,</font>

38
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">one that doesn't conform
to your oppressive gender norms.</font>

39
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:27,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a break.</font>

40
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:31,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think a dance can just
be thrown together Willy-nilly?</font>

41
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I decide to just do</font>

42
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">a rain forest theme
and buy palm fronds</font>

43
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:37,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">and rig the sprinkler system
to...</font>

44
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:38,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on,
I gotta write this down.</font>

00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Britta, you're gonna
throw a protest dance?</font>

56
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:09,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a thing?</font>

57
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is now.</font>

58
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:13,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And instead of Sadie Hawkins,</font>

59
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">my dance will honor
a real feminist icon,</font>

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone who worked
for women's rights</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">every day of the year...
Sophie B. Hawkins.</font>

00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:23,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh...
- It wasn't really...</font>

63
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, Britta,
you're right.</font>

64
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:28,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Sophie B. Hawkins dance</font>

65
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">is just what
this school needs...</font>

66
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:30,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Jeff.</font>

67
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:34,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">To celebrate Sophie B. Hawkins
and all her accomplishments.</font>

68
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez, Winger, who's throwing
this dance, me or you?</font>

69
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Britta, I think you meant
to say Susan B. Anthony,</font>

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">not Sophie B. Hawkins.</font>

71
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:43,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta for the whoops!</font>

72
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you have a cat named
Susan B. Anthony?</font>

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you manage
to "Britta" that?</font>

74
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't "Britta" anything.
I meant Sophie B. Hawkins.</font>

75
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
Your plan was to throw a dance</font>

76
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">honoring the singer of
<i>damn I wish I was your lover?</i></font>

77
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:56,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">And <i>as I lay me down,</i></font>

78
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">which in my opinion
is the far superior song.</font>

79
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, that is a good song.
- Yeah.</font>

80
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

81
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am throwing
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance.</font>

82
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is gonna be amazing,</font>

83
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when people come
they're gonna be like,</font>

84
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">"damn! She straight
'Britta'd' this!"</font>

85
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:16,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, that's right,
I'm taking it back!</font>

86
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're really doing this?</font>

87
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, as someone who faked being
a lawyer for seven years</font>

88
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate your commitment
to the bit,</font>

89
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">but just admit you were wrong.</font>

90
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:29,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can say I "Britta'd" it?</font>

91
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course.
That goes without saying.</font>

92
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">But come on,
it was a small mistake.</font>

93
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call this off before it becomes
a full-scale "Brit-astrophe."</font>

94
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I coined that.
- Jeff,</font>

95
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:39,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't want
to come to my dance</font>

96
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are free to go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance,</font>

97
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:45,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">which will be happening at the
same time across the cafeteria.</font>

98
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:49,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Our school has limited venue options.
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.</font>

99
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and one last thing...
You do realize</font>

100
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:54,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">that if you call it
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance</font>

101
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:57,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">people will expect Sophie B. Hawkins
to actually be there, right?</font>

102
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:01,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

103
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when she comes
I'm gonna be like,</font>

104
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,296
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>"I will remember you</i>
<i>doubting me."</i></font>

105
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:09,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a Sarah Mclachlan song.</font>

106
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:14,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Abed, I was thinking
about what you said,</font>

107
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">about showing growth,
and I was thinking</font>

108
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe one way to do that is
to meet new people and...</font>

109
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's this going?
- Can I set you up with a date</font>

110
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:23,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the Sadie Hawkins day dance?
- A blind date.</font>

111
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always thought of myself
as more of an acquired taste... but...</font>

112
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

113
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, if you're open to meeting</font>

114
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone, there's a number
of eligible young ladies</font>

115
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:30,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my church.
- Shirley!</font>

116
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm already finding
a date for Abed.</font>

117
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I asked first.
- There's no reason we can't</font>

118
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">both help Abed find someone.
Why don't we each pick a girl</font>

119
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then let Abed decide,
instead of making it a competition.</font>

120
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly a competition.</font>

121
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So it is.
- Only for the loser.</font>

122
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need the computer.</font>

123
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, there are, like,
dozens of computers.</font>

124
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but my email is
on this one.</font>

125
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:51,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce!
- Jeez, what's up your butt?</font>

126
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:54,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have lied this morning
about meeting Sophie B. Hawkins</font>

127
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:55,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I didn't want Jeff
to make fun of me,</font>

128
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I may have lied
to cover that lie,</font>

129
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I'm in deep...</font>

130
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">lies.</font>

131
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?
So you told a lie, big deal.</font>

132
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">The important thing
is never to admit it.</font>

133
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I was thinking
about coming clean.</font>

134
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And give Winger
the satisfaction?</font>

135
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, no.</font>

136
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, anything could happen
between now and that dance.</font>

137
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">An asteroid could hit.</font>

138
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:18,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to be the schmuck who
apologizes just before the world ends?</font>

139
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:21,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">That kind of makes sense.
Thank you.</font>

140
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn right it makes sense.</font>

141
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking
to the wisest man on campus.</font>

142
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:27,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now seriously,
I need to get to my email.</font>

143
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">The post office
is about to close.</font>

144
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!</font>

145
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:33,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, check out my friend Britta's
Sophie B. Hawkins dance.</font>

146
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be spinning the hits
from yesterday and today,</font>

00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:37,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">which are basically the same
to me since I have Changnesia.</font>

148
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's like teflon.</font>

149
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how much awful stuff he does,
he keep getting another chance.</font>

150
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:43,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's like
the Colin Farrell of people.</font>

151
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to help me
with Britta's dance?</font>

152
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be a chance for classic
Troy and Abed hijinks.</font>

153
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the interest of growth
I'm trying to avoid hijinks,</font>

154
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">as well as capers, romps,
and exploits.</font>

155
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Escapades are a gray area.</font>

156
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed. This is Kat.</font>

157
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Kat.
Nice to meet you.</font>

158
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants to ask you something.</font>

159
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:01,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't she perfect for Abed?</font>

160
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's like one of those quirky
girls from the movies.</font>

161
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw her in the cafeteria trying
to pay for lunch with a song.</font>

162
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked if you'd go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance</font>

163
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">with me into the balloon.</font>

164
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you hear it?</font>

165
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, I'd be happy
to go with you.</font>

166
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Super duper mister Cooper!</font>

167
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

168
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you chose the girl
I picked.</font>

169
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool.</font>

170
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like it was a competition
or anything.</font>

171
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just be gentle when you tell
Shirley that she was the loser.</font>

172
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you want me to tell her?</font>

173
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:37,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool.
I'll handle it.</font>

174
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:40,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, was that girl an alien</font>

175
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:42,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a toddler with
a growing disease?</font>

176
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Abed.</font>

177
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to a lovely girl
at my church</font>

178
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she'd be happy to go
to the dance with you.</font>

179
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate it, Shirley,
but I...</font>

180
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you will
at least consider it,</font>

181
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not just because saying "no"
would crush this poor girl,</font>

182
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">but because I don't want you to miss out
on the opportunity of a lifetime.</font>

183
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

184
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to go to
Britta's dance with her.</font>

185
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, goody!
I'll set it up.</font>

186
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I hope this doesn't hurt
Annie's feelings.</font>

187
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:04,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I should go tell her.</font>

188
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need.
I'll handle it.</font>

189
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, okay.
- Bye-bye.</font>

190
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:11,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the risk of discovering
I'm living two parallel lives</font>

191
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:12,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">like that guy in <i>Awake,</i></font>

192
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you already have a date
to the dance?</font>

193
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.
Now I have two, which means</font>

194
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do the classic two dates
in one night sitcom trope.</font>

195
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get to wear two outfits.
Mix up their names.</font>

196
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe hide under a table.
- What about growth?</font>

197
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to go in
a more grounded direction,</font>

198
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I still ended up in a
comically implausible situation.</font>

199
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:27,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like Shirley said,</font>

200
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:29,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity for hijinks.</font>

201
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't pass it up.</font>

202
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like you already passed up
a great opportunity for hijinks.</font>

203
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:33,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did?</font>

204
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, duh doy!
Britta's dance?</font>

205
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think two dates is crazy?</font>

206
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Planning a dance is hijinks
city, population hijinks.</font>

207
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I need your help.</font>

208
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some ice?</font>

209
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wacwacky ice.
The ice will be wacky.</font>

210
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for the corsage.</font>

211
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:00,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it matches your carnation.
How cute.</font>

212
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm glad you like it.</font>

213
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:03,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was afraid you'd think
it was old-fashioned.</font>

214
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:06,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like old-fashioned.
I find it refreshing.</font>

215
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of refreshing,
I'm gonna get us some punch.</font>

216
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Be right back.
- Oh!</font>

217
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Kevin.</font>

218
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently I'm your DJ tonight.</font>

219
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I really don't know what
I'm doing, so...</font>

220
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have a request,
please be specific.</font>

221
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:23,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have Changnesia.</font>

222
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you?</font>

223
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I just wanted to try on
a different look.</font>

224
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:33,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty indecisive,
so I may be back here</font>

225
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">a few times, if that's okay.</font>

226
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.</font>

227
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:38,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also gonna need to check
this Gideon's Bible</font>

228
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:40,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this jelly bean
kaleidoscope.</font>

229
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Icebreakers.
- Mm.</font>

230
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Britta.
Where's Sophie B.?</font>

231
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she backstage drinking Zima
and counting her beanie babies?</font>

232
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I can't divulge that.</font>

233
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stars and their privacy,
you know.</font>

234
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she'll definitely be here?</font>

235
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
Sophie be coming.</font>

236
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it just be coincidence
that somebody posted</font>

237
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:59,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">a craigslist ad an hour ago</font>

238
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">that says, "looking for
Sophie B. Hawkins,</font>

239
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">"or convincing
Sophie B. Hawkins impersonator</font>

240
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:07,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">to play community college
dance tonight.</font>

241
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very little money."</font>

242
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:10,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's weird
how in demand she is.</font>

243
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good thing we booked her early.</font>

244
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, we're running low
on chips.</font>

245
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what I'm thinking.</font>

246
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go over
to the Sadie Hawkins dance</font>

247
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">as the snack inspector,
doing random spot checks,</font>

248
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:21,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">and confiscate their chips.</font>

249
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I need is a disguise.</font>

250
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you could just go
to the supply closet</font>

251
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:26,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get some more chips.</font>

252
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but I-I still need
to use the moustache probably.</font>

253
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:35,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, in lieu of flowers</font>

254
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you this.
It's quirky.</font>

255
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, guv'nor!</font>

256
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:41,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just put it
in me invisible sack.</font>

257
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm gonna get us
some punch.</font>

258
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:49,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

259
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are things going with you
and Jessica?</font>

260
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you two— as they say on TV—
making a connection?</font>

261
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless that means sex, in which
case I hope you are not.</font>

262
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are great.</font>

263
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, Jessica did mention
that she's cold.</font>

264
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could she borrow your sweater?
- Oh.</font>

265
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the purple one you wore last week.
I didn't see you wear it home,</font>

266
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I think it's still in your locker
next to your umbrella.</font>

267
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I guess I could check.
- Could you?</font>

268
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That'd be great.
- Okay.</font>

269
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, roomie.</font>

270
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:11,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think of Kat?</font>

271
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she tell you she plays
the saw?</font>

272
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought she was
in an all-girl kazoo band?</font>

273
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need a rhythm section,
duh.</font>

274
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, keep me posted.
I'm gonna go say hi to Britta.</font>

275
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't!</font>

276
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you have something
in your teeth.</font>

277
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:23,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of somethings.</font>

278
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do?
What is it?</font>

279
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I can't tell in this light.
But it's definitely there.</font>

280
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should probably check it out
in the bathroom.</font>

281
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the second floor one?
Better light.</font>

282
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.
Thank you.</font>

283
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:33,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good friend.</font>

284
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeffrey.</font>

285
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you enjoying the sock hop?</font>

286
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sock hop Britta has
all but "Britta'd"</font>

287
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:50,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">by not "Britta-ing"
her own dance.</font>

288
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the night is young.</font>

289
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- By the way,</font>

290
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised you let her share
the cafeteria with you.</font>

291
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I didn't want to.
But once she guaranteed</font>

292
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">the presence of a certain
someone, I couldn't say no.</font>

293
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:02,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't get your hopes
up for Sophie B...</font>

294
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:05,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, it's me.
- Shall we dance? Whoop.</font>

295
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:09,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you reading the Bible?
- No spoilers.</font>

296
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:12,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really hoping that things
turn around for this job guy.</font>

297
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how do I look?</font>

298
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:16,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Except you gotta lose the hat.</font>

299
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:18,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't go with
the minister's daughter.</font>

300
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm doing.</font>

301
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
You're on two dates at once.</font>

302
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been watching you
since you came in.</font>

303
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not good with faces.
Is that a judgmental face</font>

304
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a happy face?
- I think it's awesome.</font>

305
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one of my favorite bits,
like when a dog acts embarrassed,</font>

306
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">or when a guy
chases after the girl</font>

307
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then does that big public
declaration of love.</font>

308
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not realistic. It's taking something
private and turning it into a performance.</font>

309
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think
the dog's trained.</font>

310
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was talking about
the public declaration of love...</font>

311
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, you're messing with me.
- Yes, I was.</font>

312
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:49,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this thing's turning out to be a little
tougher than I thought. You wanna help?</font>

313
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to,
but I've still got like</font>

314
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">1,200 pages left of this Bible.
Yes, of course I would.</font>

315
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:55,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.</font>

316
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight's Sadie Hawkins dance</font>

317
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:59,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">is brought to you
by Hawthorne Wipes.</font>

318
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the little lady who knows
her place in the kitchen.</font>

319
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tonight's
Sophie B. Hawkins dance</font>

320
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">is brought to you
by Hawthorne Wipes.</font>

321
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect for cleaning the
dashboard of your '92 Subaru.</font>

322
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:14,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, quite a turnout, Britta.</font>

323
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:18,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. Didn't know Sophie B.
Hawkins was so big at Greendale.</font>

324
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
A large percentage of Greendale</font>

325
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">students sort of gave up
in the mid '90s,</font>

326
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">so for many of them</font>

327
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:27,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie B. Hawkins is the most
recent music they're aware of.</font>

328
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:31,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, her coming here is gonna
be a huge boost to their spirits.</font>

329
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:32,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

330
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whereas, her not showing up</font>

331
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be enough
to push these people</font>

332
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">to such a dark place
and really question</font>

333
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:42,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">whether life is worth living
at all.</font>

334
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:45,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, bye-bye.</font>

335
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how long have you been
doing Bible studies?</font>

336
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, making miniature hats
out of duct tape?</font>

337
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, duct tape hat...
- Oh!</font>

338
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

339
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:58,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you've never seen any
of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?</font>

340
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were taught popular films
were the work of the devil.</font>

341
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you're talking about
<i>the Phantom Menace,</i></font>

342
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were taught right.</font>

343
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:06,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Telegram.
- Ooh, yeah, it's urgent.</font>

344
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.</font>

345
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, Sophie B. Hawkins
isn't coming.</font>

346
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's gonna know
I'm a liar.</font>

347
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help me.
- Oh, Britta.</font>

348
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:17,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you a story about
a friend of mine</font>

349
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">that everyone called a liar.</font>

350
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name was Bernie Madoff.</font>

351
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!
He was a liar.</font>

352
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stole billions of dollars
from his clients.</font>

353
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has this been confirmed?</font>

354
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:31,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
I "Britta'd" it.</font>

355
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernie?</font>

356
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, hi, Shirley.
- Hello, Annie.</font>

357
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed seems to be having a good
time, which is all that matters.</font>

358
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

359
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:44,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like he made
the right choice.</font>

360
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">He certainly did.</font>

361
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we agree.
The best woman won.</font>

362
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">She certainly did.</font>

363
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:53,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's on two dates, isn't he?</font>

364
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">He certainly is.</font>

365
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the most fun I've ever
had on a work study gig.</font>

366
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I used to run
the frozen yogurt machine</font>

367
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">before that old guy broke it.</font>

368
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been
so many close calls.</font>

369
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep forgetting details,
using the wrong names,</font>

370
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">- having to duck behind plants.
- Aah!</font>

371
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:08,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">This night has been perfect.</font>

372
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what else is on the list?</font>

373
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Sorry.</font>

374
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:21,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this were a movie, this would
be the part where we kiss.</font>

375
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:23,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

376
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except we're doing a sitcom trope,
so it'd be totally out of place.</font>

377
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to go get caught and make an
impassioned plea to the girl I really like.</font>

378
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm gonna
go with Jessica.</font>

379
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">She seems to be
the audience favorite.</font>

380
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, bye.</font>

381
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

382
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you really think
you'd get away with this?</font>

383
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:44,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me explain.
- What about wanting to grow?</font>

384
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or was that just a lie so you could do
another world-famous Abed TV adventure?</font>

385
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:49,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are real people
you're messing with.</font>

386
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:52,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kat is over there hula-hooping
all by herself.</font>

387
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:56,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, in the real world people
can actually get hurt.</font>

388
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:02,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is great.
So, I got a request for,</font>

389
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You suck at this.
Get off the stage."</font>

390
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I don't know if that's
the band or the song.</font>

391
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, apologies.
Changnesia.</font>

392
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it blew up in my face,</font>

393
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a slightly different way than
I planned.</font>

394
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I help you?
- Where's Rachel?</font>

395
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She said she had to go.
- Where?</font>

396
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
She seemed upset.</font>

397
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">She ran out of here without
tagging half this stuff.</font>

398
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, whose water wings
are these?</font>

399
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:27,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back here!</font>

400
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind.</font>

401
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:41,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

402
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did mean what
I said about growth.</font>

403
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you were both so intent on
getting me dates, I couldn't help myself.</font>

404
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was wrong, and hurtful.</font>

405
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see that now.</font>

406
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:51,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe setting you up
was a bad idea.</font>

407
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess neither of our
girls were really right for you.</font>

408
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">The worst part is that I met
a girl tonight that I really do like.</font>

409
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was so busy chasing one trope,
I missed the trope right under my nose...</font>

410
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the girl I liked all along
was under my nose.</font>

411
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:05,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I've screwed things up.
I don't know if I can make them right.</font>

412
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:05,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

413
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
This one's real, right?</font>

414
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:08,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm really sad.</font>

415
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:09,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

416
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, go find her, dummy.</font>

417
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, haven't you ever seen
a movie?</font>

418
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!</font>

419
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:20,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.</font>

420
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate to say I told you so,</font>

421
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna say it
to Britta's face.</font>

422
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!</font>

423
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:28,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the nature of hope?</font>

424
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie's not coming, guys.</font>

425
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:35,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo! Boo!</font>

426
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone
underestimated</font>

427
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">the time it takes
to plan a dance.</font>

428
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey!
It's Sophie B. Hawkins!</font>

429
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening!
I'm Sophie B. Hawkins.</font>

430
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you know this one.</font>

431
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

432
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ That old dog has chained
you up all right ♪</font>

433
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Give you everything
you need ♪</font>

434
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:10,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ To live inside
a twisted cage ♪</font>

435
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:12,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Sleep beside an empty rage</font>

436
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you do this?</font>

437
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's possible
to make something happen</font>

438
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:17,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">by willing it,
then, yes, I did.</font>

00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:22,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Damn, I wish
I was your lover ♪</font>

440

<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I'd rock you till
the daylight comes ♪</font>

441
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:27,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Made sure you are smiling
and warm ♪</font>

442
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I am everything</font>

443
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ tonight I'll be your mother</font>

444
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I'll do such things
to ease your pain ♪</font>

445
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:38,228

<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, Sophie.</font>

448
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something to say.</font>

449
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a girl here tonight.
Her name was Rachel.</font>

450
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:51,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met her,
and it was very pleasant.</font>

451
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I made a mistake.</font>

452
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:58,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'd very much like to continue
this conversation in private.</font>

453
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, viva lost love.</font>

454
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Damn</font>

455
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I wish I was your lover</font>

456
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I'd rock you till
the daylight comes... ♪</font>

457
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You came back.
- That was pretty embarrassing.</font>

458
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had to...
- Hmm.</font>

459
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:17,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was.
But I'm glad I did it.</font>

460
00:18:17,957 --> 00:18:20,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, would you like
to go out sometime?</font>

461
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:21,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like that.</font>

462
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to pretend like you're
just going out with me on a bet?</font>

463
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I'd like that very much.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

464
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe we should try
normal first.</font>

465
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure.
- Oh!</font>

466
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:34,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I prefer <i>As I Lay Me Down.</i>
<i>- Me too.</i></font>

467
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
she pulled this off.</font>

468
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

469
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:42,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to dean law,
I must now give her my amulet.</font>

470
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Hmm?</font>

471
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she had a little help
from a wise old man</font>

472
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:50,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">who was the official supplier
of moist towelettes</font>

473
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the lilith fair between
1997 and 1999.</font>

474
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:55,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it.
You're safe.</font>

475
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did this?
But why?</font>

476
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, in the face
of all logic and reason,</font>

477
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta didn't back down.
That makes no sense.</font>

478
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I didn't like the way you
were being such a jerk to her.</font>

479
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she was acting crazy.</font>

480
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:10,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but what choice
did she have?</font>

481
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make fun of her, you use her
name as a synonym for screwing up.</font>

482
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut her some slack, Jeff.</font>

483
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">She helped you reconcile
with your dad.</font>

484
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Pete's sake,
let her be happy.</font>
