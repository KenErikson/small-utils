<font color="#FFFFFF">Sat score zero.</font>

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was recently arrested
for selling marijuana</font>

5
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:13,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a police officer
at a police station.</font>

6
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:16,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you want us to help
you recruit this idiot</font>

7
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of an honors student
or a science genius?</font>

8
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we go to the same Greendale?</font>

9
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:24,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, but let me reveal the
fortune inside this cookie.</font>

10
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:26,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family net worth, $8 million.</font>

11
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:29,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
this is what we</font>

12
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:32,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the community college
recruiting game call a "whale."</font>

13
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The perfect mix
of low intellect,</font>

14
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:38,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">high lack of ambition,
and limitless parental support.</font>

15
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:41,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, a rich dumb-dumb
who will never graduate</font>

16
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and keep dropping money into the
school indefinitely. Got it.</font>

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there really that much
money in this, Dean,</font>

18
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">or is it like that endorsement deal
you made with let's potato chips?</font>

19
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't like the
crispy-licious taste of Let's,</font>

23
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:02,383

of this whale by describing one</font>

27
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:13,840

who has ever paid for a premium locker</font>

29
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce cannot know about this.</font>

30
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:22,341

when anyone else gets attention.</font>

31
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when Kerri Strug
visited our campus?</font>

00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was horrible.
- That was awful.</font>

33

<font color="#FFFFFF">I have scheduled
Archie's visit for tomorrow</font>

34

of the forensics club.</font>

37
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,438

the whale money for a new body farm.</font>

38

- Who wants to help?</font>

39
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.
Sounds like a romper.</font>

40
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do need money.</font>

41

the same dead pig for 10 years.</font>

we can buy 100 dead pigs</font>

43
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make everybody happy.</font>

44
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll help where I can, but
I started a new PE class.</font>

45

<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been avoiding it for three years,
but you can't run from running forever.</font>

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in PE too.</font>

47
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made room in my trophy case.</font>

48
00:01:57,608 --> 00:01:59,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, I remembered classes
don't give out trophies,</font>

49
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:01,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I put a fishbowl
there instead.</font>

50
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been quite the week.</font>

51
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the rest of us will
have to pick up the slack,</font>

52
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:08,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, yes, Jeffrey,
I assume you're out,</font>

53
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of your track record of
literally being too cool for school.</font>

54
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you can
count me in on this one.</font>

55
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,450

56
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,295

57
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,841

It's weird.</font>

58
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,126

it to me as a present.</font>

- Mmm-hmm.</font>

192
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,762

bought you a vespa?</font>

194
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,749

have you heard about</font>

195
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:41,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">our half-pipes and hash pipes class,
taught by professor Shaun White?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yeah, let me tell you about it</font>

197

<font color="#FFFFFF">in our Mountain Dew
cool zone tent.</font>

198
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,396

Dew" on it, make it cool.</font>

199
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, here we go. Let's keep going.
This is our library.</font>

200
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

201
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Archie, why don't you
"hang ten" on the web</font>

202
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I talk business,
and you know what?</font>

203
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can take that computer.</font>

204
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:01,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wah!
Sweet!</font>

205
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends and I can
drop it off an overpass.</font>

206
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I shouldn't
have heard that.</font>

207
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, you're giving him
our computers?</font>

208
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:12,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a 22-year-old stoner-head
whose parents bought him a GED.</font>

209
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which college is he
going to choose?</font>

210
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:16,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vespa state, or "ooh, look
at our library" university?</font>

211
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those school board guys
were right.</font>

212
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, where do we get drugs?
- Really?</font>

213
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who stumbled
onto the high road.</font>

214
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a slippery slope.</font>

215
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:27,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, city college slipped that slope
when they slipped him that scooter,</font>

216
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they sure slipped up when they
let him set foot on our soil.</font>

217
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three, two, one!</font>

218
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time!</font>

219
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coach Barnes, it seems
dodge ball storage</font>

220
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't quite in your skill set,</font>

221
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">much like table tennis prep.</font>

222
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent job, coach Bennett.</font>

223
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the spatial reasoning
skills of a young Kevin Miller,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">a really good PE teacher
I know.</font>

225
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,061

order of ability is crucial.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">In this next drill, our
two best student coaches</font>

227
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">will split the rest
of the class,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">coach Bennett, coach Neil.</font>

229
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,582

- Ooh, coach Dornetto.</font>

233
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Coach Guest.
- Coach Panos!</font>

234
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

235
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Choose wisely.</font>

236
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:16,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one decision away
from victory or defeat.</font>

237
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coach...</font>

238

<font color="#FFFFFF">Marzec.</font>

239
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yay!</font>

240
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:23,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well picked, coach Bennett.</font>

241
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your team wins!</font>

242
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:27,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we won!
Nice!</font>

243
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the barbershop.</font>

244
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">A reminder of a bygone era
when men were men,</font>

245
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">and women were sex
cooks who did laundry.</font>

246
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been getting a daily
shave here for decades.</font>

247
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:40,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">And apparently, reading the same
eight magazines the entire time.</font>

248
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, National Geographic's
got some</font>

249
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">tribal boob shots
that are exquisite.</font>

250
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something
about a breast</font>

251
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's never been touched
by white hands.</font>

252
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a complicated man.</font>

253
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:54,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silvio, spin up
lucky number seven.</font>

254
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
That feels good,</font>

255
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you that.</font>

256
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that soda goblet</font>

257
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">gets you free refills
in the cafeteria,</font>

258

<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, check out that bling!</font>

262
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want that.</font>

263
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard him, Annie!
Bling the king!</font>

264
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:22,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, just take it off of him.</font>

265
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:23,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There you go.
- Thank you.</font>

266

271
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gosh dean it, Abed!
I told you, no fraternities!</font>

272
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's soda all over my kicks!</font>

273
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:40,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, give Archie your scarf
so he can dry his kicks.</font>

274
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,325

Put your back into it!</font>

275

that sheik I met at trader Joe's.</font>

maybe a faithful dog.</font>

282

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, I had a chocolate lab
growing up, Rosie.</font>

283

a German Shepherd.</font>

It's not even noon.</font>

450

<font color="#FFFFFF">I will neither chill nor relax.</font>

451
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this hoopla is not
what Greendale really is.</font>

452
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is
a nice welcome banner.</font>

453
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale is
a foamless cafeteria.</font>

454
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Greendale is Magnitude
saying "pop pop."</font>

455
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:25,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I am a man
of very little integrity,</font>

456
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:29,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I let students get away with
practically anything on this campus,</font>

457
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:32,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will not allow Greendale</font>

458
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">to lose the things
that make it Greendale.</font>

459
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Archie, I would love for
you to enroll in my school,</font>

460
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will not
change it for you.</font>

461
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale will stay Greendale,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter what.</font>

463
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

464
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody kisses my ass
because my dad is loaded,</font>

465
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they always give me
free stuff,</font>

466
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">like that jet ski I sunk,</font>

467
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:56,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it would be pretty sweet</font>

468
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be treated
like a normal dude...</font>

up situations like this.</font>
