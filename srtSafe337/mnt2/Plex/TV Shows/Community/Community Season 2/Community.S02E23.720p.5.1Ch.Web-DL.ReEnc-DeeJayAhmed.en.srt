<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't outrun me.
I see you, fat-ass!</font>

2
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:18,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

3
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, okay?
I don't even have a gun.</font>

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't this against the rules?</font>

5
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one rule,
Fat Neil.</font>

6
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:26,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prize goes
to the last man standing.</font>

7
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">So to speak.</font>

8
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:36,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were a dude,
I'd have my fist up your balls.</font>

9
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:42,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Annie.</font>

10
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick their guns to me.</font>

11
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick. Don't reach.</font>

12
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

13
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christina "Reach-y",</font>

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said kick.</font>

15
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, take it easy.</font>

16
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:57,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta learn
to trust people.</font>

17
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:04,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you leave me
with a little something?</font>

18
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:05,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're friends, Annie.</font>

19
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember?</font>

20
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">We played Dungeons & Dragons together.</font>

21
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a game.</font>

22
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:16,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is paintball.</font>

00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
a couple of announcements.</font>

25
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to thank Pistol Patty's
Cowboy Creamery</font>

26
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,235

our end-of-the-year picnic.</font>

27
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:13,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

28
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free ice cream and that one guy</font>

31
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna end this year
with a quick game</font>

32
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Paintball Assassin.</font>

33
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year's big mistake</font>

34
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">was way too valuable a prize.</font>

35
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been assured...</font>

36
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:33,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">That this year
will be different.</font>

37
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:38,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">So take it away, Pistol Patty!</font>

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Howdy, folks.</font>

39
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one rule.</font>

40
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last man standing
gets the prize.</font>

41
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's your guns.</font>

42
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,533

<font color="#FFFFFF">$100,000 cash.</font>

44
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go nuts!</font>

45
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a rumor you never
shoot an unarmed man.</font>

46
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever started that rumor
didn't eat my beans.</font>

47
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess it's lucky for me
I'm not unarmed.</font>

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing as I'm...</font>

49
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eating your beans.</font>

50
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:41,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff wants to see you.</font>

51
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
And I want pants.</font>

52
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of people
want a lot of things.</font>

53
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't hurt
to hear him out, will it?</font>

54
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a good hiding spot
in the library.</font>

55
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">As safe as you are here,
you'll be safer with us.</font>

56
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

57
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Math club's gotten a lot
better since last year.</font>

58
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, they were practicing</font>

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">while the rest of us
went on dates.</font>

60
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on.
I have a plan.</font>

61
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Math club!</font>

62
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

63
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:08,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Asian.</font>

64
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:10,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys Asian?</font>

65
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:12,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty racist, man.</font>

66
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't a no.</font>

67
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming over!</font>

68
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot me, shoot him.</font>

69
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's white,
and he's out of ammo.</font>

70
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:20,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap.</font>

71
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:37,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you Abet!</font>

72
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:38,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot Chang!</font>

73
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:39,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">He defected to the math club.</font>

74
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come back club!
- Agh.</font>

75
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it.</font>

76
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a waste of ammo.</font>

77
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:46,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go grab their paint.</font>

78
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:47,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

79
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:50,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm much safer
with you guys.</font>

80
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:51,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milady.</font>

81
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want, Jeff?</font>

82
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yikes.
Well, what do we all want?</font>

83
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ammo.</font>

84
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:56,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much you got left?</font>

85
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:58,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">$100,000$ worth.</font>

86
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're running low, too.</font>

87
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut up, Abed.
- Okay.</font>

88
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:02,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you heard
about Pierce?</font>

89
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:03,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he's still alive,</font>

90
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">holed up near the cafeteria.</font>

91
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hear he has more paint</font>

92
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">than a French kindergarten.</font>

93
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you proposing we join him?</font>

94
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm proposing
his ammo joins us.</font>

95
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't changed.</font>

96
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:13,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think Pierce has?</font>

97
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:14,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, let's not rehash this.</font>

98
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:15,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy's been a jerk all year.</font>

99
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:17,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a jerk
because we exclude him.</font>

100
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">We exclude him
because he's a jerk.</font>

101
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:21,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the last time I checked,
you were the last one</font>

102
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:23,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">feeling sorry about it.</font>

103
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm still waiting
for you guys to come around.</font>

104
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:39,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Likewise.</font>

105
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:43,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm...
I am dead now.</font>

106
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dead.</font>

107
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wears spurs in paintball?</font>

108
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:06,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy that's gonna win.</font>

110
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

111
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that guy
even go to this school?</font>

112
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's really good-looking.</font>

113
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, network TV good-looking.</font>

114
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did you see how big
his guns were?</font>

115
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just
marry him, Abed?</font>

116
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying
paintball is tough this year.</font>

117
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree.</font>

118
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:39,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, Britta.</font>

119
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't hit all three of us.</font>

120
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:42,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't have to.</font>

121
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Troy.
- Abed!</font>

122
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought you were dead.
- I thought you were dead.</font>

123
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys.
- Oh, right.</font>

124
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the power invested
in us as deputies,</font>

125
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">we now pronounce you arrested.</font>

126
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputies? What are you,
Deputies of the Stairwell?</font>

127
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fort Hawthorne.</font>

128
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a bounty
on your head, my friend.</font>

129
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.</font>

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">My forehead's
not that big, right?</font>

131
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- It's not small.</font>

132
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:20,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you guys let Pierce boss you around</font>

133
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">in exchange for paint pellets?</font>

134
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, Jeff,
he's been pretty decent</font>

135
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this game so far.</font>

136
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:25,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's created a safe zone</font>

137
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">where people can rest, eat,
and if necessary,</font>

138
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">pump their breast milk.</font>

139
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:29,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that sounds
very nice of him.</font>

140
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beats standing around
with empty guns,</font>

141
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting to get picked off
by the Black Rider.</font>

142
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you talking
about the handsome blond cowboy</font>

143
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:36,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the big guns?</font>

144
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that guy a student?</font>

145
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:39,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who... Who is he?</font>

146
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:40,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just call him
the Black Rider.</font>

147
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but he's not really
riding anything.</font>

148
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't name people,
Annie.</font>

149
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a deputy.</font>

150
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deputize.</font>

151
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to surrender
your guns.</font>

152
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your drugs.</font>

153
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

154
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">My study group.</font>

155
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has it been?</font>

156
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five hours.
- Too long.</font>

157
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:18,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.</font>

158
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is this even possible?</font>

159
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:22,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">It began with a dream, Annie.</font>

160
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:25,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dream and an impulse to hide
in the men's room.</font>

161
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found that people
were willing to roll bullets</font>

162
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:28,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the door,</font>

163
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">just for the right
to take a dump.</font>

164
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, for you guys,</font>

165
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">taking a dump is on the house.</font>

166
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:38,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or if you prefer,
relax and catch a show.</font>

167
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane.</font>

168
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, Jeff.</font>

169
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've also got someone
more your speed.</font>

170
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're gay.</font>

171
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:50,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
I think I've seen enough,</font>

172
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd like my gun back now.</font>

173
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Hawthorne personnel</font>

174
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">can carry weapons
inside, Jeffrey.</font>

175
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
you got us here unarmed,</font>

176
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:00,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">at your mercy.</font>

177
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

178
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll discuss over dinner.</font>

179
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're famished.</font>

180
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, we feast.</font>

181
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the twinkies
are wonderful tonight.</font>

182
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us some space, Miguel.</font>

183
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:21,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I told you guys
I know where to find</font>

184
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">enough ammo to end
this cowardly hiding out,</font>

185
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">and split the prize seven ways?</font>

186
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">So send your goons to get it.</font>

187
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, they'd never bring it back.</font>

188
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">We trust each other.
We're a study group.</font>

189
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty warm
and fuzzy talk</font>

190
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming from you, Pierce.</font>

191
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm, you've kind of acted
like a villain this year.</font>

192
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have?
- Well...</font>

193
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A little bit.
- You guys.</font>

194
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce is reaching out.</font>

195
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:44,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not risking my butt
hauling ammo back</font>

196
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:46,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the guy that has Vicky
dancing for twinkies.</font>

197
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a dance major, Jeff.</font>

198
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:49,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she loves twinkies.</font>

199
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you ever took the time
to get to know he...</font>

200
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:53,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

201
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Summer starts tomorrow.</font>

202
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you guys,
it means pool parties,</font>

203
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:03,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">dinners,
one-night stands.</font>

204
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me...</font>

205
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means counting down the days
'til next fall.</font>

206
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:13,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we go,
let me do this for you.</font>

207
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:16,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me bring us victory.</font>

208
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

209
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

210
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the study group.</font>

211
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:44,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the study group.</font>

212
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:46,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">More juice, Miguel.</font>

213
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope we find this cache
of ammunition soon.</font>

214
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to pump.</font>

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

216
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talking' about peeing,
right?</font>

217
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Me, neither.</font>

218
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, about Pierce.</font>

219
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel bad.</font>

220
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't put
so much effort into...</font>

221
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
I just think...</font>

222
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">The study group
is my family, you know?</font>

223
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we start
picking and choosing...</font>

224
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do we stop?</font>

225
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:10,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.</font>

226
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good kid.</font>

227
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I wanna do my part
to help you stay that way.</font>

228
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Benjamin Chang,</font>

229
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:22,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your betrayal
of the Cheerleaders' Alliance,</font>

230
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:25,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sentence you
to pretendsies death.</font>

231
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:25,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

232
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.</font>

233
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I betrayed the math club
for you.</font>

234
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:29,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready...
- Heather!</font>

235
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I told Trish
about Amber!</font>

236
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:34,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aim...
- Fire.</font>

237
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Holy crap.
- Not cool, bitch.</font>

238
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so you told me
at last year's tryouts.</font>

239
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave the guns.</font>

240
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatev.</font>

241
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:48,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's there?</font>

242
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:49,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I join you?</font>

243
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- Okay.</font>

244
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, I'm out.
Gimme your gun.</font>

245
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, be careful.</font>

246
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheerleaders rule!</font>

247
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:11,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take that.</font>

248
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

249
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the bad guy.</font>

250
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop trying to fluster me
with your handsomeness.</font>

251
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:21,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're creepy.</font>

252
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why is your chest
getting all flushed?</font>

253
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:26,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a rash.</font>

254
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:28,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm allergic to beans.</font>

255
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:30,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, do you even go
to school here?</font>

256
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I get paid
to shoot paintballs, honey.</font>

257
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the breeze.</font>

258
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lame.</font>

259
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll hit you in the foot.</font>

260
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

261
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're dry, sugar.</font>

262
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

263
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:53,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

264
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll save you for last.</font>

265
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't get the chance.</font>

266
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

267
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:22,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a better look at him.</font>

268
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not that good-looking.</font>

269
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Didn't he shoot you?
- He tried.</font>

270
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a bad shot, too?</font>

271
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:27,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, what does this guy</font>

272
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">have going for him?</font>

273
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:34,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce loaded your gun
with blanks.</font>

274
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, don't shoot!</font>

275
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:48,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does this keep happening?</font>

276
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what kind of ice cream
company does this?</font>

277
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the paintball stuff
from last year?</font>

278
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hid it</font>

279
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the school doesn't get
destroyed again.</font>

280
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too late.</font>

281
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:00,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi, Jeff.</font>

282
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just ran
into the Black Rider.</font>

283
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:04,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, if you want this game
to end,</font>

284
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">we need firepower.</font>

285
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there.</font>

286
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key's in my shorts.</font>

287
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get it out, I guess.</font>

288
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is more like it.</font>

289
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Black Rider.</font>

290
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let's see who's attractive.</font>

291
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:38,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you have a problem.</font>

292
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:39,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

293
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice.</font>

294
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, where you going?</font>

295
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">To have a conversation
with Pierce.</font>

296
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's pretty awesome today.</font>

297
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:02,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

298
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black Rider.</font>

299
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:04,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wiped out the whole fort.</font>

300
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you still here?</font>

301
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't go back out there.</font>

302
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:10,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only life I know.</font>

303
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie?</font>

304
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you?</font>

305
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you get the ammo?
- Yep</font>

306
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:23,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! What are you doing?</font>

307
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was Jeff's gun loaded
with blanks?</font>

308
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it?</font>

309
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:29,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agh! Okay!</font>

310
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, coming out.</font>

311
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

312
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.</font>

314
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">So once again, I'm the bad guy.</font>

315
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

316
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he got to win last year.</font>

317
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a game, Annie.
It's just...</font>

318
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:50,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

319
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a game.</font>

320
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's play.</font>

321
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it in your holster.</font>

322
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Annie.</font>

323
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my favorite.
I don't wanna beat you.</font>

324
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that I don't want
Jeff to be...</font>

325
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the gun in your holster,</font>

326
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let's play the game.</font>

327
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

328
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can shoot me
and play without me.</font>

329
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:16,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's this group's
favorite thing.</font>

330
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're always nice
to you, Pierce.</font>

331
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong.</font>

332
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong!</font>

333
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:23,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days ago,
I walked in on you guys</font>

334
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">playing cards without me.</font>

335
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:26,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days ago!</font>

336
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't playing cards.</font>

337
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were voting,
and you weren't invited</font>

338
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we were voting
about you.</font>

339
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:33,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

340
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were taking a vote...</font>

341
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">On whether we'd invite you
back to the group next year.</font>

342
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky for you,
it had to be unanimous.</font>

343
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was one holdout.</font>

344
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">One red card.</font>

345
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick it up.</font>

346
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black Rider...</font>

347
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:51,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Jeff Winger.</font>

348
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've heard
of me by now.</font>

349
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

350
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying.</font>

351
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you're half
the cool cowboy</font>

352
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:01,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">you pretend to be,</font>

353
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll respect that we've got</font>

354
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">a situation playing out here</font>

355
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let us be
until it's settled.</font>

356
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure thing.</font>

357
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once it's settled...</font>

358
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking out everybody
in this room.</font>

359
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

360
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:21,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting with you,
Mr. Insecure.</font>

361
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're good-looking,
but you're not.</font>

362
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're average.</font>

363
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just
an average-looking guy</font>

364
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a big chin.</font>

365
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on?
- He's faking it.</font>

366
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:55,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, something's wrong with him.</font>

367
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:56,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's fake.</font>

368
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:57,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last week he did it</font>

369
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get out of letting me have
a stick of gum.</font>

370
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's old, though.
Could be real.</font>

371
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real.
It is.</font>

372
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gurgling's a nice touch.</font>

373
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are terrible people.</font>

374
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah, we warned you.
- Buddy, are you all right?</font>

375
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to call 911?</font>

376
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:11,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sucker!</font>

377
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bich.</font>

378
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seriously?
- Told you, dude.</font>

379
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm the best!
- You're the worst.</font>

380
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out of the group?</font>

381
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're out of mine!</font>

382
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm winning!</font>

383
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:22,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've created a monster.</font>

384
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:24,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not give ourselves
too much credit.</font>

385
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:26,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out.</font>

386
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some old guy pretended
to have a heart attack.</font>

387
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:29,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shot me in the gut.</font>

388
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.
That's your problem.</font>

389
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">This school sucks.</font>

390
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:35,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then why do you go here?</font>

391
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't go to this toilet</font>

392
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my big sister's toe.</font>

393
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:40,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take a class online.</font>

394
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was paid to be here
and win the game</font>

395
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:43,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">so my boss could keep
his prize money.</font>

396
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:46,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work
for the ice cream company?</font>

397
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, this thing
is so much bigger</font>

398
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:49,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">than you can even imagine.</font>

399
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm outta here.</font>

400
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Coldplay tickets.</font>

401
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coldplay?</font>

402
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too late, bean allergy.</font>

403
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You blew it.</font>

404
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

405
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody?</font>

406
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone have an alliance
I can join?</font>

407
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really loyal.</font>

408
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I out?</font>

409
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your knees.</font>

410
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:35,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Greendale student
can be allowed</font>

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">to win this game.</font>

412
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Initiate plan B:
Operation Total Invasion.</font>

413
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale students,</font>

414
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:50,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you've unified,</font>

415
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">and intend
to draw this game out.</font>

416
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if it's a war you want,
it's a war you shall lose.</font>

417
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:01,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resistance is as pointless
as your degrees.</font>

418
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are we the little rascals?
- I was.</font>

419
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:08,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on your team!
Stop shooting me!</font>

420
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna lose this war,
and this school!</font>

421
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looks like this is it.
- We're dying out here!</font>

422
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:12,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a dream
it would end this way.</font>

423
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:13,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I'm gone, I'm gone.</font>

424
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess
I'll see you in hell.</font>

425
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:17,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just the tip
of the iceberg.</font>
