00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I go into the bathroom with Tom...</font>

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:06,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we both, you know... take 'em out.</font>

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I say, "Size more? Try size less."</font>

4
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:13,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna go to rehab and compare
penises with famous people.</font>

00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:18,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All in good time, kiddo.</font>

7
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:21,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, Pierce, we're very glad
to have you back.</font>

8
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:23,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assuming. You?</font>

9
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... What should we do now?</font>

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't wanna be that guy,</font>

11
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:33,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I guess we should start studying
Anthropology.</font>

12
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Um...</font>

00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:42,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chapter four.</font>

15
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello!
- Oh, thank God!</font>

16
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

18
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:49,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- What is it, dean?</font>

19
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:52,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, haha. I have exciting news.</font>

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vice president Joe Biden</font>

21
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been visiting community colleges
across the country</font>

22
00:00:56,706 --> 00:01:00,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">as part of his
"Biden Time Talkin' 'Bout Teachin'" tour.</font>

23
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, folksy, yet progressive.</font>

24
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">He does walk that line.</font>

25
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, his tour is taking him
to this neck of the woods,</font>

26
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:09,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">And at 5:00 P.M. today,
he is stopping by Greendale!</font>

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat that, city college and wash it down</font>

28
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:13,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a nice tall glass of suck it.</font>

29
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vice president is coming.</font>

30
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">That explains the people I've noticed</font>

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">covertly surveilling
the campus this week.</font>

32
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be Secret Service.</font>

33
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:22,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abed, will your reality ever
come out on Blu-Ray</font>

34
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">- so we can enjoy it?
- We've been made.</font>

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only problem: Mr. Biden is supposed
to be meeting</font>

36
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:29,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the dean...</font>

37
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:30,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the head of our student government,</font>

38
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:33,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">which in its current form doesn't exist.</font>

39
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we have seven hours
to elect a student president.</font>

40
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, what am I gonna wear?</font>

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I could borrow
my sister's Uncle Sam outfit.</font>

42
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's tailored for ladies</font>

43
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what else can I do
on such short notice?</font>

44
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:49,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you can not dress up like Uncle Sam.</font>

45
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or admit you don't have a sister.</font>

46
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're electing a student president.</font>

47
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna run!</font>

48
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have so many ideas
for improving the school.</font>

49
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Improving Greendale takes more
than ideas, Annie.</font>

50
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:01,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes time, gasoline, matches.</font>

51
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, nice.</font>

52
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, news flash, Jeff.
Some of us care about more</font>

53
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">than just fixing our hair
and sculpting our abs.</font>

54
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. You got me pegged.</font>

55
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Democracy. What a ruse.</font>

56
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no such thing as a system in which</font>

57
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:17,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the masses hold any...
- Everyone wants you to shut up.</font>

58
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,660

70
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,576

00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:31,613

I'm not the worker bee type.</font>

112
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">the campus was being observed?</font>

113
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I noticed because I'm
used to being the only observer.</font>

114
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're not used to being noticed.</font>

115
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,438

00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,255

<font color="#FFFFFF">for this bootleg of The Last Airbender.</font>

119
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:08,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you a week ago?</font>

120
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:13,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can keep it.</font>

121
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, another one makes the cut.</font>

122
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,491

130
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:44,566

131
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Hey, I got the heat, I gotta go.</font>

132
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,298

round of the debates,</font>

154

court the Hispanic vote.</font>

yourself right now, Abed.</font>

171

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's up with politics?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

172
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're precisely right, Troy.</font>

173
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I hear they're
getting ready to start,</font>

174
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we'll turn it over to
coverage of the debates.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

179
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:54,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

180
00:07:59,003 --> 00:07:59,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

181
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, knock it off.</font>

182
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not running sincerely.</font>

183
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not even interested
in student government.</font>

184
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, and yet, the people love me.</font>

185
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost as if politics
were a huge joke.</font>

186
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look.</font>

187
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I asked you to hang my fliers,</font>

188
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I suggest you drop out right now,</font>

189
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">because not only will I beat you,</font>

190
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will make you cry.</font>

191
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

192
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:20,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I feel a slight ego</font>

193
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">blowing in from the east.</font>

194
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna feel my foot
blowing in from the south.</font>

195

<font color="#FFFFFF">He owns a mattress store downtown.</font>

199
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:31,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can look it up.</font>

200
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Vicki.</font>

201
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:35,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst!</font>

202
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki, look at me. Psst!</font>

203
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:42,107

204
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:42,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that!</font>

205
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna eat your brains, Vicki.</font>

206
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna slurp 'em right out of that melon</font>

207
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:46,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">you call a head.</font>

208
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">A reminder to all candidates:</font>

209
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your microphones are currently on.</font>

210
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they better be,
'cause I'm on fire up here.</font>

211
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You freak people out, you know that?</font>

212
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look weird...</font>

213
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of your overbite.</font>

214
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:01,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's just get started.</font>

215
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the Greendale Community
College presidential debate.</font>

216
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Candidates, if elected, what will you do?</font>

217
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie?</font>

218
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:14,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm running on a platform
of school improvement.</font>

219
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm elected, the black mold</font>

220
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be removed from the east stairwell.</font>

221
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:21,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">The assailant known only
as "the asscrack bandit"</font>

222
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be brought to justice.</font>

223
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will balance the school's budget</font>

224
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">by eliminating administrative redundancies.</font>

225
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I'm in the room.</font>

226
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, miss Edison.</font>

227
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Winger?</font>

228
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's an important question.</font>

229
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's important to students like Jeremy,</font>

230
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:41,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">who told me today that he
is majoring in Astronomy</font>

231
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">and is supporting two children.</font>

232
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an important question to Maria,</font>

233
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's a beautiful Latina born in Nicaragua,</font>

234
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">working in the cafeteria.</font>

235
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will I do, dean?</font>

236
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, these people don't
want me to say what I'll do.</font>

237
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want me to do what I'll say.</font>

238
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:00,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

239
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">They love it when you
shuffle the words around.</font>

240
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magnitude?</font>

241
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop! Pop!</font>

242
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

243
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same question.</font>

244
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same answer.</font>

245
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop! Pop!</font>

246
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

247
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I ask you a few
questions, Mr. Nadir?</font>

248
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:21,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

249
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was there a specific reason</font>

250
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">you had to repeat the first grade?</font>

251
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, from what I'm told,</font>

252
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:26,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know how to use scissors,</font>

253
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sat in the middle of the seesaw,</font>

254
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I always found the distinction</font>

255
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">between duck and goose
to be very arbitrary.</font>

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't you just pick the
sixth kid every time?</font>

257
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:33,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I...</font>

258
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would have done.</font>

259
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went with four.</font>

260
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez, get a room, you two.</font>

261
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne, your platform?</font>

262
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:46,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">My platform will be one high enough</font>

263
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">to push Vicki off to her death.</font>

264
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

265
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:50,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vicki!</font>

266
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like Vicki is out of the race.</font>

267
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, then I am too.</font>

268
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:55,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only here to get back at her</font>

269
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:56,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">for not lending me a pencil.</font>

270
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Wow.</font>

271
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, well...</font>

272
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get back on track here?</font>

273
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:03,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to get the black mold</font>

274
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of the east stairwell.</font>

275
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:09,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to clean up Greendale.</font>

276
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:10,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying Greendale is dirty?</font>

277
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:13,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boo.</font>

278
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:14,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Boo.
- Well...</font>

279
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it's dirty.</font>

280
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows that.</font>

281
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't, Annie.</font>

282
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's clean.</font>

283
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:23,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's the cleanest school</font>

284
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the entire country.</font>

285
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:25,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it is.</font>

286
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Jeff Winger's really</font>

287
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">got this thing in the bag.</font>

288
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:28,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure does, Troy.</font>

289
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what you will about this or that,</font>

290
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">but people just like the guy.</font>

291
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read my lips...</font>

292
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what you're told...</font>

293
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to clean the mold.</font>

294
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:44,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what you're told...</font>

295
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to clean the mold!</font>

296
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, people!</font>

297
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter what you're told...</font>

298
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to clean the mold.</font>

299
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:52,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Yeah!</font>

300
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:54,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is interesting.</font>

301
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie Edison has reduced her platform</font>

302
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">to one issue and turned that
issue into a sound bite.</font>

303
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it rhymes and people love it.</font>

304
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">This election's become a real horse race.</font>

305
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to our polls,
the campus is almost</font>

00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:06,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">evenly divided.</font>

307
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:08,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now keep in mind the margin of error</font>

308
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">on this thing is about 98%.</font>

309
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be higher.</font>

310
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:11,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even know how
to do margins of error.</font>

311
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talked to two people
at a vending machine.</font>

312
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:14,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm being told we're
taking a quick break,</font>

313
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but stay tuned.
- They have to stay tuned.</font>

314
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:17,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's closed circuit television.
- Don't know what that means.</font>

315
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're out.</font>

316
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:21,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get an apple juice, please?</font>

317
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:24,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freshly squeezed this time
or so help me God, Maurice.</font>

321
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:39,681

323
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,029

00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,181

<font color="#FFFFFF">Fertilizer, car battery, PVC piping,</font>

327
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:52,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything suspicious.</font>

328
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you think I'm suspicious?</font>

329
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or because you wish I was suspicious,</font>

330
00:12:58,524 --> 00:12:59,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you would have an
excuse to see more of me.</font>

331
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:00,884

332
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you like me?
- That's not really relevant.</font>

333
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's close enough.</font>

334
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

335
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smell like nice soap.</font>

336
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:12,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll see.</font>

341
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my closing statement, I'm thinking</font>

342
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">about smashing a watermelon with a hammer.</font>

343
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, if I admit politics are stupid,</font>

344

trying to get something done.</font>

348
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,661

349
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're entitled to be president?</font>

350
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gloves are coming off.
You understand me?</font>

351
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:49,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an audio-visual presentation.</font>

352

354
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let us resume.</font>

355
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-burns, we haven't heard from you</font>

356

357
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I actually withdraw my candidacy.</font>

358
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear a political career will shine</font>

359
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">a negative light on my drug dealing.</font>

360
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,516

stops being about the issues,</font>

362
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,529

363
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your favorite color?</font>

364
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine's a three-way tie.</font>

366
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,050

367
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you know, dean.</font>

368
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop! Pop!</font>

369
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I set him up.</font>

370
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:36,024

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, that sounds interesting.</font>

372
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your presentation, Annie?</font>

373
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">My presentation is a copy of Jeff Winger's</font>

376
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just roll it. Thanks.</font>

377
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,490

386
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:16,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folks, who do you want
shaking Joe Biden's hand</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey, no!</font>

397
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!</font>

398
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey, no.</font>

399
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you in here?</font>

400
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,811

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

407
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know it would be that bad.</font>

408
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:09,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew.</font>

409
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't care.</font>

410
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,134

416
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I...</font>

417
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:32,360

425
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying you're missing it.</font>

426
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the political showdown of the century.</font>

427
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:47,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

428
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop! Pop!</font>

429
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,464

<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop! Pop!</font>

432
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have stayed in the running.</font>

433
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only real candidate.</font>

434
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was just another jerk
trying to win a contest.</font>

435
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right the whole time.</font>

436
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just couldn't admit it until I saw you</font>

437
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:07,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">running away crying.</font>

438
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay.</font>

439
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:11,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care what you think about me, you know?</font>

440
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I care what you think about me.</font>

441
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:16,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why this happened.</font>

442
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well...</font>

443
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:20,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resolved, then.</font>

444
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:22,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resolved.</font>

445
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we seek to destroy others,</font>

446
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">we often hurt our self.</font>

447
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:35,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it is the self that
wants to be destroyed.</font>

448
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you're not usually so poignant.</font>

449
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:41,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Vicki finally lent me her pencil.</font>

450
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! Pierce!</font>

451
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the health center!</font>

452
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

453
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've finally reached
the end of election road.</font>

454
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:52,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arguments have been made,
pops have been popped.</font>

455
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hearts have been stirred, perhaps broken.</font>

456
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that remains
is to tally the vote</font>

457
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,030

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how hard is it to
get rid of black mold?</font>

479
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we need, buckets and sponges?</font>

480
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't actually know.</font>

488
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:09,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For real?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

489
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too. Aww.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

497
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you say that?</font>

that we can give you?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">next time you're in town.</font>

514
