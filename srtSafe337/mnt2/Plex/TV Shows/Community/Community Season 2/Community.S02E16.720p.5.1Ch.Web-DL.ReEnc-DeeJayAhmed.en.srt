3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently they found him unconscious</font>

00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:07,764

<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know. We just got here.</font>

8
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's ready for visitors now.</font>

9
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in 10-23.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

11
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, welcome, my old friends.</font>

12
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Welcome.
- Pierce, what happened?</font>

13
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were all so worried.</font>

14
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the pills.</font>

15
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:28,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just took me over.</font>

16
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:31,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw awful, horrible things.
Demons, aliens,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what are you guys doing?</font>

19
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ok, just act natural.</font>

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce asked me to document his life</font>

21
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:44,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">for historical purposes.</font>

22
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:46,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first, I said, "no," because at the risk</font>

23
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">of sounding overly sensitive,
I feel intensely bored</font>

24
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">by Pierce as a subject.</font>

25
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:51,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm excited about
the narrative facility</font>

26
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the documentary format.</font>

27
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's easier to tell a complex story</font>

28
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you can just cut to people</font>

29
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:56,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">explaining things to the camera.</font>

30

31
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,557

- No, dummy.</font>

37
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,659

38
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:16,362

00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:19,055

it's become apparent</font>

00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:21,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">how little respect this group has for me.</font>

41
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:26,277

52
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:09,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when he had the hiccups</font>

53
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pulled the fire alarm?</font>

54

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

82
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you some things from the gift shop</font>

83
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:07,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">to cheer you up.</font>

84
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you a John Grisham novel</font>

85
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a funny little coffee mug.</font>

86
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see how the flea's door mat
says "Dog, sweet dog"?</font>

87
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Shirley, we both know</font>

88
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you and I are the most hated
in the group.</font>

89
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:18,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do?</font>

90
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:21,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">And since, in my absence,
you'll be the new black sheep...</font>

91
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. That's offensive.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Black swan.</font>

93
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to have this.</font>

94
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a compact record and it</font>

95
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">contains an audio file of your study group</font>

96
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about you while
you're out of the room.</font>

97
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all here, burnt into this diskette</font>

98
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">by optical lasers.</font>

99
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe you.</font>

100
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it sounds like science fiction.</font>

101
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't believe
there's anything on that.</font>

102
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:46,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess this is good-bye... Forever.</font>

103
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good... good-bye, Pierce.</font>

104
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smell you later.</font>

105
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it's a recording of you all</font>

106
00:03:58,132 --> 00:03:59,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking behind my back.</font>

107
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous.</font>

108
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I told him,</font>

109
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you all don't do that.</font>

110
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

111
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:12,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Hawthorne is requesting "sour face."</font>

112
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock, knock.</font>

113
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you, Death?</font>

114
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:20,711

- Oh.</font>

115
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you speak, I just want to tell you</font>

116
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:23,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you don't have to give me anything.</font>

117
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:26,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am happy to just spend time with you.</font>

118
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what Dylan Thomas
said about death?</font>

119
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, tell me.</font>

120
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, bluff called.</font>

121
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're the selfless one
in the group, right?</font>

122
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't know.
I haven't thought about myself in years.</font>

123
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what makes you
the perfect recipient</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">of this bequeathment.</font>

125
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a check for $10,000</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">with the payee line blank,</font>

127
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you can give it
to the charity of your choice.</font>

128
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

129
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, this is... surprising.</font>

130
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:52,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">After what you gave Shirley,</font>

131
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">we thought you were playing mind games.</font>

132
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

133
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, if you are so inclined,</font>

134
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could always write
your own name in there.</font>

135

<font color="#FFFFFF">Toodles.</font>

136
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to die in a place like this.</font>

137
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">People shouldn't die in the same place</font>

138
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">as People magazines do.</font>

139
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:14,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope to die surrounded by my family.</font>

140
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the only way I agreed to be</font>

141
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">surrounded by my family.</font>

142
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:18,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and Abed have an agreement.</font>

143
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">If one of us dies, we stage it to look</font>

144
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a suicide caused
by the unjust cancellation</font>

145
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Firefly.</font>

146
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get that show back
on the air, buddy.</font>

147
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd it go?</font>

148
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:29,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

149
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fine.</font>

150
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave me a check for $10,000</font>

151
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give to the charity of my choice.</font>

152
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:35,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? He's not messing with us.</font>

153
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe he just hates Shirley.
- What?</font>

154
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe.</font>

155
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to research a few charities,</font>

156
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:43,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">because some take a lot off the top</font>

157
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you think you're giving money to people</font>

158
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">that really need it,
and you're really giving it</font>

159
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">to some middle man
who's gonna pay off their parking tickets,</font>

160
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">credit cards, and keep
from getting kicked out</font>

161
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:56,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">of her place in... April.</font>

162
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

163
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd like to see Annie next.</font>

164
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:00,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? No.</font>

165
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll see Jeff next.</font>

166
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but you're not supposed to go...</font>

167
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what? You'll do twice
as much work as a doctor</font>

168
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">for half the pay?</font>

169
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you?</font>

170
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called a complisult.</font>

171
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:10,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Part compliment, part insult.</font>

172
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">He invented them. I coined the term.</font>

173
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what I just did there?</font>

174
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was an explanabrag.</font>

175
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:18,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeffrey.</font>

176
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:19,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.</font>

177
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:25,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've thought about this day many times,</font>

178
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've always imagined it differently.</font>

179
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">For starters, I thought
you'd be the one in bed</font>

180
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd be a hologram.</font>

181
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:32,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

182
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, never mind.
There's no time for that now.</font>

183
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, it's starting to seem,</font>

184
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">from observing the others,
that you're using</font>

185
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:45,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">the social leverage afforded you
by your alleged deathbed</font>

186
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">to exact complicated acts
of psychological vengeance</font>

187
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">on those closest to you.</font>

188
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vengeance? Oh, no.</font>

189
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never one to hold a grudge, Jeffrey.</font>

190
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father held grudges.</font>

191
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll always hate him for that.</font>

192
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get along with your father?</font>

193
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got along without him.</font>

194
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's no good, Jeffrey.</font>

195
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want your dad to die</font>

196
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">before you tell him how you feel.</font>

197
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're right.</font>

198
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, let's nip this in the bud.</font>

199
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, we're sorry we didn't respond</font>

200
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">quickly enough to your pill addiction.</font>

201
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:13,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any chance that apology is enough?</font>

202
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:16,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready to be
bequeathed upon, Jeff?</font>

203
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

204
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blow my mind.</font>

205
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found your father.</font>

206
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you now?</font>

207
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:27,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">William Winger, born Oklahoma City, 1945.</font>

208
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">1974, married Doreen Fitzgerald.</font>

209
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Divorced in 1983.</font>

210
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most recently residing in Dorchester.</font>

211
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:36,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Currently sitting in a town car on its way</font>

212
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">to this very hospital.</font>

213
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should be here in an hour or so,</font>

214
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">give or take a father.</font>

215
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:44,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it?</font>

216
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:45,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

217
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:46,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

218
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at the funeral.</font>

219
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:53,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so it is bequeathed.</font>

220
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:02,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna say to your dad?</font>

221
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna say anything
because I won't have to,</font>

222
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Pierce is playing
head games with us.</font>

223
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided not to listen to it.</font>

224
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

225
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna listen to the CD</font>

226
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">of you guys talking about me.</font>

227
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I forgive you.</font>

228
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how do we know
what we're being forgiven for?</font>

229
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even know what's on there.</font>

230
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you never have to.</font>

231
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

232
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if he is coming, though?</font>

233
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna say to him?</font>

234
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. I'll be him. I'll be him.</font>

235
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:34,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Hey.</font>

236
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Jeff's dad. Hi.</font>

237
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Hi, Jeff's dad.</font>

238
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Britta's dad.</font>

239
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? Why?
- I don't know.</font>

240
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got drunk, didn't have a condom,</font>

241
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:44,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">and her mom gets freaky
when she hears oingo boingo.</font>

242
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I wish I could relate,</font>

243
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">but much like my son,
I'm a closet homosexual.</font>

244
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:48,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't apologize for that.</font>

245
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking to the guy
that banged Britta's mom.</font>

246
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no standards.</font>

247
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you say we take a tumble?</font>

248
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:54,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll put on a wig.</font>

249
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. You're under arrest.</font>

250
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:56,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an undercover cop.</font>

251
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:57,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not illegal to be gay.</font>

252
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is here in Iran.</font>

253
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not when we're in the green zone.</font>

254
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Iraq, stupid.</font>

255
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do I know?</font>

256
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jeff Winger's dumb, gay dad.</font>

257
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was a two-bit con man</font>

258
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:11,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">of so little substance
he couldn't leave a trail</font>

259
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he wanted to.</font>

260
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't care if Pierce
hired Scotland Yard.</font>

261
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">He isn't gonna track him down
from a hospital bed.</font>

262
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, money can't just
make people appear.</font>

263
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:21,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

264
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for Troy Barnes.</font>

265
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne sent me.</font>

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Troy?</font>

267
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

268
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:37,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Levar Burton.</font>

269
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce got Levar Burton
to come here for Troy?</font>

270
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anyone he can't produce?</font>

271
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm really getting mad.</font>

272
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I the only one
he decided to torture?</font>

273
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told Pierce a thousand times</font>

274
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never wanted to meet Levar in person!</font>

275
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted a picture!</font>

276
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:07,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't disappoint a picture!</font>

277
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you, Pierce!</font>

278
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you so much!</font>

279
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahem.</font>

280
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I forgive you.</font>

281
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie Edison.</font>

282
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your bequeathal is at hand.</font>

283
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a regular job here?</font>

284
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I know you're being strong for me.</font>

285
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give you permission to weep.</font>

286
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm crying on the inside.</font>

287
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gross.</font>

288
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in any case,</font>

289
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:42,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to give you this.</font>

290
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been in my family for six generations.</font>

291
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:47,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's yours.</font>

292
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

293
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, do you want to see your dad?</font>

294
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not coming.
- But do you want to see him?</font>

295
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

296
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why aren't you leaving?</font>

297
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:17,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't care and I'm not</font>

298
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">gonna let him think that I care.</font>

299
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad or Pierce?</font>

300
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no dad.</font>

301
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get this thing out of my face!</font>

302
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't you dare intercut this</font>

303
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">with footage of me freaking out.</font>

304
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

305
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there footage of you freaking out?</font>

306
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I'm gonna kill you</font>

307
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:38,005

312
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,538

give me that CD.</font>

- We're gonna listen to it.</font>

353
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:14,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, wait.</font>

356
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't learn anything without me.</font>

357
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how much do we all hate Shirley?</font>

358
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, knock it off.</font>

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, James Bond, stop trying to record us</font>

360
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">with that stupid spy pen.</font>

361
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can see the blinking light.</font>

362
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you keep trying to record us</font>

363
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">bad-mouthing each other?</font>

364
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he thinks friendship
is a competition</font>

365
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's always trying
to get the upper hand.</font>

366
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think Shirley's any different?</font>

367
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Moron.</font>

368
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:43,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello!</font>

369
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we do owe you an apology, Shirley.</font>

370
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't have said
those things about you.</font>

371
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:55,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the lesson here is</font>

372
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I sometimes use guilt as a weapon.</font>

373
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

374
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just shooting a talking head</font>

375
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">or did you want me to be the only one</font>

376
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">who didn't have one?</font>

377
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:08,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, go ahead.</font>

378
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:13,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it stems from when I was...</font>

379
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you found my father?</font>

380
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he's on his way.</font>

381
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if this is too much to handle,</font>

382
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:25,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I completely understand
and I can call it off.</font>

383
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I think I'm ready to see him.</font>

384
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Good for you.</font>

385
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:34,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I should probably tell you...</font>

386
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're lying to me,
if my father isn't coming,</font>

387
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">if a car pulls up and
anyone other than my father</font>

388
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">steps out...
say, an actor or you in a wig...</font>

389
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you try to pull any Ferris Bueller,</font>

392
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,967

00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:53,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there will be nothing
madcap or wacky about it.</font>

394
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:55,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understood?</font>

395
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crystal.</font>

396
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,407

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Levar.
- Oh, I know.</font>

398
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a huge fan of Rebop.</font>

399
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was cancelled before I was born,</font>

400
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I scored some VHS copies.</font>

401
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:21,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was nostalgic from a very early age.</font>

402
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:22,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

403
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you know, I assumed
that Troy was a fan,</font>

404
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he hasn't said a word
to me since I got here</font>

405
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I've got to catch this flight.</font>

406
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! You can't go.</font>

407
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:31,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loves you.</font>

408
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">He talks about you all the time.</font>

409
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much would it cost
to change your flight till tomorrow?</font>

410
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is, um, $261 enough?</font>

411
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:40,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause that's all I've got.</font>

412
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:43,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's all you've got?
- Yeah.</font>

413
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you... you keep your money.</font>

414
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll... I'll reschedule.</font>

415
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Thank you.</font>

416
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna be so happy.</font>

417
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you are a very generous friend,</font>

418
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're really stupid with your money.</font>

419
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that I'm selfish.</font>

420
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:04,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that I'm really stupid
with my money,</font>

421
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I'll never have a lot of it</font>

422
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:08,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">and because I'm a really generous friend.</font>

423
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Problem solved.</font>

424
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:11,666

425
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta for the win!</font>

426
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God he didn't take it.</font>

427
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you imagine bouncing
a check to Kunta Kinte?</font>

428
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:46,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

429
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, this is your father.</font>

430
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh?</font>

431
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me here in this sedan.</font>

432
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? I'm waving.</font>

433
00:16:57,153 --> 00:17:00,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I can't come any closer, my boy.</font>

434
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is too difficult.</font>

435
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look too much like your mother.</font>

436
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Don't come any closer.</font>

437
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you were.</font>

438
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, have to catch a flight to Katmandu,</font>

439
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I just wanted to say
cherish the new friends</font>

440
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you've made.</font>

441
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're your true family now!</font>

442
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Don't open it!</font>

443
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be too hard for both of us!</font>

444
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:21,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Jeff!
- Jeff!</font>

445
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Son of a...!
- Oh, no!</font>

446
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Jeff!</font>

447
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no!</font>

448
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you improvise a plan,</font>

449
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes you hit a speed bump.</font>

450
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sometimes you hit it so hard</font>

451
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:36,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you soar through the air,</font>

452
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">far beyond your initial expectations.</font>

453
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I set out to take revenge on Jeff Winger,</font>

454
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:44,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">to scare him with the ghost of his father.</font>

455
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, I took over
the role of his father,</font>

456
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">and helped make him a better man.</font>

457
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a long time before Jeff Winger</font>

458
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">underestimates me again.</font>

459
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, no!</font>

460
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you do something like this?</font>

461
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff! Come on, Jeff!</font>

462
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm sick of you people</font>

463
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">not taking me seriously!</font>

464
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You forget my birthday!</font>

465
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:13,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't invite me
to your Dungeons and Dragons games</font>

466
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">or your secret trampoline!</font>

467
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys think I'm some kind of a joke!</font>

468
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't disproving the theory!</font>

469
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:24,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good point.</font>

470
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you say? What'd you say?</font>

471
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

472
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:31,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently I need to say
some things to my father.</font>

473
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:35,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things that I may have screamed
at Pierce instead.</font>

474
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.</font>

475
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my father deserves it too.</font>

476
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

477
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured out your test.</font>

478
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:51,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crowns, presents, punishments, favorites.</font>

479
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to show me the dangers</font>

480
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">of my own elitism.</font>

481
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">My constant striving to be the best.</font>

482
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:01,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm requeathing this tiara.</font>

483
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if I become the kind of person</font>

484
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">who thinks it's their place
to pick favorites</font>

485
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">and torture the rest,
I'll die sad and alone.</font>

486
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what you were trying
to teach me.</font>

487
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Annie.</font>

488
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pass.</font>

489
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's actually just my favorite.</font>

490
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I thought the documentary format</font>

491
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be like fish in a barrel,</font>

492
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:35,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">but as is the case
with a real barrel of fish,</font>

493
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:36,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">after a while, it can become cramped,</font>

494
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">chaotic, and stinky.</font>

495
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">In their floor and bats...</font>

496
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately, if in the end,
your documentary is turning out</font>

497
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">just as messy as real life,</font>

498
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:45,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can always wrap it up with a series</font>

499
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">of random shots, which when cut together</font>

500
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">under a generic voice-over,</font>

501
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">suggest a profound thematic connection.</font>

502
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not knocking it.</font>

503
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">It works.</font>

504
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys.</font>

505
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:04,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

506
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:05,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

507
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:10,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff and I became...</font>

508
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of like father and son today.</font>

509
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we did not.</font>

510
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I am telling you, man,</font>

511
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:22,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">this salmon is really good.</font>

512
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind passing me the pepper?</font>

513
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪</font>

514
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I can go twice as high ♪</font>

515
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ take a look ♪</font>

516
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ it's in a book ♪</font>

517
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ the reading rainbow ♪</font>

518
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:58,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, more fish for Kunta.</font>
