to enrollment then?</font>

15
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:44,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can launch our
own space simulator.</font>

their launch on Monday,</font>

can we go inside?</font>

82
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,591

<font color="#FFFFFF">five seconds after the Dean left.</font>

85
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

86
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more beautiful

87

<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we can't be in here.</font>

93
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then get out.</font>

94
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:07,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, it's pretty well preserved</font>

95
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">for something that
survived the '80s...</font>

96
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">And apparently a local transient</font>

from the dorm.</font>

102
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, seriously,</font>

103
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to ask that we
all step out of here.</font>

104
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:26,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what, you're gonna tattle on us</font>

105
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:27,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you did with the flag?</font>

106
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't tattle about the flag,</font>

107
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you shouldn't have
made it in the first place.</font>

108

why don't you marry it?</font>

take a mental step backwards</font>

136
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">and realize we are
simply in a winnebago</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">That place deserves an anus flag.</font>

154
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can anyone get a phone signal?</font>

155
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No.</font>

156
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:50,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine's working,
but it's the black guy</font>

157
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:51,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the wrong number again.</font>

158
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I keep telling
you that that is an iPod</font>

159
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:57,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are listening to
Wesley Snipe's audiobook.</font>

160
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he sure hates
the government.</font>

161
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a long shot.</font>

162
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:05,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe if I do this,
it will solve everything.</font>

163
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

164
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all my fault.</font>

165
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very much so.
- Oh!</font>

166
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, when you go fishing,
sometimes you catch a boot.</font>

167
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where... Re... You...</font>

168
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tel... Where... You are!</font>

169
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:25,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

170
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:28,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you hoodlums?
Bring my spaceship back!</font>

171
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we are...</font>

172
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:34,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">40 light years outside
of the buttermilk nebula,</font>

173
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">although it is possible...</font>

174
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:39,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's a sticker.</font>

175
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, terrible Dean.</font>

176
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing is being
towed with us in it.</font>

177
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh. Okay, wait.</font>

178
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">So handicap spots
count on saturdays?</font>

179
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:52,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assuming we don't wind
up in a compactor,</font>

180
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we get back,
I'm going to step on you.</font>

181
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, as much as I might
enjoy that, Jeffrey,</font>

182
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't get back here
in time for the launch,</font>

183
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">City College wins,</font>

184
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Greendale becomes just
another school on my resume</font>

185
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">that no one can call,
because it doesn't exist.</font>

186
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, tell me where you are!</font>

187
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a moving canister
with no phone and no GPS,</font>

188
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the only
window is sealed shut.</font>

189
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:17,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hel... hello?</font>

190
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

191
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't sealed shut.</font>

192
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:23,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

193
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">The window isn't sealed shut.</font>

194
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It slides open when you
complete the simulation.</font>

195
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can you talk
them through it?</font>

196
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, if they can
open that window,</font>

197
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">they can tell us where they are,
and we can find them.</font>

198
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed to
be on that thing.</font>

199
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how she works.</font>

200
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:44,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. That's why they need
you to bring her home.</font>

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get us some coffee.</font>

202
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy.
- Abed?</font>

203
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get that window open
by doing the simulation.</font>

204
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the panel on your right</font>

205
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... and tell me your recipe.
- Original.</font>

206
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:11,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many pieces?
- 6</font>

207
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:12,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Flavor heading?
- Tasty.</font>

208
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get it up to delicious.</font>

209
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes sense.</font>

210
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent work, Captain.</font>

211
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now keep your herbs
and spices balanced</font>

212
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">while the crew helps
you with teamwork.</font>

213
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we can get the window open</font>

214
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you man your terminals,
and we complete the simulation.</font>

215
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:30,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I got a better idea.</font>

216
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:32,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Jeffrey!</font>

217
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all dying.</font>

218
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:38,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all gonna die!</font>

219
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:42,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">My readings indicate the
need for cooperation.</font>

220
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:43,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate to pull rank on you,</font>

221
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I need you to man
your station now, Jeff.</font>

222
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate to pull reality on you,</font>

223
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:49,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you got your rank, Captain,</font>

224
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:52,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">by sitting in the chair
with the largest knobs!</font>

225
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">My readings indicate Pierce...</font>

226
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Pierce...</font>

227
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">My readings indicate</font>

228
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're going to die alone.</font>

229
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why's he saying that?
Why's he...</font>

230
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">why's he saying that to me?</font>

231
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:08,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, he... he's getting worse.</font>

232
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost there.</font>

233
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop talking, old man.</font>

234
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't make me stop, Pierce,</font>

235
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Troy is killing
your life force.</font>

236
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I knew it!
- Oh!</font>

237
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it!</font>

238
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:27,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

239
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kentucky one...</font>

240
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:33,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you read me?</font>

241
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kentucky one, Kentucky one,
do you read me?</font>

242
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kentucky one, copy.</font>

243
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kentucky. Come in, Kentucky.</font>

244
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've worked out a way for
them to reroute the power</font>

245
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the auxiliary battery.
Reroute to what?</font>

246
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody...</font>

247
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here is the situation.</font>

248
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Greendale.</font>

249
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the maximum
distance from Greendale</font>

250
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can drive to haul
them back up here in time</font>

251
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the simulated launch.</font>

252
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these are city impound lots...</font>

253
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of which might
be their destination.</font>

254
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are these other circles?</font>

255
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What other circles?</font>

256
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:13,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you circled
public restrooms</font>

257
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">and truck stops. Yeah.</font>

258
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another one. - Okay.</font>

259
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a different
side of the map,</font>

260
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that is...
for a different project.</font>

261
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they have star ratings?</font>

262
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's get to work, people!
- Got it.</font>

263
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to me, Buddy. Come on!</font>

264
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, bro, we stopped moving.</font>

265
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce has got space madness,
or he's just old or something.</font>

266
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're locking him
up in the back.</font>

267
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Argh!
- Run, Jeff!</font>

268
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:38,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do this to me!</font>

269
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just did!</font>

270
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, please!
You're becoming animals!</font>

271
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shut up!</font>

272
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.</font>

273
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:46,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true!</font>

274
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't supposed to be
in here when it happened!</font>

275
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">When what happened?</font>

276
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we got towed?</font>

277
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know we
were gonna get towed?</font>

278
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I set it up.</font>

279
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I called City College
about transferring,</font>

280
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:08,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Dean told me
that he would get me in</font>

281
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I helped sabotage
Greendale's launch.</font>

282
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed to make
sure nobody was around</font>

283
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that they could steal it.</font>

284
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:15,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you guys were late,
and then...</font>

285
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:17,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait. You're transferring?</font>

286
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:18,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

287
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:23,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys thought that
butthole flag was so funny.</font>

288
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:26,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I respect you all enough
to let you hate yourselves,</font>

289
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I respect myself too much
to let you hate my school.</font>

290
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh. I'm not buying it.</font>

291
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:34,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

292
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:36,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's kill her.</font>

293
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:38,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! City College was behind this?</font>

294
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:43,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get back in
time for that launch.</font>

295
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- We earned the right</font>

296
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:47,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pick on Greendale
every day by going there.</font>

297
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our school may be a toilet,
but it's our toilet.</font>

298
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nobody craps in it but us.
- Yeah.</font>

299
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:56,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, that was inspiring.
- Seriously?</font>

300
00:12:59,225 --> 00:12:59,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain.</font>

301
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to your stations.</font>

302
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:03,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

303
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thrusters.

318
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are in...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're out of town.</font>

327
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess somebody'll
come get us eventually.</font>

328
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really miss Greendale.</font>

329
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:04,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many schools would let
you make a butt flag...</font>

330
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:06,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then actually fly it?</font>

331
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:08,053

let you get a degree</font>

335
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:15,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody should have to choose</font>

336
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,698

337
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

338
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you shouldn't have
tattled about the flag.</font>

339
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:23,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tattled.</font>

340
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told the Dean it was our design.</font>

341
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I told him it was a butt too.</font>

342
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Why, Jeffrey?</font>

343
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:33,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kept not seeing it.
I mean, it was driving me crazy.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It says "e pluribus anus".</font>

345
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you we should
have put cheeks on it.</font>

346
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:40,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a time and
place for subtlety,</font>

347
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that time was
before Scary movie.</font>

348
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys?</font>

349
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm feeling a lot better now.</font>

350
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you... you sound good.</font>

351
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know, in a weird way,</font>

352
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">being in a smaller
place like this,</font>

353
00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:54,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was able to work
through some things.</font>

354
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm ready to come out.</font>

355
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you!</font>

356
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill you, Sanders!</font>

357
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,667

358
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,172

359
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

360
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,100

363
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean? The press is here.</font>

364
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:40,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh...
- I tried to buy us some time</font>

365
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:41,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">with these double-icious
sandwiches,</font>

366
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:44,581

product integration for KFC.</font>

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">This hawaiian bread
is so good, though.</font>

368
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,269

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised to see you here.</font>

372
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think I'd miss your
moment of triumph, do you?</font>

00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were behind this?</font>

00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next time you
provoke City College,</font>

379
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:21,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will lose more

00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can call off the rescue.</font>

383
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,213

384

I can't imagine anything</font>
