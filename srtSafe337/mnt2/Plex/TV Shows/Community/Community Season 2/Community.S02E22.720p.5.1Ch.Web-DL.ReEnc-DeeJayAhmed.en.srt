<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're <i>so</i> natural.</font>

152
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh-oh. Okay. Oh, boy.</font>

153
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can someone please get
every mop on campus?</font>

154
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, did you break water?
Is that broken water?</font>

155
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:45,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's broken water!
- Chang baby!</font>

156
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just nice and easy, careful...</font>

157
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:53,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, father, God almighty,
this isn't happening.</font>

158
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too soon.</font>

159
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want
my baby's first memory</font>

160
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to be star-burns.
- Oh, goodness. Ok, alright.</font>

161
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:02,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a big deal. Wait.
I mean, it is a big deal.</font>

162
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just not a big bad deal.
It's a big good deal.</font>

163
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could have everyone's
attention...</font>

164
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:08,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually would like not
to have your attention.</font>

165
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, give me your attention.</font>

166
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">This student is having a baby.
What am I talking about?</font>

167
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already know.</font>

168
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, here's...
Okay, here's what it is.</font>

169
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get my Prius,</font>

170
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna pull around the back,</font>

171
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna drive her
to the hospital.</font>

172
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drive a Prius,
which I think is pretty cool.</font>

173
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dean, go!
- Okay, dean gone.</font>

174
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you please call Andre?</font>

175
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's "Sugar Boots" in my phone.</font>

176
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:29,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hurts, Shirley.</font>

177
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, I'll get it
because I am here for you.</font>

178
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">We came so close
to having one class</font>

179
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">that wasn't all about them.</font>

180
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when they all took
that fishing trip</font>

181
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">on St. Patrick's Day?</font>

182
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, that was a good week.</font>

183
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has got
to be a Chang baby.</font>

184
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Changs are never born
in hospitals.</font>

185
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">More like taxicabs,
hardware stores,</font>

186
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">bank lines, sewers.</font>

187
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">My nephew Jin
was born on a treadmill</font>

188
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">at bally total fitness.</font>

189
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">20% incline.</font>

190
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:56,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sugar Boots" says that he'll
meet us at the hospital.</font>

191
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Now can somebody
do something about him?</font>

192
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying nobody needs
to freak out.</font>

193
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Chang is hearty to the core.
We always come out healthy.</font>

194
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there's like
a billion of us.</font>

195
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever tried googling me?
Can't be done!</font>

196
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, you have to stop
freaking her out.</font>

197
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:11,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, show me some respect.</font>

198
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be that child's
estranged father.</font>

199
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:17,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, what's it gonna be?
- What?</font>

200
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to buy the rights
to your handshake.</font>

201
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we have a deal?</font>

202
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, we're about to take
Shirley to the hospital.</font>

203
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the time.</font>

204
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's the time.</font>

205
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to my watch,
it's 1,000 o'clock.</font>

206
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Deal.
- Deal.</font>

207
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

208
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So how does it work?
- I don't know.</font>

209
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:35,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just kind of do it</font>

210
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:37,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">when one of us
says something awesome.</font>

211
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:40,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- All right. Betty Grable.</font>

212
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:45,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said Betty Grable.</font>

213
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Yes.</font>

214
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:03,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Do it.</font>

215
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make your money, whore.</font>

216
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Betty Grable?</font>

217
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:16,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's the stuff.</font>

218
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to take deep breaths
and relax.</font>

219
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is the dean?
- Oh, my God!</font>

220
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:24,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Everything's wet!</font>

221
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eew!
- Oh. Oh, that's okay.</font>

222
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:28,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay, because it is natural.</font>

223
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's natural.</font>

224
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you uncomfortable, Britta?</font>

225
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You wish.
- Oh!</font>

226
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. Okay. Ooh.
- $400. $500.</font>

227
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a million bucks
in dog dollars.</font>

228
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word.</font>

229
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Something's off.</font>

230
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:51,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like buying candy
from a baby.</font>

231
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?
You ruined it!</font>

232
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:54,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, give him back the money.</font>

233
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
Money doesn't matter anymore.</font>

234
00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you've sold something out,
you can't get it back.</font>

235
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you didn't even like
our handshake!</font>

236
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:03,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated it.
Now it's gone.</font>

237
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:07,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two are dumber
than Jackie Coogan.</font>

238
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">He divorced to Betty Grable.</font>

239
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Pierce tainted
our special handshake</font>

240
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:16,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">with his blood money</font>

241
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now we can't get
the magic back!</font>

242
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap.
You two for real?</font>

243
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

244
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares
about your stupid handshake.</font>

245
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">A baby is coming out
of Shirley's vagina</font>

246
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- two feet from us.
- Don't worry.</font>

247
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her contractions are still
six minutes apart.</font>

248
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">So unless her cervix is dilated
more than eight centimeters,</font>

249
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:32,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">we still have time
to get her to a hospital.</font>

250
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:35,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I delivered a baby
earlier this year</font>

251
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the back of an SUV.</font>

252
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Hmm-hmm.</font>

253
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was I when that happened?</font>

254
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Off in the background.</font>

255
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you pull your car up?
- Uh, <i>no.</i></font>

256
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's been overturned!
- What?</font>

257
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:49,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look, I don't want
to alarm anyone,</font>

258
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the world food festival
has taken a dark turn.</font>

259
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess some national
ethnicities</font>

260
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:56,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't play nice with others</font>

261
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">and things have turned
into a bit of a race...</font>

262
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kerfuffle.
- You mean riot?</font>

263
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, let's use kerfuffle
for now, okay, Mr. Winger?</font>

264
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:10,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just trying
to feed hungry foodies.</font>

265
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:11,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to call an ambulance.</font>

266
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's ambulances
out there!</font>

267
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're overturning those too!</font>

268
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I didn't even know
there was a difference</font>

269
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">between North
and South Korean barbeque.</font>

270
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, <i>M*A*S*H</i> lasted longer
than that war.</font>

271
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get over it. Am I right?
Don't print that.</font>

272
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:29,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just quit jotting.
Stop writing!</font>

273
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, 911 says it's gonna take
over an hour</font>

274
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of a race kerfuffle.</font>

275
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lake Woebegone. Eeh!</font>

276
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what do we do?</font>

277
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley,
pretend I'm saying this</font>

278
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a soothing, reassuring,
non-robotic voice.</font>

279
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going to make it
to the hospital.</font>

280
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.</font>

281
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to have this baby
in a hospital</font>

282
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my husband and the father
of my baby.</font>

283
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:48,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless that father is me.</font>

284
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">In which case,
what you need to do now</font>

285
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:52,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">is elevate your legs
over your head</font>

286
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:54,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">while facing the northeast
corner of the room.</font>

287
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">But try not to look
at the door, okay?</font>

288
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bad luck and Chang babies
are very superstitious.</font>

289
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also if you can visualize
a rabbit riding a dragon,</font>

290
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">it'll increase his chances
of winning lotteries.</font>

291
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:08,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, corner.</font>

292
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Shirley, we're having
the baby right here, right now.</font>

293
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:14,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

294
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, get every blanket
and coat you can find.</font>

295
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:17,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything soft for Shirley
to lie on.</font>

296
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:19,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I need you to call Andre</font>

297
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell him
to meet us here instead.</font>

298
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, what can I do?
- Stop rubbing her shoulders.</font>

299
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:26,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Being natural.</font>

300
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, help me move Shirley
to the ground.</font>

301
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
just stand right here.</font>

302
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:34,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy. Easy.
Troy, blankets. There we go.</font>

303
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

304
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:36,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to take a look</font>

305
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:37,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see how far along you are.</font>

306
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I'm sorry, Abed.</font>

307
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't feel comfortable
with you taking a grand tour</font>

308
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:41,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">of my nethers.</font>

309
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd prefer
it was one of the girls.</font>

310
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do it! I can do it!
I'm good at looking!</font>

311
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:48,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for you, Shirley.
Okay, what do I do?</font>

312
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you just need to look
and see if the baby's head</font>

313
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:54,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">- has reached the cervix.
- No problowe, Rob Lowe.</font>

314
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it the head has reached the cervix.</font>

315
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, okay, oh God, alright.</font>

316
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to worry. This kind of thing
happens all the time.</font>

317
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are a lot of babies born
in classrooms?</font>

318
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, a lot more are conceived.</font>

319
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Paul, that's off the record
and not true. Sort of.</font>

320
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:31,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie.
- Got to go.</font>

321
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:33,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, okay, due to an unforeseen conflict</font>

322
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">of genitals, I've been disqualified</font>

323
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:35,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">from delivering Shirley's baby</font>

324
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm gonna have to walk you through it.</font>

325
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't deliver a baby.</font>

326
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:39,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not properly prepared.</font>

327
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to take a class,
or read a book,</font>

328
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:43,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">or shadow a nurse, or at least
have my mom hug me first.</font>

329
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm seeing spots.</font>

330
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my lord, my lord,</font>

331
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:48,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">why are you doing
these things to me?</font>

332
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">How have I failed you?</font>

333
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, someone's got
to calm her down.</font>

334
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this.
Shirley, look at me.</font>

335
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at my face.</font>

336
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:02,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connect with me.</font>

337
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ha ha ha ha ha ♪</font>

338
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What in the hell?
- I don't know what to do!</font>

339
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:09,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chang! Where's Chang?
- What's up, baby?</font>

340
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:11,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said Chang babies
all come this way?</font>

341
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like a bullet from a gun.</font>

342
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And they're all okay?
- Hell, yeah.</font>

343
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than okay.
Super babies.</font>

344
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven generations
of little scrappers</font>

345
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:22,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">born in the worst conditions
you can imagine.</font>

346
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:23,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

347
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cousin slid out feet first
in a pickle barrel.</font>

348
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:27,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle was born
during rainy season</font>

349
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:29,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a Mongolian sheep pasture.</font>

350
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother, hmm, born under
a crowded noodle bar</font>

351
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">while my grandfather finished
his happy dancing shrimp.</font>

352
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing can stop us.</font>

353
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the hurricanes.
Not the communists.</font>

354
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:40,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the feds.
Not the girl scouts.</font>

355
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Get in there.</font>

356
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? Forget it.
I'm the worst.</font>

357
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:47,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a discussion
for a different time.</font>

358
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:50,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Britta,
there is something in you</font>

359
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">that wants to take care
of people so bad</font>

360
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you'll do it
until you puke.</font>

361
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:55,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Shirley needs
right now.</font>

362
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying I'll be
a good mom?</font>

363
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

364
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, you will really force
anything, won't you?</font>

365
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:05,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get in there and force
that baby out of Shirley.</font>

366
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside, people!
Britta for the win!</font>

367
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my way.
Okay. I am ready.</font>

368
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:16,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, walk me through this.</font>

369
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, at each contraction,</font>

370
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to tell Shirley
to push.</font>

371
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?</font>

372
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:21,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't tell any doctors
I said this,</font>

373
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:22,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">but at this point in time,</font>

374
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:23,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bus pretty much drives itself.</font>

375
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:24,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who exactly is the bus
in this scenario? Oh!</font>

376
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:27,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oooooh!
- Push!</font>

377
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:32,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Push, push, push.
- Push, push, push.</font>

378
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:34,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley. Push.</font>

379
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">The head is out!</font>

380
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now feel under the neck
for the umbilical cord.</font>

381
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no chord.</font>

382
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's a good thing,
Britta.</font>

383
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I am nailing this!
You're doing great too.</font>

384
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, more stories.</font>

385
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so in World War II,</font>

386
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lot of us were rounded up
in labor camps.</font>

387
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mining mostly.</font>

388
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hundreds of Changs were born
underneath the earth.</font>

389
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most spent their first five
years underground.</font>

390
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, I'm here.
- Oh, Andre!</font>

391
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Hi, baby.</font>

392
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's gonna be all right.
- Okay.</font>

393
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, ma'am.
We can take it from here.</font>

394
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:08,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I got it.
I'm in the zone.</font>

395
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on, Shirley.
Come on, Shirley.</font>

396
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Shirley.
Push push push.</font>

397
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Push it!
- Push!</font>

398
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it comes!
It's baby Greendale!</font>

399
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys don't have
to name it that.</font>

400
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:19,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't claim that power.
I'm merely the deliverer.</font>

401
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:22,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Britta, focus.
- Oh, doy. Okay.</font>

402
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:26,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Push, push, push...</font>

403
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's a boy!</font>

404
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's also a black person!</font>

405
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that that's important.</font>

406
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure it's yours, baby?
- Yes.</font>

407
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's definitely his.</font>

408
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never told you this part,</font>

409
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:42,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">but all Changs are born
with tails.</font>

410
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kind of dodged
a bullet there.</font>

411
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agh! Ugh!</font>

412
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:51,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did that just happen?</font>

413
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's back.
- It never left.</font>

414
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Oh.</font>

415
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:08,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, we did it, sugar boots.
- No, you did it, baby.</font>

416
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, sir.</font>

417
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a fierce campaign,
I happily concede</font>

418
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">this baby to you.</font>

419
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pretty classy of me.
- Thank you, Chang.</font>

420
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't have done this
without you.</font>

421
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No bigs.
- Andre.</font>

422
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

423
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I want to name him
after Ben.</font>

424
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Hmm?</font>

425
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Really?</font>

426
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I mean, you may not
be his father,</font>

427
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you helped bring him
into the world.</font>

428
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, we'll have
our own little baby Ben...</font>

429
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bennett.
- Ben Bennett?</font>

430
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, damn.</font>

431
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. No, no. No, that's fine.</font>

432
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben Bennett.
Hi, Ben Bennett.</font>

433
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, he said Chang.</font>

434
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No, he didn't.</font>

435
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See? Nothing to it.
- Yeah.</font>

436
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe
that's how we come</font>

437
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">into this world?</font>

438
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screaming, crying,
covered in crap?</font>

439
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then somewhere
along the lines,</font>

440
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">we get it into our heads
that we're destined</font>

441
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">for greatness.</font>

442
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:06,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are. I just yanked
a little dude</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">In a good way?</font>

453
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:32,214

00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know people do it in movies
all the time,</font>

460
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there are bound to be
