<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot,
red-haired guy.</font>

3
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:10,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

4
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:11,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's not right
about the game.</font>

5
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:13,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just took out a guy
who turned out to be</font>

6
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:14,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">a professional
paintball assassin.</font>

7
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:17,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">A professional?
Aah!</font>

8
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:18,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make sense.</font>

9
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would someone
who gets paid to do things</font>

10
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:22,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">be at Greendale?</font>

11
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:28,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no! I'm not playing!
I'm not playing!</font>

12
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm the dean!
Stop shooting me!</font>

13
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Pistol Patty.</font>

14
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they take you hostage?</font>

15
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:46,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean Spreck?</font>

16
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:48,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Craig.</font>

17

<font color="#FFFFFF">City College.</font>

18
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:51,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I understand everything.</font>

19
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:56,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now your whole evil plan
is clear as day.</font>

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you need to explain it
to your men, I understand.</font>

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's simple, Craig.</font>

22
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:03,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I posed as a fake
ice cream company,</font>

23
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">sponsored your
end-of-the-year picnic,</font>

24
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:08,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">and waved enough money
under your students' noses</font>

25
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:12,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">to provoke them
to destroy their own campus.</font>

26

<font color="#FFFFFF">Who hurt you, Steven?</font>

27
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:16,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could any dean be so mean?</font>

28
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:19,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you haven't seen</font>

29
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">how mean this dean
can be... en.</font>

30
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:24,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one!</font>

31
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">After him!</font>

32
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:32,902

00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">City College is trying
to destroy Greendale,</font>

00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:55,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're an unstoppable juggle knob.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Juggernaut.
- Juggernaut.</font>

38
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:58,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means if
we're gonna fight them,</font>

39
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have to form a school-wide
alliance of rebels.</font>

40

<font color="#FFFFFF">In other words, it seems
we've left the Western motif</font>

41

<font color="#FFFFFF">and are entering a more
of a <i>Star Wars</i> scenario.</font>

42
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:10,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">to form a faceless regime,</font>

43
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,527

00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:23,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">And second,
Magnitude's a one-man party.</font>

49
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,255

can't be in an alliance.</font>

50

- Easy, paradox.</font>

52

<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all on the same side.</font>

53
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:32,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But hasn't the other side
already won?</font>

54
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:33,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their goal was to make us
trash the school.</font>

55
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">We trashed it.</font>

56
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but we still
might have a chance</font>

57
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hit 'em where it hurts.</font>

58
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:38,326

- Oh.</font>

61
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think
they sent in a ringer to win?</font>

62
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be because we're entitled</font>

63
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the prize they promised.</font>

64
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">100 Gs.</font>

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I could use that money.</font>

66
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why
we have to agree right now</font>

67
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:56,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">that whoever wins,
we give the money to Greendale.</font>

68

<font color="#FFFFFF">To repair the damage
and save our school.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever, pal. I ain't in it
for your revolution.</font>

71
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,494

72
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,195

73
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:07,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but I'm calling dibs
on the Han Solo role</font>

slouches into it by default.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-Burns,
I need that vest.</font>

76
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, right.</font>

77
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:13,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the vest, Laser Breath.</font>

78
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:18,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before our conversation gets nasty.</font>

79

How long is the game gonna last?</font>

a single soldier.</font>

to being leader, Troy.</font>

87

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff.</font>

89
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,801

What is that?</font>

Pop what?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What is he trying to say?
Pop what, Magnitude?</font>

95
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:09,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you hear me?
Who is this?</font>

96
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's Jeff Winger.</font>

97
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in trouble now.</font>

98
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, it's your friend the dean.
I'm safe!</font>

99
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hear you,
Mr. Winger.</font>

100
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is City College's
dean Spreck.</font>

101
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Spreck, you cheat.</font>

102
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't spray people
with paint by remote.</font>

103
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can't have
City College students</font>

104
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a Greendale game.</font>

105

107
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for rules,
they're clearly defined</font>

108
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your school's agreement</font>

you're out.</font>

111
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm glad to see
there's paperwork involved,</font>

112

118

<font color="#FFFFFF">We were gonna shoot him,</font>

119
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">but tell him what you told us.</font>

120
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:05,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot me.</font>

121
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.
Now shoot him.</font>

122
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:08,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, shoot me.</font>

123
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:13,704

Jeff Winger a big favor.</font>

00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:18,309

and defeat City College.</font>

127

<font color="#FFFFFF">I also have no choice</font>

128
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to accept the role
thrust upon me.</font>

129
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what role would that be?</font>

130
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">No time to squabble, Troy.</font>

131

<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, you keep watch
while we get these.</font>

154
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.
Help me with this.</font>

155
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure thing, your worship.</font>

156
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed!</font>

157
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop trying to be Han Solo.</font>

158
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's making me
embarrassed for you.</font>

159
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Admit it. You like it.</font>

160
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like having conversations
with adults.</font>

161
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:44,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing <i>Star Wars</i>
is worn out and immature.</font>

162
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like me because I'm immature.</font>

163
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not enough
immaturity in your life.</font>

164
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I don't
get shot waiting out here.</font>

165
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:57,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd hate to go home to my babies.</font>

166
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">So reconnaissance indicates</font>

167
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:01,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">the key to City College's
strategy is</font>

168
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gatling gun inside
the ice cream truck,</font>

169
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:05,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">which we will charge on masse,</font>

170
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">overwhelming their defenses,</font>

171
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">and taking that gun
for ourselves.</font>

172
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:10,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not how
I would proceed.</font>

173
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, do you happen
to have a better plan?</font>

174
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do happen, Jeff.
I happen very much.</font>

175
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll use sneak attacks</font>

176
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">to draw their patrol
to the library,</font>

177
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">where one of us
will pull the fire alarm,</font>

178
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">activating the sprinklers,</font>

179
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I will have rigged
using my super plumbing skills</font>

180
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">to shower everything
in the building with paint.</font>

181
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paint in sprinklers?</font>

182
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are we the little rascals?
- I was.</font>

183
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:32,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you heard your plan?</font>

184
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to charge a machine gun.</font>

185
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:42,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got something to say.</font>

186
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't take orders from girls.</font>

187
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they don't talk to me.</font>

188
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:48,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it, Quasar face.</font>

189
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's a good kid
and a better shot.</font>

190
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:53,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">So listen up,
or you'll be floating home.</font>

191
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Abed.
Sorry.</font>

192
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:58,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Han.</font>

193
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think we should
split the troops in half</font>

194
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">and carry out both plans
simultaneously.</font>

195
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:06,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, your plan will lure people
off the ice cream truck,</font>

196
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:09,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">allowing Jeff's troops
to take the stronghold.</font>

197
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

198
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad
that we didn't shoot you.</font>

199
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we have
the tactical advantage</font>

200
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">of knowing that Jeff Winger
wants to be a ballerina,</font>

201
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that his Achilles heel
is... wieners.</font>

202
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just
the tip of the iceberg.</font>

203
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:24,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">For one more pudding,</font>

204
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you why
he's jealous of me.</font>

205
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you say that they kicked
you out of their study group</font>

206
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:30,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">- after two years?
- Yeah.</font>

207
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">What took them so long?</font>

208
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, thanks for sticking up
for me back there.</font>

209
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">This group gets so tangled
in each other's feelings,</font>

210
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're kind of a hero
for standing outside of it.</font>

211
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, heroes are great,</font>

212
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll take a blaster
every time.</font>

213
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway,
just wanted to let you know.</font>

214
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you're immature.</font>

215
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're great.</font>

216
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a no-good,</font>

217
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">laser-faced,
jabba scoundrel.</font>

218
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're good, kid.</font>

219
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:06,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get cocky.</font>

220
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:12,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

221
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:22,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're right on our tail.</font>

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Operation "Troy's Awesome Plan"</font>

223
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:25,237

224
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:27,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, good for you.</font>

225
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:29,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like they're
taking Troy's bait.</font>

226
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:32,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squad "B" commencing
operation "Actual Operation."</font>

227
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone look alive.
Leonard, good enough.</font>

228
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale, it's been a pleasure
fighting with you.</font>

229
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us won't make it.</font>

230
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:43,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is a place where we
will all see each other again,</font>

231
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and that place is Denny's.
- Which Denny's?</font>

232
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll figure it out
later, Leonard.</font>

233
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:48,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one near the 15 exit?
I'm banned from there.</font>

234
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then I guess
I'll see you in hell.</font>

235
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let's kick some taint.</font>

236
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. On my count.</font>

237
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

238
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,096

00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:12,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright.</font>

241
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go go go!</font>

242
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock the door.</font>

243
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Shirley, you have
the most important job, okay?</font>

244
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, pull the fire alarm.</font>

245
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we move this along?
I'm missing</font>

246
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enemy soldiers are incoming.</font>

247
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:28,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need everyone to evacuate
through the air vent.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Garrett!</font>

249
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be stuck in this vent.</font>

250
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is too early to tell.</font>

251
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:52,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think our only choice
is to try and shoot our way out.</font>

252
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:56,778

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

305
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's it.
- Is that it?</font>

306
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:32,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think that's it.
- That's it?</font>

307
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We win!
- We win!</font>

308
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:35,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we win!</font>

309
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

310
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:46,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">We win! We win! Yes!</font>

311
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right! We did it!</font>

312
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:55,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

313
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother's lover.</font>

314
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What?</font>

315
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I win!</font>

316
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You owe me 100 Gs.</font>

317
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can make the check out...</font>

318
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Greendale.</font>

319
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human beings!
Human beings!</font>

320
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human beings! Human beings!</font>

321
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:27,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human beings!
Human beings!</font>

322
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:41,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- There it is.</font>

323
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Final meeting of the semester
now in session.</font>

324
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Final order of business...</font>

325
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick a class we can all
take in the fall.</font>

326
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could just take Anthro 201.</font>

327
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too risky. Sequels are almost
always disappointing.</font>

328
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:55,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when are you in favor
of playing it safe, Han?</font>

329
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:56,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool down, Annie.</font>

330
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:59,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only Han Solo
because the context demanded it.</font>

331
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here...</font>

332
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Star-Burns.</font>

333
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:07,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he uses some kind
of crystal instead of deodorant.</font>

334
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I know exactly
what we should do.</font>

335
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:13,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should see what Troy
thinks we should do.</font>

336
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:14,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had some good ideas today.</font>

337
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, man.</font>

338
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I've given this
a lot of thought,</font>

339
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:25,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've decided
we should sleep on it.</font>

340
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:28,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just came back
for my day planner.</font>

341
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretend I'm not even here.</font>

342
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are great at that.</font>

343
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:34,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Pierce. We all know
this is no "day planner".</font>

344
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is.</font>

345
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you'll excuse me,</font>

346
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">it appears I'm running late
to drink a bottle of wine</font>

347
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my bathing suit.</font>

348
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, wait.</font>

349
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:50,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've been coming
to this school for 12 years.</font>

350
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been friends
with anyone here</font>

351
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:55,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than a semester.</font>

352
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:58,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably for the same reason
I've been married seven times.</font>

353
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:02,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I assume eventually
I'll be rejected,</font>

354
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I, you know,
test people, push them,</font>

355
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">until they prove me right.</font>

356
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a sickness.
I admit it.</font>

357
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this place
has always accepted me,</font>

358
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">sickness and all.</font>

359
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place accepted all of you.</font>

360
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sickness and all.</font>

361
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:21,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worth thinking about.</font>

362
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I think we have
thought about it, Pierce,</font>

363
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're right.</font>

364
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we were just picking a class</font>

365
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:31,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">we could all be in this fall.</font>

366
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'd love for you to join us.</font>

367
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thanks.</font>

368
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:39,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done with you guys.</font>

369
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like this school,</font>

370
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm done
with whatever you call this.</font>

371
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adios.</font>

372
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was my ride.
- I'm going after him.</font>

373
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's just acting out.</font>

374
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen this behavior before.</font>

375
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:54,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">In cats.</font>

376
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:57,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My... my cats.
- It's true.</font>

377
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:01,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now he'll come
slinking back in five,</font>

378
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:06,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">four, three, two...</font>

379
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:39,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then
one of the storm troopers</font>

380
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">shot the others,
and it was Pierce.</font>

381
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:44,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we won.
We saved Greendale.</font>

382
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sounds like you guys had a lot of fun.
- Yep.</font>

383
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, I don't know how
we're gonna top it next year.</font>

384
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I got a pitch.
Why use guns?</font>

385
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a hose and spray
the whole school with paint.</font>

386
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Every inch of it.
- Actually, we kind of did that.</font>

387
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you been to the library?</font>

388
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm working my way there.
- Mm.</font>

389
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:02,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can just
put that anywhere.</font>

390
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doing anything fun
for the summer?</font>

391
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No plans.
- Cool.</font>

392
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, cool, cool.</font>

393
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slippery.</font>
