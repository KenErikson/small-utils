00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:04,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi!
- Hey guys</font>

3
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:12,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did everyone have a good break?</font>

4
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:14,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I discovered
a new back muscle</font>

5
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">to work out.</font>

6
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:18,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies, you'll thank me
come tank top season.</font>

7
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked all of
Pierce's wardrobes</font>

8
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">for portals to magical worlds.</font>

9
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:23,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I found was something
called Emmanuelle in Space</font>

10
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">on laserdisc...
I couldn't watch it,</font>

11
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:26,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it sounded sexy.</font>

12
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:28,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Laserdisc.</font>

13
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I joined a campus volunteer
group that cleans the city.</font>

14
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We picked up litter on the freeway</font>

15
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">and dredged the river.</font>

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dredged it for what?</font>

17
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, garbage and stuff.</font>

18
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tires, condoms, needles.</font>

19
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">At one point, we found a finger.</font>

20
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:43,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you using your
I-love-butterflies voice?</font>

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Am I?</font>

22
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:45,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

23
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Volunteer work is nice.</font>

24
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:47,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do nice things.</font>

25
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:48,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">With nice people.</font>

26
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:50,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

27
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:54,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's finding river
fingers with a cute boy.</font>

28
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:55,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

29
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay, yes,
but it doesn't matter.</font>

30
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like I'm seeing anyone.
There's just a guy.</font>

31
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:02,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A guy that goes to Greendale?
- Mm.</font>

32
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the Russian guy that
looks like a short Johnny Depp?</font>

33
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It doesn't matter.
- Is it the guy who looks</font>

34
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little like Vince Vaughn
but smells a lot like fish?</font>

35
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to talk about it.</font>

36
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have someone in my life</font>

37
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:11,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I'm happy to talk about.</font>

38
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again with the Jesus.</font>

39
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:14,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Jesus is
always in my life,</font>

40
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">but things have been
looking better every day</font>

41
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my ex-husband.</font>

42
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the guy that looks
like Anderson Cooper</font>

43
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:22,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">but with a soul patch
and the ponytail?</font>

44
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Is it black Michael Chiklis?</font>

45
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- The white George Foreman?</font>

46
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are talking
about the same person.</font>

47
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:29,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's biracial, his name is David,</font>

48
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:30,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's a human being.</font>

49
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, stop guessing.</font>

50
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a thing at all.
It's just a friend.</font>

51
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:36,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Change the subject.
- Chang the subject.</font>

52
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing up there?</font>

53
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the beginning of a new
semester of Anthropology.</font>

54
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:44,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm here to get
what I was promised.</font>

55
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:46,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. Who has Chang's
pile of nothing?</font>

56
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what I mean.
- I am sick of the runaround.</font>

57
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to demand
an immediate answer</font>

58
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">about whether I'm
joining the study group.</font>

59
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:55,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if we have to
give an immediate answer,</font>

60
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">it would have to be no.</font>

61
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your time.</font>

62
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sleep on it.</font>

63
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then get back to me.</font>

64
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or else.</font>

65
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you did say we would
let him in eventually.</font>

66
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:10,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was before he started
using his name as a pun.</font>

67
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes me so changry.</font>

68
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, it's happening to me.</font>

69
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get back to who
Annie's in love with.</font>

70
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it Fat Neil?
- Blue Streak?</font>

71
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Optimus Prime?</font>

72
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, even I know some
of these are Transformers.</font>

73
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares who it is?
Let's just study.</font>

74
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:22,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study what? We haven't
had our first class yet.</font>

75
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:23,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, could we
talk about something</font>

76
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:24,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">other than Annie's love life?</font>

77
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:26,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could talk
about my love life.</font>

78
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it Jean-Claude van Overbite?</font>

79
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should really start
learning people's names.</font>

80
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree with brown
Jamie Lee Curtis.</font>

to date your ex-husband</font>

86
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:09,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">- after what he did to you?
- He apologized.</font>

87
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he apologized.</font>

88
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess that completely
unbangs that stripper.</font>

89
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:15,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, forgive me
for being forgiving.</font>

90
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:17,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's right.
You don't know how.</font>

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm relieved Shirley
is seeing her ex-husband</font>

92
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not Chang.</font>

93
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:22,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang? Why would
she be with Chang?</font>

94
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I have to say
everything I'm thinking?</font>

95
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:27,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish my mouth was further
away from my brain.</font>

96
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:29,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish my brain had its own brain.</font>

97
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:31,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish Chang hadn't
had sex with Shirley.</font>

00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:36,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

101
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:38,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't talk about it.</font>

102
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I'm your roommate.</font>

103
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:40,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can keep a secret.</font>

104
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, remember
that Halloween party</font>

105
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:44,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">that none of us can remember?</font>

106
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:46,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember
anything we can remember.</font>

107
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:47,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Chang left me
a message that night</font>

110

<font color="#FFFFFF">You have my word
as your roommate,</font>

111
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that is a bond I
will never violate.</font>

112
00:03:58,549 --> 00:03:59,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tweet it either.</font>

113
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never discussed new media.</font>

114
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry all that
stuff got dragged out</font>

115
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">about me having a
crush on somebody.</font>

116
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you be
sorry about that?</font>

117
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:09,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know. Awkward.</font>

118
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, you don't think
I actually care, did you?</font>

119
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:14,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I just didn't want you
to think I thought you cared.</font>

120
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greetings, all and sundry,</font>

121
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">and welcome to your second
semester of Anthropology,</font>

122
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">where it is about to get real.</font>

123
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I forget where we
left off last year.</font>

124
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fat Neil.
- The bronze age.</font>

125
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Fat Neil.</font>

126
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:27,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neil's fine.</font>

127
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not from an
actuarial standpoint.</font>

128
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now please forgive my lateness,</font>

129
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I wasn't sure how
to find Greendale sober.</font>

130
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you heard me right.</font>

131
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:39,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have stopped drinking.</font>

132
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:43,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mainly due to the fact that I
could no longer get an erection.</font>

133
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that I'm on the wagon,</font>

134
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:46,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can expect both this class</font>

135
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:50,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my penis to be more
focused and rewarding.</font>

136
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, there's gonna be
more than one diorama.</font>

137
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:54,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lame!</font>

138
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Boo.
- I am so sorry.</font>

139
00:04:57,574 --> 00:05:00,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I train seeing-eye dogs,
and today was graduation.</font>

140
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:02,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't leave without
shaking all their little paws.</font>

141
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aww.
- Rich.</font>

142
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff.
- Rich!</font>

143
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie.
- Annie? Rich?</font>

144
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're taking Anthropology?</font>

145
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you made it sound so fun.</font>

146
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">We spent the holiday break</font>

147
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">dredging a river together.
We found...</font>

148
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:16,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">A finger. Yeah.</font>

149
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds gruesome, I know,</font>

150
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:19,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm used to seeing
that kind of thing,</font>

151
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- because I'm a doctor.
- All: Ohh.</font>

152
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe Rich actually
enrolled in our class.</font>

153
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:28,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means he likes me, right?</font>

154
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't he,
Annie? He is so sweet.</font>

155
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sweet and wise.</font>

156
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has lived such a long,
full life.</font>

157
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old is he again?</font>

158
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">30-something, I'm assuming.</font>

159
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a landline and
uses the word "album."</font>

160
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys don't think he's
too old for me, do you?</font>

161
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No. Come on.</font>

162
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">By that logic, I wouldn't have a
shot with anybody at this table.</font>

163
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

164
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, speaking of creepy,</font>

165
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">sober Duncan is worse
than drunk Duncan.</font>

166
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this class is
about to get really hard.</font>

167
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea about that.</font>

168
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich is really smart,</font>

169
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he knows a lot
about anthropology.</font>

170
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we were to start
studying with him,</font>

171
00:05:58,869 --> 00:05:59,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it could help a lot.</font>

172
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:01,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, you know...</font>

173
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you know what, though?</font>

174
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:08,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just realized,
so unfair to so many people.</font>

175
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right? Britta,
you're always talking</font>

176
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:10,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how it's weird</font>

177
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have no one of Latin descent</font>

178
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:13,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- in our group.
- Si.</font>

179
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:14,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Pierce,
you're always looking</font>

180
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:15,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">for someone old enough</font>

181
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find your racism subversive.</font>

182
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could go on and on.</font>

183
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a process.</font>

184
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:22,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes time.</font>

185
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then I say we
gather all the candidates</font>

186
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:27,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make an informed,
democratic decision.</font>

187
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can have a little mixer</font>

188
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">and invite the people we're
submitting for consideration.</font>

189
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All in favor of tonight?
- Oh, I am.</font>

190
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:34,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. I'm finished.</font>

191
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:37,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'd say you got
about two more good years.</font>

192
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, everyone,</font>

193
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is Andre,
my ex-husband and boyfriend.</font>

194
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came to spend the day with me.</font>

195
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:45,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, nice to meet you guys.</font>

196
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:48,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've heard a lot
about every last one of you.</font>

197
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't heard a lot
about you or what you've done</font>

198
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">or with who.</font>

199
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hope you give
me a chance to make up</font>

200
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">for everything you
haven't heard about me.</font>

201
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how about a round
of soft serve on me?</font>

202
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, I've been
fed a lot of soft serve</font>

203
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a lot of guys.</font>

204
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it's rent money,</font>

205
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes it's Chili
Peppers tickets,</font>

206
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:09,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, yeah, I'll admit it,</font>

207
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">one time it was a gym
bag full of nickels,</font>

208
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it never lasts,
and they never change.</font>

209
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, I'm a grown-ass woman,
and I made my decision.</font>

210
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how do you know
it's the right one?</font>

211
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm pregnant, okay?</font>

212
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:27,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to wait to
share my exciting news,</font>

213
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:29,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you</font>

214
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I am eight weeks along.</font>

215
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is a little surprising.</font>

216
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halloween.</font>

217
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Both: Nothing.</font>

218
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:43,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming,
fellow Anthropology students.</font>

219
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first semester,</font>

220
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:47,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">you knew us as "that study group."</font>

221
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, tonight,
we want to get to know you.</font>

222
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please forgive the spread.</font>

223
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:51,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vending machines
haven't been restocked</font>

224
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:52,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">since before winter break.</font>

225
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:55,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">So help yourselves
to tropical skittles,</font>

226
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:56,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">cigarettes, or mouthwash.</font>

227
00:07:56,872 --> 00:07:59,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">And have a good time.</font>

228
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so I have to figure
out if Shirley did it</font>

229
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">with her ex-husband the
week after Halloween.</font>

230
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you gonna do that?</font>

231
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got moves.</font>

232
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... Bun in the oven.</font>

233
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:16,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess it's no surprise after
working on it all this time.</font>

234
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't quite
say working on it.</font>

235
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kind of happens, you know.</font>

236
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, I do.</font>

237
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially when the
season's right.</font>

238
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead leaves, pumpkins everywhere...</font>

239
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nature's Viagra. Right?</font>

240
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:29,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess.</font>

241
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then when all the pumpkins</font>

242
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:32,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">just start to rot</font>

243
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all the children have
removed their outfits</font>

244
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:38,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they've already
gotten their candy...</font>

245
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go talk to some
other people, all right?</font>

246
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So?
- His mind is like a fortress.</font>

247
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we just tell Shirley,</font>

248
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, look, you slept with Chang"?</font>

249
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:56,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her deal with it.</font>

250
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:57,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, if someone
had sex with Chang</font>

251
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they get to not
remember that happened,</font>

252
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's a gift from God.</font>

253
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not taking that away from
her without a good reason.</font>

254
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:04,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's a good reason.</font>

255
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever go to the bathroom</font>

256
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:06,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">and find parsley in your teeth</font>

257
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your friends
hadn't told you about?</font>

258
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now imagine your
teeth are a uterus</font>

259
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that parsley is
a half-Chinese baby.</font>

260
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

261
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to meet someone.</font>

262
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Quendra,</font>

263
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:19,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I spell it with a Q-U.</font>

264
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's thinking about
taking Anthropology.</font>

265
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:24,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">So maybe she would make
a nice addition or two</font>

266
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:26,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">to our study group.
Something to consider.</font>

267
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Abed?</font>

268
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love Star Wars.</font>

269
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:32,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's Troy.
- I love footballs.</font>

270
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, we're dealing with
heavier things right now</font>

271
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:36,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">than your shameless lobbying.</font>

272
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich brought kettle corn!</font>

273
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kettle corn!
That's a fun-time snack.</font>

274
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:42,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, looks great.
- I make it in my garage.</font>

275
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take some of that.</font>

276
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:47,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spell kettle corn with a Q-U.</font>

277
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't.</font>

278
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this? What's going on?</font>

279
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:51,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mixer.</font>

280
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is everyone from
Anthro class here?</font>

281
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys picking a
new study group member?</font>

282
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you didn't invite me?</font>

283
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't know how to reach you.</font>

284
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?
I'm everywhere.</font>

285
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:03,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't know how to reach you.</font>

286
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a true. That's a lie.</font>

287
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mixer. We didn't
know how to reach you.</font>

288
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mixer. It's a mixer.
It's a mixer.</font>

289
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mixer. It's a mixer.</font>

290
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Works every time.</font>

291
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">$50? What a pig.</font>

292
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, I think we
should vote now.</font>

293
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most people left after
we ran out of skittles,</font>

294
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, come on, it's pretty obvious</font>

295
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:33,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich is the best candidate.</font>

296
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Looks like he's our guy.</font>

297
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:36,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right there.</font>

298
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be happening.</font>

299
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree.</font>

300
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't talk and

441
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,188

00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is what she wants.</font>

454
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are.</font>

455
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mezzanine?</font>

456
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:22,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice sweater.
- Thanks.</font>

457
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad gave it to me.</font>

458
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:28,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, um...
- Look, I'm not mad at Shirley.</font>

459
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:29,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not?</font>

460
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm mad at myself.</font>

461
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, if I hadn't
left her like I did,</font>

462
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">then none of this
would have happened.</font>

463
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:40,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever have something that
you didn't truly appreciate</font>

464
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you didn't have it anymore?</font>

465
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Keristina.</font>

466
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:46,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old girlfriend?</font>

467
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almond facial scrub.</font>

468
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">They only make it in Finland.</font>

469
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old me would have
been long gone by now.</font>

470
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think I
could ever change,</font>

471
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:57,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm gonna tell you,
the love of a good woman</font>

472
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:58,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes anything possible.</font>

473
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it looks like I'm
gonna be a daddy again.</font>

474
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:05,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but...
- Hey.</font>

475
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter who
the baby's father is.</font>

476
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in it for the long haul.</font>

477
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it's mine,</font>

478
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:13,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's gonna be a great
football player.</font>

479
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it's Chang's,</font>

480
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll go for golf.</font>

481
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

482
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie just texted me.</font>

483
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asked Rich out.</font>

484
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:35,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

485
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said no.</font>

486
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:39,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said she's great but too young.</font>

487
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say anything until
I've said what I've got to say.</font>

488
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known you for
almost two years now,</font>

489
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:22,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've never taken you as
seriously as I should have.</font>

490
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the strangest,
coolest, most genuine person</font>

491
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:31,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've ever met,
and the thing that scares me</font>

492
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">about you is how good
you make me wish I was.</font>

493
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me, Rich.</font>

494
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me become like you.</font>

495
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I am so amazing.</font>

496
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not perfect.</font>

497
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

498
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that power.</font>

499
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can abuse it.</font>

500
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you are one funny bunny.</font>

501
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just fake being good</font>

502
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to get away
with doing bad things.</font>

503
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I completely understand.</font>

504
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you understand
that I still have to try?</font>

505
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you don't help me,</font>

506
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:16,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're a bad person.</font>

507
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got me there, guy.</font>

508
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:21,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in and dry off.</font>

509
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:25,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it smells delicious.
Are you baking?</font>

510
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, muffin tops.</font>

511
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're back.
Today, we'll show you</font>

512
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to make homemade
kettle corn with Dr. Rich.</font>

513
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:34,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich, how do I get</font>

514
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of those giant spoons?</font>

515
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:38,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, actually,
I carved this one myself</font>

516
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">after lightning struck an
oak tree in my backyard.</font>

517
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh.
- And then I made my nephew</font>

518
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">a rocking horse.</font>

519
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:45,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's adorable.
- It smells heavenly.</font>

520
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Rich, what sets
your kettle corn apart?</font>

521
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's a secret ingredient...</font>

522
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">a couple extra pinches of love.</font>

523
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can't beat that.</font>

524
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It feels good.
- Not this again.</font>

525
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:56,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich, you know they're
doing a fake morning show?</font>

526
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:58,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no cameras.</font>

527
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

528
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a fun way
to start the day.</font>

529
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">So grab a paddle, partner,</font>

530
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hop on in here.</font>

531
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what,
that does sound...</font>

532
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

533
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy and Abed in the morning.</font>
