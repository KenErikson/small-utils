you're free to go,</font>

152
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:45,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you didn't step forward
and are therefore innocent.</font>

153
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:48,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't ignore the facts.</font>

154
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two are ruining this group.</font>

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, just because
we're good-looking</font>

156
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- doesn't make us villains.
- Yeah, are you sure you guys</font>

157
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:56,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">have the group's
best interests at heart?</font>

158
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feast your ear tongues
on these memory pops.</font>

159
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you've had three flu shots.</font>

160
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's for the day care center.</font>

161
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be a living God!</font>

162
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:09,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're considering
the exciting opportunity</font>

163

open your starter kits.</font>

165
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:19,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now that the seals
have been broken,</font>

166
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,650

make me look fat?</font>

169
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:42,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Jeff Winger.</font>

170
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love working this BlackBerry,</font>

171
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,977

tones my thumbs.</font>

172
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:58,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a particularly small egg.</font>

173

all you want.</font>

175
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:06,986

that popping the back of a raft,</font>

three weeks!</font>

on me like that.</font>

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are just stories
about us being cute.</font>

184
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys actually
go out of your way</font>

185
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">to endanger the fabric
of this group.</font>

186
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, leave our fabric alone.</font>

187
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys aren't seeing
the bigger picture.</font>

188
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:51,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">We compartmentalized our libidos
for the good of the group.</font>

189
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you compartmentalized,
did you?</font>

190
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what's been going on
with us all year?</font>

191
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

192
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:04,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking
about the Annie of it all...</font>

00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:08,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">The long looks,
the stolen glances,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.
We're done.</font>

299
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We're done.</font>

300
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you all tomorrow.</font>

301
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you guys, wait.
I want to say something.</font>

302
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to save us
with a speech.</font>

303
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not breaking up,</font>

304
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:28,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we don't need to get
back together.</font>

305
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I don't have to,
but I want to.</font>

306
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:35,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we've known each other
for almost two years now.</font>

307
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, yeah, in that time,</font>

308
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've given a lot of speeches,</font>

309
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they all have
one thing in common.</font>

310
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all different.</font>

311
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">These drug runners
aren't gonna execute Pierce</font>

312
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he's racist.</font>

313
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:50,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a locomotive
that runs on us.</font>

314
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only sharks
in that water,</font>

315
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:56,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the emotional ghosts
that I like to call fear.</font>

316
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anchovies. Fear.</font>

317
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the dangers
of ingesting mercury.</font>

318
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the real bugs
aren't the ones in those beds.</font>

319
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's no such thing
as a free Caesar salad.</font>

320
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:10,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if there were...</font>

321
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:12,026
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Cape</i> still might find</font>

322
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">a second life on cable.</font>

323
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll tell you why.</font>

324
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,185
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>El corazon del agua es verdad.</i></font>

325
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">That water is a lie!</font>

326
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harrison Ford
is irradiating our testicles</font>

327
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">with microwave
satellite transmissions!</font>

328
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:26,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">So maybe we are caught
in an endless cycle</font>

329
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">of screwups and hurt feelings,</font>

330
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I choose to believe
it's just the universe's way</font>

331
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">of molding us
into some kind of supergroup.</font>

332
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the Traveling Wilburys.</font>

333
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:40,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Troy, like
the Traveling Wilburys of pain...</font>

334
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepared for any insane
adventure life throws our way.</font>

335
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't know about you,</font>

336
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:47,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm looking forward
to every one of them.</font>

337
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeffrey.</font>

338
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:50,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jeff.</font>

339
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, Jeffrey.</font>

340
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess
we can get through anything.</font>

341
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's probably okay</font>

342
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:02,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you and Britta want to keep,
you know, hooking up.</font>

343
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't mind it so much.
- I'm cool with it.</font>

344
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- God cares.
- Whatever.</font>

345
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:09,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun tonight.</font>

346
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

347
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we don't have to keep
sneaking around anymore.</font>

348
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess not.</font>

349
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to stop doing this?</font>

350
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

351
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not you, it's me.
- It's you.</font>

352
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:28,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

353
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Ooh.</font>

354
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you guys
remember the time when...</font>

355
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those guys don't care
who they hurt, do they?</font>

356
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:46,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I still don't even know
if I'm in the group?</font>

357
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:51,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey...</font>

358
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I have had
some pretty good times, huh?</font>

359
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:06,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a year.</font>

360
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey everybody.
Can I help you with anything?</font>

361
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care about you guys.</font>

362
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:25,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, dean.
You dress in stupid outfits.</font>

363
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have a right
to your opinion,</font>

364
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'll just leave.</font>

365
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have been nicer
to the dean just then, Jeff.</font>

366
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?
I don't care.</font>

367
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think there maybe
could be repercussions, yo.</font>

368
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:37,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what you think.</font>

369
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care
about repercussions.</font>

370
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't care
about the dean.</font>

371
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay</font>

372
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, at that same moment,</font>

373
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:50,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">a truck full of toxic waste
crashes and spills on the dean,</font>

374
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">transforming him
into Mega-dean!</font>

375
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about anything.</font>

376
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. I care now!
Now I care!</font>

377
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too late.</font>

378
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you guys an apology.</font>

379
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dean runs our school.</font>

380
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:25,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's entitled
to a modicum of respect.</font>

381
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're always
so mean to him. Why?</font>

382
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's embarrassing to admit,</font>

383
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">but sometimes I felt jealous
of his interesting outfits.</font>

384
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey,
if I didn't know better,</font>

385
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:37,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say you had a crush on him.</font>

386
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never tell!</font>
