00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:11,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does being a librarian
make her even hotter?</font>

2
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:12,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're keepers of knowledge.</font>

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">She holds the answers
to all of our questions,</font>

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:15,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, "will you marry me,"</font>

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and "why are there still libraries."</font>

6
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be a book. She can pick me up.</font>

7
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:20,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flip through my pages.</font>

8
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure nobody drew wieners in me.</font>

9
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, maybe if we're too loud,
she'll shush us.</font>

10
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:28,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Books!</font>

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretend like you're asleep.</font>

12
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:34,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff.</font>

13
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you do when
you and your best friend</font>

14
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">wanna ask the same girl
to the Valentine's dance,</font>

15
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">but neither of you have dibs</font>

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you both fell in love
with her at first sight?</font>

17
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't believe in dibs,
or love at first sight,</font>

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">or love, or best friends, or doing things.</font>

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's good you brought this to me.</font>

20
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to open
your heart one day, Jeff.</font>

21
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens if I don't?</font>

22
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss the heart opening deadline?</font>

23
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:52,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valentine's Crapentine's.</font>

24
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opening my heart is on my list.</font>

25
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:57,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

26
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- What was that?</font>

27
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gum.
- Why aren't you chewing?</font>

28
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm using my mouth
for this dumb conversation.</font>

29
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:09,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

30
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my friend page.
She's cool, but... Whatever.</font>

31
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's cute.
- Oh, Troy.</font>

32
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you go barking up that tree,</font>

33
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:19,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to tell you that
she might not be interested.</font>

34
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:21,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't she be...</font>

35
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Is she...</font>

36
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">A friend of Ellen?</font>

37
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Annie. But you can say the word.</font>

38
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Page is a... Lesbian.</font>

39
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:38,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, as someone who's been
calling me a lesbian</font>

40
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:39,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the last year and a half,</font>

41
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:41,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that you don't have
anything to say</font>

42
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I do have is a prepared statement.</font>

46
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">good luck...</font>

47
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bon appetit.</font>

48
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:37,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many, many paragraphs of that</font>

49
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">were oddly supportive.</font>

50
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait till you hear the one
I have for you.</font>

51
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I know that wasn't gum.</font>

52
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:49,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.
It was an awesome exit pill.</font>

53
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zip! Zop! Zooey!</font>

54
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:53,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye!</font>

55
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta do something about Pierce
and those pain killers.</font>

56
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's recovering</font>

57
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">dude can moonwalk!</font>

58
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:11,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm sure he's almost
through his prescription.</font>

59
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, he's a baby boom.</font>

60
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">They invented drugs.</font>

61
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they also invented TV.</font>

62
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen him control one of those?</font>

63
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intervention. Intervention, intervention.</font>

64
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Count me out.
- We can't count you out.</font>

65
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">He listens to you.</font>

66
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he also listens
to the Barenaked Ladies.</font>

67
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get their dumb asses to help you.</font>

68
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back it up!
- Okay, Jeff.</font>

69
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are clearly in a bad space today.</font>

70
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Pierce is our friend,</font>

71
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Barenaked Ladies
are triple platinum... Are you?</font>

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does everyone leap
to defend that band</font>

73
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">so aggressively?</font>

74
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:40,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how much stuff do we have
to go through this year</font>

75
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">before my friendship
stops being questioned?</font>

76
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:42,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe friendship</font>

77
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:45,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">is about going through
a lot of stuff, Jeff.</font>

78
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:48,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe BNL has
two Billboard awards to your zero.</font>

79
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. They're... they're BNL now.</font>

80
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">We use shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies.</font>

81
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how fundamental they are.</font>

82
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah!</font>

83
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:58,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what Pierce probably
needs more than anything?</font>

84
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some space. Maybe I do too.</font>

85
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
Maybe we all need some space</font>

86
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pull the knife out of the back</font>

87
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the most celebrated Canadian
alt rock band</font>

88
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the mid-nineties,
you selfish, jaded ass!</font>

89
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">This... is a fight!</font>

90
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">We... are fighting!</font>

91
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:16,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff. Hello!</font>

92
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you're fighting
with your study group.</font>

93
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Correct.
- Now, you won't know this,</font>

94
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">being American, but tonight
Liverpool are playing...</font>

95
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Manchester United.
- Manchester United.</font>

96
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a stylish American, professor.</font>

97
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been forcing myself
to be into soccer since 2004.</font>

98
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Then it's destiny.</font>

99
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:34,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">God gave you a British friend
and a massive TV for a reason.</font>

100
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's Valentine's Day,
and even though we're fighting,</font>

101
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did promise the study group
I'd go to the dance...</font>

102
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised the study group?
Whip, crack!</font>

103
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you at precisely 6:30,</font>

104
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">or as the English call it,
gravedigger's biscuits.</font>

105
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

106
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">That moonwalk back there
was streets ahead, buddy.</font>

107
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, thanks, buddy.</font>

108
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Pierce!
- Hey, it's you!</font>

109
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. The tiny man you see
when you take enough pills.</font>

110
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a good time, don't we, Pierce?</font>

111
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I ain't hurtin'.
- And you wanna keep this going,</font>

112
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">right, 'cause... I'm sure you've noticed</font>

113
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">the prescription is almost done.</font>

114
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Ha. I don't think the doctor...</font>

115
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctor, you know, I know he won't...</font>

116
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, if doctors are so smart,</font>

117
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">why are there millions of 'em?</font>

118
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look in your hand.</font>

119
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Valentine's, buddy.</font>

120
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be mine.</font>

121
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mariah, my name is Abed Nadir.</font>

122
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My associate Troy Barnes.
- Charmed, I'm sure.</font>

123
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you the guys that keep staring at me</font>

124
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:42,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">and intermittently yelling out, "books"?</font>

125
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">The very same.
We are both interested</font>

126
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">in taking you to the Valentine's dance,</font>

127
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we are also best friends
with each other.</font>

128
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is of utmost importance
we protect that friendship</font>

129
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the stresses of courting you,</font>

130
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we're trying to be as direct</font>

131
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:53,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">and aboveboard about this as possible.</font>

132
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you go to the dance with one of us,</font>

133
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if so, which one?</font>

134
00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:59,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get something straight first.</font>

135
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the cutest thing
that's ever happened to me.</font>

136
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... I don't know either one of you.</font>

137
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us a moment.</font>

138
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I need to eat those tacos.</font>

139
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">New proposal: Get to know us at the dance</font>

140
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:15,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">and decide there which
of us you'd like to see again.</font>

141
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Deal.</font>

142
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

143
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:20,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in the briefcase?</font>

144
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:22,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Tacos.</font>

145
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want one?</font>

146
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:25,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

147
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. We really wanted them.</font>

148
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We're gonna eat them.</font>

149
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">So like... Would you change
clothes in front of her?</font>

150
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:35,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I know your lack
of world experience</font>

151
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">creates curiosity, but questions like that</font>

152
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">can make you seem a little bit homophobic.</font>

153
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's homophobic to ask questions?</font>

154
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have to ask
if it's homophobic to ask questions,</font>

155
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">haven't you already answered
your own question?</font>

156
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I?</font>

157
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know. Not a homophobe.</font>

158
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. There's Page.</font>

159
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I ask her 500 questions
about being a lesbian?</font>

160
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I just treat her
like a normal person?</font>

161
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a question you can ask.</font>

162
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hi.</font>

163
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a lesbian.
- Oh!</font>

164
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not either.
- Oh.</font>

165
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's cool that you're friends
with one.</font>

166
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

167
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:20,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Page isn't a lesbian.</font>

168
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just likes hanging out with Britta,</font>

169
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">because it makes her feel cool
to have a lesbian friend.</font>

170
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... Britta's not a lesbian.
She thinks that Page is.</font>

171
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:34,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what, Annie.</font>

172
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Page and I are going
to the dance together.</font>

173
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope I stay straight, right?</font>

174
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:42,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry. My friend's a tad homophobic,</font>

175
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I was doing a bit.</font>

176
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty exciting first half.</font>

177
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, 0-0. Electrifying.</font>

178
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw. Worried that your six-headed
ball and chain</font>

179
00:07:58,538 --> 00:07:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be calling?</font>

180
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:00,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

181
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's better, you big slut.</font>

182
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Chang!</font>

183
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang? Why?</font>

184
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know!</font>

185
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hear you guys.</font>

186
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, Chang,</font>

187
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how do you know where I live?</font>

188
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can answer both of those questions</font>

189
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">by returning your driver's license.</font>

190
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

191
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is!</font>

192
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man U. versus Liverpool!</font>

193
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">For God's sake, just let him in.</font>

194
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:37,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wearing the right colors
and everything.</font>

195
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:39,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come in.
- Don't mind if I Chang!</font>

196
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh heh. Hey, man, check this out.</font>

197
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ya-haa!</font>

198
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!</font>

199
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, the thing I was going
to show you guys</font>

200
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">is pretty cool.</font>

201
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ignoring you and watching soccer.</font>

202
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just sit down, Chang.</font>

203
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's space for three fannies
on this sofa.</font>

204
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. In England,
fanny means vagina, right?</font>

205
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:08,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">In England, everything means vagina.</font>

206
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make it up to you, Winger.</font>

207
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though, like I said,
weird place to put a lamp.</font>

208
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But let me order a pizza.
- Ooh, I love pizza!</font>

209
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">In england we call them Italian fannies.</font>

210
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:21,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm hookin' us up!</font>

211
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cellie...
- Ah. Go use the landline.</font>

212
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:27,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Landline? Okay, grandma Bell.</font>

213
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-burns, it's Chang.</font>

214
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that pizza you owe me?</font>

215
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's time to pay up.</font>

216
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Party at Winger's. Tonight.</font>

217
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you can tell people.</font>

218
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Cool.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, wingding at Winger's.</font>

220
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Mariah, what you get with me</font>

221
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the complete package...</font>

222
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:52,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">HBO, Showtime, Starz, Starz black.</font>

223
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds expensive.</font>

224
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all due respect to my friend here,</font>

225
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you go with me,</font>

226
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can expect this on the dance floor.</font>

00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go, go, go.</font>

228

<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I care.</font>

231
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:14,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, of course they're staring.</font>

232
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've probably never seen</font>

233
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">a straight girl and a lesbian
so comfortable together.</font>

234

<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

235
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those two were talking about us.</font>

236
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's give them something
to really talk about.</font>

237
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do it.
- Okay.</font>

238
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:33,725

00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool music, huh?</font>

241
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice call, ref!</font>

242
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bite my banger!</font>

243
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, something's up
with your toothbrush, man.</font>

244
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell?
- I had to get cleaned up.</font>

245
00:10:58,903 --> 00:10:59,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

246
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah!</font>

247
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:05,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pizza time!</font>

248
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leonard?
- Where are the white women at?</font>

249
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. There are no white
women here, Leonard.</font>

250
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a party!</font>

251
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell that to Magnitude.</font>

252
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:14,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Magnitude?</font>

253
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,105

<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in. What's up, what's up?</font>

259
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up? Looking good, looking good.</font>

260
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:28,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my analysis of
the Saw movie franchise.</font>

261
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">That about does it,</font>

262
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:32,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I think it's time for you to choose.</font>

263
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, could you get us some punch?</font>

264
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:38,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">On it.</font>

265
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are really cute together.</font>

266
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:44,278

<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually choose, I...</font>

269
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. We both agreed to this.</font>

270
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're both very comfortable
with each other,</font>

271
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- so I won't be...
- No. I choose you, Troy.</font>

272
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:56,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punch.</font>

273
00:11:58,063 --> 00:11:59,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Abed.
- Hey.</font>

274
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:00,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, um...</font>

275
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">She... Just... She chose me.</font>

276
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. You can have this then.</font>

277
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Mariah. Have a great night.</font>

278
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great!</font>

279
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

280
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go straight to hell!</font>

281
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:22,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I've been... I don't know.</font>

285
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been going through
all these mood swings lately.</font>

286
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:32,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand we care about you, right?</font>

287
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

288
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

289
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look.</font>

290
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:39,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the deal.</font>

291
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:43,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not sharing you with them.</font>

292
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">So before this goes further,</font>

293
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:47,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have a choice to make, my friend.</font>

294
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:53,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha! Look at the lesbians.</font>

295
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:57,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lesbians!</font>

296
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:58,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Screw you!
- Screw you!</font>

297
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:04,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

298
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't care what they say.
- Oh, I don't either.</font>

299
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wish it wasn't
such an issue for them.</font>

300
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but that starts with us.</font>

301
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It starts... With us.</font>

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've never done this before.
- Me neither.</font>

303
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! What?</font>

304
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:35,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

305
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curious about one thing.</font>

306
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:41,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was wrong with Abed?</font>

307
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, he did talk
about the Saw movies</font>

308
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">for two hours.</font>

309
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:46,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but there are eight of them,</font>

310
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:48,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're two hours apiece,</font>

311
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the first one did redefine
the genre, and...</font>

312
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:52,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I would love to be his friend.</font>

313
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:53,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you would. It's incredible.</font>

314
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">But romantically, he's...</font>

315
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.</font>

316
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her!</font>

317
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- She called you weird!</font>

318
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am weird.
- Not as weird as her!</font>

319
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell is Nicholas Nickleby?</font>

320
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:13,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wouldn't shut up about it.</font>

321
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. I know.</font>

322
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone out there for us.</font>

323
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Valentine's Day.</font>

324
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:23,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is now.</font>

325
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:34,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ignore her.
- Okay.</font>

326
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's weird, but I've never heard
of Magnitude</font>

327
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:40,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">before tonight.</font>

328
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a one-man party!</font>

329
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're always busy with your study group.</font>

330
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's not with them tonight.</font>

331
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah!</font>

332
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you quit drinking, Duncan.</font>

333
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">False alarm on that one.</font>

334
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah!</font>

335
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop, pop!</font>

336
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ho! Pop, pop!</font>

337
00:14:57,058 --> 00:15:01,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!
- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!</font>

338
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said I was a lesbian.</font>

339
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you just ask me?</font>

340
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what am I, a homophobe?</font>

341
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about people's preferences.</font>

342
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You so care.</font>

343
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are clearly just hanging out with me</font>

344
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you thought I was gay.</font>

345
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">So? What were you doing with me?</font>

346
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what does it matter, you know?</font>

347
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:21,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're both just humans</font>

348
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to make our way through
this crazy world.</font>

349
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst!</font>

350
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- And for the record,</font>

351
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought you were cool.</font>

352
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only thought you were a lesbian.</font>

353
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:40,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Page is straight.</font>

354
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:43,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

355
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

356
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she was gay</font>

357
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:49,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was really cool of you
to make out with her.</font>

358
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Annie.</font>

359
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:55,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kiss!</font>

360
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:58,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie!</font>

361
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:06,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks, man. Just leave those.</font>

362
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:08,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll get them in the morning.
- It's okay.</font>

363
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you wearing my underwear?</font>

364
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:15,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I just needed a pair while
I did some laundry here.</font>

365
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:16,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a washing machine.</font>

366
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

367
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:22,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get mad,
don't get mad!</font>

368
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm homeless, Jeff, okay?</font>

369
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">When my wife found out
about Shirley and me,</font>

370
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">she kicked me out...
For good this time!</font>

371
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">My whole life is in this dishwasher, man!</font>

372
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, some of it's also soaking
in your bathtub.</font>

373
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:38,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

374
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:40,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">So wasted and sleepy.</font>

375
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could probably just crash here
and, you know,</font>

376
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can start looking for a place
in the morning.</font>

377
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... You orchestrated
this entire party</font>

378
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so you could weasel
your way into staying here!</font>

379
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't even going to notice.</font>

380
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:54,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff, don't kill the messenger,</font>

381
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you have four hermit crabs
in your bathroom sink.</font>

382
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll fall in love with them.
I named one Jeff.</font>

383
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long did you actually think
you were gonna stay here?</font>

384
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a month. Three... Tops.</font>

385
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean... how long is your lease?</font>

386
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go, idiots!</font>

387
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody out.</font>

388
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:26,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not kidding.</font>

389
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been very interesting</font>

390
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting to know you all much, much better.</font>

391
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-burns, Leonard, Magnitude.</font>

392
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop, pop</font>

393
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">swizzle, scandalous, C Dubb, Tim.</font>

394
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:41,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mighty D. Glisten.</font>

395
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, everyone. Faster. Move it.</font>

396
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:44,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

397
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:46,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

398
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:48,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you found tonight therapeutic,</font>

399
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:51,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I would love to pretend
that that was my plan.</font>

400
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I actually started to have fun</font>

401
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">until that maniac tried to move in.</font>

402
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:58,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it about me that makes
broken people flock to me?</font>

403
00:17:58,807 --> 00:17:59,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it my height?</font>

404
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do huddled masses mistake me
for the Statue of Liberty?</font>

405
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:03,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

406
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">But being as how you're halfway through</font>

407
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">your second year at Greendale,
you may want to</font>

408
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">either stop resisting</font>

409
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">or admit that you're actually
starting to enjoy it.</font>

410
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you assume I enjoy it</font>

411
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:16,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you think you'd enjoy it.</font>

412
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true. I am very lonely.</font>

413
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a, uh, nice little taste</font>

414
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">of what you're missing in a relationship</font>

415
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">with six nutcases?</font>

416
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Let's turn on my phone</font>

417
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and listen to the 39 messages</font>

418
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">they left tonight.</font>

419
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no new messages.</font>

420
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. That's...</font>

421
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

422
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since you've got it turned on,</font>

423
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't you call me a cab
and then pay for it?</font>

424
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have been some kind of trouble.</font>

425
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:50,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...</font>

426
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a relief that would be.</font>

427
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what, if you need me,</font>

428
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be waiting for my cab down here.</font>

429
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having a special nap.</font>

430
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:13,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

431
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, bro. I'll be gone in the morning.</font>

432
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:32,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Whatever.</font>

433
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Maybe I stay a while.</font>

434
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thirsty.
- Don't push it.</font>

435
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:41,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right...</font>

436
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might not shock you guys
to hear the real reason</font>

437
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">we had a fight today...</font>

438
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:49,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't about the Barenaked Ladies.</font>

439
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although I do have some
unresolved issues there.</font>

440
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:55,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caring about a person can be scary.</font>

441
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caring about six people can be
a horrifying embarrassing nightmare.</font>

442
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least for me.</font>

443
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I can't say it today,</font>

444
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">when can I say it?</font>

445
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, guys.</font>

446
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, Pierce...</font>

447
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:09,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it from an expert...</font>

448
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">These knuckleheads
are right outside your heart.</font>

449
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them in.</font>

450
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before it's too late.</font>

451
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:19,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Valentine's Day.</font>

452
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Be mine?
- Right! Yes!</font>

453
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Love you.
- Amazing!</font>

454
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're cute?</font>

455
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:44,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait.</font>

456
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kiss me.
- There has got to be a way</font>
