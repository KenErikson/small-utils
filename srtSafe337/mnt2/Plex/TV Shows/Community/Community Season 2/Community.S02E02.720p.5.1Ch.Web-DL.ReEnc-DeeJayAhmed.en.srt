00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Did you know that go-gurt
is just yogurt?</font>

150
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what a therapist calls
this kind of a relationship, right?</font>

151
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gold mine.</font>

152
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:10,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Codependent.</font>

153
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys don't want me to be happy.
You want me to need you.</font>

154
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting a little claustrophobic.
I used to run full-speed</font>

155
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">through the boundless wilderness,
and now I'm in the zoo,</font>

156
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the horizon is wallpaper
and the air is stale</font>

157
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nothing is ever at stake.</font>

158
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">In other words, we're not cool.</font>

159
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said it. You may have heard it.
I may have thought it,</font>

160
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it may be true.
But I never said it.</font>

161
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, will we see you tomorrow night,
at the pop-and-lock-a-thon?</font>

162
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Abed, I'm going to a cool party
at my cool former law firm</font>

163
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">from when my life was cool.</font>

164
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
You can be on the team.</font>

165
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:48,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">New deal.</font>

166
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we win,
I get to be in the study group.</font>

167
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stakes have never been higher.</font>

168
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna thank everybody for coming.</font>

169
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I became a lawyer,</font>

170
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a dream.</font>

171
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a dream that one day
I'd be head of a firm</font>

172
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">so nobody would be able to talk
about the big, weird hole in my hand.</font>

173
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know everybody talks about it
behind my back, and that's OK.</font>

174
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I would.</font>

175
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's great, though,
is that you don't stare</font>

176
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">or ask any questions.</font>

177
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as a reward for your restraint,</font>

178
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">got a little something for you.</font>

179
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

180
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">That oughta keep you going
to Christmas. Have fun tonight!</font>

181
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone else with that hand
would wear a glove.</font>

182
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">He controls a room with it.</font>

183
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:42,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the master.</font>

184
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he sure is a fan of yours.</font>

185
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:49,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, when you talk to him,</font>

186
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:52,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you mention me?
He keeps passing me over for partner.</font>

187
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, did you invite me here
with an ulterior motive?</font>

188
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:58,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I miss this place!</font>

189
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it's a sea of Wingers.</font>

190
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole place reeks
of moral ambiguity.</font>

191
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:09,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, that was me.
I apologize.</font>

192
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you guys are new
to high society,</font>

193
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">so just... follow my lead,
everything will be fine.</font>

194
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, why are you here?
Second, I don't care. Leave.</font>

195
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a matter of fact, Jeff,
we were invited.</font>

196
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone do that?</font>

197
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you guys made it!</font>

198
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in.</font>

199
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:38,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, before this gets more embarrassing,
what is your misguided plan?</font>

200
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">To apologize to you
for casting aspersions</font>

201
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on your friend.
- And to show you we can be cool.</font>

202
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is that Jeff Winger?</font>

203
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find Annie and leave.</font>

204
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:51,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ted! Hey man!</font>

205
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:52,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on?
- Wow.</font>

206
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:56,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once Annie gets Alan's office number,
you guys break into his office,</font>

207
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">hack into his emails,</font>

208
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">and find proof
that he screwed Jeff over.</font>

209
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:04,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fourth floor. 470.</font>

210
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">First he said it was 69.</font>

211
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna rub purell on my brain.</font>

212
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so missed here, Jeff.
If we had five guys with your balls,</font>

213
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- we wouldn't need 30 lawyers.
- True, but we'd need a good doctor.</font>

214
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ted, stop hittin' on my date.</font>

215
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kidding.
We can share.</font>

216
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:26,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get the head!</font>

217
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love the brain in there!</font>

218
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll eat it.</font>

219
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, Jeff Winger's here!</font>

220
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't we notify someone</font>

221
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">that our team's not gonna make it
to the pop-and-lock-a-thon?</font>

222
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You actually think anybody cares?</font>

223
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checking in
for the Heather Pop and Locklears.</font>

224
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the rest of your team?
- They'll be here.</font>

225
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:54,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. You are allowed to start by yourself,
but you won't stand a chance</font>

226
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if you don't have someone...
- They'll be here!</font>

227
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:10,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought stuff
people use for capers.</font>

the chloroform does.</font>

231
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, go back and keep lookout.</font>

232
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:23,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why me lookout?
Why not you?</font>

233
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause if someone comes up here,
Kanye and Kumar get taken to jail.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- You, get taken to dinner.
- You guys!</font>

235
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the smartest one in this group,</font>

236
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:34,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all I've been used
for is bait and distraction.</font>

237
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on your stupid mission.
I hope it sucks.</font>

238
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did she say?
- I dunno.</font>

239
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I heard was suck.</font>

240
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised
Alan hasn't made partner yet.</font>

241
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised I haven't fired him.</font>

242
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? I mean,
he's got a better win record than I do.</font>

243
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a spineless trust fund jagoff.</font>

244
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what, Jeff.
You're the best liar I ever employed.</font>

245
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can look me in the eye,</font>

246
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell me you actually like Alan,</font>

247
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:01,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make him a full partner.</font>

248
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only ever really liked one person.</font>

249
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:07,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mom.</font>

250
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... she liked my dad.</font>

251
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after all the dust
and custody was settled,</font>

252
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">the guy I really admired,
not liked, admired,</font>

253
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:19,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the lawyer leaving the courthouse
in the great-looking suit</font>

- Sweet job.</font>

256
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet life.
He didn't care, he couldn't care.</font>

257
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the less he cared,
the better he was.</font>

258
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are a special breed</font>

259
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we rise above
the sloppy stuff</font>

260
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">and look at the bottom line.</font>

261
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna like your employees?
Open a hair salon.</font>

262
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna win?
Make Alan partner.</font>

263
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">The student has become the master.</font>

264
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:45,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jeff.</font>

265
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make me wanna be a worse man.</font>

266
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:53,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, just 'cause you can't work cases here
doesn't mean you can't work.</font>

267
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:54,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, be a consultant.</font>

268
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ted, that would be amazing.</font>

269
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:00,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

270
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Jeff, I'm sure you know Philip.</font>

271
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:08,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that if I sleep
with Philip once a month,</font>

272
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:12,010

in Rio whenever I want?</font>

273
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

274
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are really on to something.</font>

275
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you found
the world's newest profession.</font>

276
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys guys, did you know I have a civil case,</font>

277
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">against that bitch
that stole my husband?</font>

278
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,969

279
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,619

Where's Pierce?</font>

281
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I even worried about him?</font>

282

<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know there's an island in Indonesia
where you can hunt people?</font>

283
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:36,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk.</font>

284
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think this is it.
- Print it.</font>

285
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice</font>

286
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:43,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me!</font>

287
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you, guys?
This is not your office.</font>

288
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:47,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can explain.</font>

289
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me explain.</font>

290
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god.</font>

291
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:12,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't know what to do.
- Oh my God!</font>

292
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I usually have one foot out of reality,
and even I'm freaking out right now.</font>

293
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You chloroformed the janitor?</font>

294
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop yelling at me! You are the ones you got caught!
- You're the one who's yelling!</font>

295
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in big trouble!
We have to do something!</font>

296
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what to do.
My whole brain is crying!</font>

297
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys! guys! guys!</font>

298
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I have an idea.</font>

299
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, it may sound a little weird,
but trust me.</font>

300
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:45,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

301
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:49,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all got chloroformed!</font>

302
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody chloroformed all of us.</font>

303
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now we're regaining consciousness. Together.</font>

304
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:59,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.
Who's she?</font>

305
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is she holding a rag?</font>

306
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, that was the worst idea ever.
Can we please, just run away now?</font>

307
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the fourth straight hour,</font>

308
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:28,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Ben Chang is still on his own.</font>

309
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:32,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">One can only imagine
what is driving him to...</font>

310
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">push himself to such limits!</font>

311
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:49,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">My body hurts.</font>

312
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">My body hurts.</font>

313
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:56,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You jealous because we're fitting in
with your cool friends?</font>

314
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm distracted,
watching you mutate.</font>

315
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you're not a whore.</font>

316
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:03,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, Jesus turned the other cheek.
He didn't garnish wages.</font>

317
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce. Do I even need to say this?
It is bad to hunt man for sport.</font>

318
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:08,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad ass.</font>

319
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the email
that Alan sent the bar association.</font>

320
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:18,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stabbed you in the back, Jeff.
He's a bad friend.</font>

321
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

322
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a bad friend.</font>

323
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he is a good lawyer.</font>

324
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I appreciate you guys caring,</font>

325
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you have to understand
that I don't.</font>

326
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caring is lethal around here.</font>

327
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a disease.</font>

328
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys have it.
I don't.</font>

329
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you do care about me,
don't infect me.</font>

330
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go win that pop-and-lock-a-thon.</font>

331
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you Monday.</font>

332
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like watching a soul
slip through our fingers.</font>

333
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what more can we do?</font>

334
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:00,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you stop?</font>

335
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tango.</font>

336
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:07,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how you did it, man...</font>

337
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:09,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're looking at
the firm's next partner.</font>

338
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wasn't actively repressing
my bi-curiosity,</font>

339
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:14,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would kiss your beautiful mouth.</font>

340
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you can return the favor one day.</font>

341
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe, I can return it right now.</font>

342
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably know that someone here
at the firm turned you in.</font>

343
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, this is really hard.</font>

344
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
You can tell me.</font>

345
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Thompson.</font>

346
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thompson.
- Yeah.</font>

347
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thompson, that adopted three at-risk teens</font>

348
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">and donated his kidney to a temp.</font>

349
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">All an act.</font>

350
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:53,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, why do you think he quit
right after you left?</font>

351
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... his wife died.</font>

352
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she, Jeff?</font>

353
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did...</font>

354
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:00,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">she?</font>

355
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:03,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway... congrats.</font>

356
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go do some shots with Phil.</font>

357
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you go ahead, I...</font>

358
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I caught something
at Greendale.</font>

359
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:14,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">College chicks.
I get ya!</font>

360
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're bad!</font>

361
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shamone... It hurts.
Shamone...</font>

362
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hurts!
Shamone... It hurts!</font>

363
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben, switch up your moves.</font>

364
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, do my eyes deceive me?</font>

365
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy Barnes
baggin' in for the save.</font>

366
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:44,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only two teams left.</font>

367
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Poppy Lockstockings,
and the Heather Pop and Locklears!</font>

368
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy, what's wrong?
- I don't know.</font>

369
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">My heart's just not in it.</font>

370
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should quit. I mean,
who even cares about this anyway?</font>

371
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next stop looks like Jeffrey Winger.</font>

372
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, you're back!</font>

373
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you miss me?
- Took you long enough.</font>

374
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we got it.</font>

375
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, did you punch Alan
in his rotten face</font>

376
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and storm out?
- Hell no, that guy's useful to me.</font>

377
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to you, I've now got leverage</font>

378
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">over a spineless jag
that just made partner.</font>

379
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the place I want to work.</font>

380
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:28,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I prefer to hang out
with cool people, people so cool...</font>

381
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:29,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">They care.</font>

382
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, the puppet.</font>

383
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">No parking
on the dance floor, Winger.</font>

384
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:52,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm serious, you're disqualified.
The winners are the Poppy Lockstockings!</font>

385
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrific!</font>

386
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

387
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I been popping and locking
for five hours,</font>

388
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you threw it all away!</font>

389
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The contest doesn't matter.</font>

390
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's important
is we have each other.</font>

391
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:10,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, can I be in your study group?</font>

392
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that wasn't the deal.</font>

393
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost, so...</font>

394
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was dope, what we did.
- That was so good!</font>

395
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The puppet too!
- The puppet was so...</font>

396
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rolled my ankle during that.</font>

397
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, he's bringing us down.
Let's move him. Can we move him?</font>

398
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tsss, Troy.</font>

399
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me.</font>

400
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:43,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

401
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:46,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it through!
I'm a cartoon now.</font>

402
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:49,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible in here.</font>

403
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Animals can talk.
Your heart is shaped like a heart.</font>

404
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the smell of pie
can make you float.</font>

405
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to believe, Troy.</font>

406
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:00,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait! You don't have to believe.
- I didn't.</font>

407
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

408
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have done some damage there.</font>
