Are you cutting me out of the group?</font>

125
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,459

127

131
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,475

that opportunity already?</font>

132
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but there's
a very specific reason.</font>

133

<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumb name. I'm gonna take his sword.
Can I take his sword?</font>

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got his sword.</font>

147
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, knock it off.</font>

148
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're playing the game wrong.
- We'll see.</font>

149
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, I take the Duquesne sword
from the naked man.</font>

150
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I attack him!
I attack black face!</font>

151
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a critical hit.
- What?</font>

152
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:26,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've decapitated him.
Brutalitops is dead.</font>

153
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

154
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask
for your character sheet.</font>

155
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Still your turn.
- I run.</font>

156
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You run?</font>

157
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">The naked man
is running into the woods.</font>

158
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But he has my sword.
- Can we catch him, please?</font>

159
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cloak that Duquesne gave him
was an elven cloak of windwalking,</font>

160
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is double speed, so, no.
He's gone.</font>

161
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

162
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took me ten years
and 50 campaigns to get that sword.</font>

163
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:12,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

164
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll wipe my ass with it
and throw it off a cliff.</font>

165
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's for sitting here, Fatty.</font>

166
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it that means I'm winning.</font>

167
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:32,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you've made your point.
You can ruin anything.</font>

168
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now come back
and give Neil his sword.</font>

169
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:37,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hear you over the sound
of me rubbing his sword on my balls.</font>

170
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have...</font>

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Successfully rubbed your balls
on the sword.</font>

172
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't help him.
You're the dungeon master.</font>

173
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kill Pierce and give Neil back
his sword. He's upset.</font>

174
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to be impartial,
or the game has no meaning.</font>

175
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you just give Neil a new sword?
- That sword is one of a kind.</font>

176
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was forged by my ancestors.
- I hump it.</font>

177
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Pierce, Abed,
I need to have a talk with you?</font>

178
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

179
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:06,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That kid is severely depressed.
- Oh, yeah, is that what he told you?</font>

180
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the looks of it, he's been using
that line since he was five years old</font>

181
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get an extra slice of pie.</font>

182
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is wrong with you?</font>

183
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like being excluded, Jeff!
Do you?</font>

184
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go in there and tell him
you're giving him his sword,</font>

185
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you are out of the study group.</font>

186
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of you threatening me</font>

187
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">and talking to me like a kid</font>

188
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">and giving me that look you give me
like I can't get erections!</font>

189
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Abed, I keep running.</font>

190
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since you're working against the group,
I need to separate you from them.</font>

191
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Who wants to sit
with a bunch of fat crybabies anyway?</font>

192
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me when you're ready
for my next move.</font>

193
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:44,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce refuses
to give back the sword.</font>

194
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our new goal
is to find him and kill him.</font>

195
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think I just want to go home.
- Neil, do not do that.</font>

196
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:55,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get that sword back.
Now, is there a way of moving faster</font>

197
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:57,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">than he's moving
in his cape of whatever?</font>

198
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:03,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I guess if we had a Pegasus.
- If that's sarcasm, I can't tell.</font>

199
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because everything in this game
is silly.</font>

200
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:09,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, can we get a Pegasus?
- I can't give you information.</font>

201
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:12,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's got to be
a town nearby.</font>

202
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will go to that town
and ask around...</font>

203
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a Pegasus!</font>

204
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right?</font>

205
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,445
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And so it was that the group</i></font>

206
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,931
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>began to describe
themselves walking.</i></font>

207
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,291
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And as they described
themselves walking,</i></font>

208
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,548
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so did Abed confirm
that they walked...</i></font>

209
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I walk with them.
- <i>... until...</i></font>

210
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:34,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a local elf tavern,
but all races are welcome.</font>

211
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a crowded and rowdy evening.</font>

212
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:40,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beleaguered gnomes hurry to and fro
with glasses of mead for elves.</font>

213
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:42,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they beleaguered?</font>

214
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?</font>

215
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find a waiter
and introduce myself.</font>

216
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why is he a pirate?
- He's a gnome.</font>

217
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody here speak gnome?</font>

218
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:55,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lavernica does.</font>

219
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">This'll be painless.</font>

220
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, my friend and brother.
- How can I help you, dear madam?</font>

221
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, no need for such deference.
I am no better than a gnome.</font>

222
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are, madam.
You are a human warrior,</font>

223
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:10,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is five species classes
greater than I.</font>

224
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's disgusting.
Don't talk like that.</font>

225
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sorry, madam!</font>

226
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't report me
for execution!</font>

227
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean that.</font>

228
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have got to do something
about these gnomes.</font>

229
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:23,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, ask the stupid gnome
where we can get a Pegasus!</font>

230
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone say "Pegasus"?</font>

231
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">A word I understand
in every language?</font>

232
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:35,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's all the <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> stuff
I could find.</font>

233
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to carry it
all the way from my car.</font>

234
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very heavy,
and my doctor said...</font>

235
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Following the directions,</font>

236
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">you arrive at a field
full of Pegasi.</font>

237
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they are guarded by a mysterious
and beautiful elf maiden,</font>

238
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">who seems drawn to marrrrrr.</font>

239
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I explain
that we need a Pegasus,</font>

240
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">and promise to fill it up
before we bring it back.</font>

241
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She flirts with you.
- I flirt back.</font>

242
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How?
- I say something sexy.</font>

243
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

244
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, I don't normally do this,</font>

245
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're the most beautiful creature
I've ever seen,</font>

246
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:26,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I would love a Pegasus.</font>

247
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Works for me.</font>

248
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very handsome.</font>

249
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:34,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not really comfortable
with this.</font>

250
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">My stable has a bedding of heather.
You'd be more comfortable indoors.</font>

251
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:40,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at what you're doing
and understand that I don't want to.</font>

252
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've offended the elf maiden.
She's disinterested in you.</font>

253
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

254
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just do this?</font>

255
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.
I am Hector the well-endowed.</font>

256
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a bunch of Pegasi.
Let's make a deal.</font>

257
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of deal?</font>

258
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I take her by the hand
and lead her to the stable.</font>

259
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:00,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rip off a piece of my tunic,
which I fashion into a blindfold.</font>

260
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hector, but I don't know...</font>

261
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I place it gently
over the elf maiden's eyes.</font>

262
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You both fall back,
exhausted but still entwined.</font>

263
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stroke her hair and spoon her
for the appropriate time before leaving.</font>

264
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long is that?</font>

265
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:44,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The elf maiden, thoroughly satisfied,
promises you a flock of Pegasi.</font>

266
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

267
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a break.
I should check on Pierce.</font>

268
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here.</font>

269
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:00,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know
what you want to do next.</font>

270
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many things, Abed.</font>

271
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many things.</font>

272
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:10,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys...</font>

273
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am bringing Pierce back
into the room.</font>

274
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because while soaring
above the forest of Ingold,</font>

275
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">you spot his body in an elven cloak
in a clearing below.</font>

276
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got you!</font>

277
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We land.
- You land in the wooded clearing.</font>

278
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is face-down,
a pool of blood underneath him.</font>

279
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you how long
I've dreamed of this, in the game.</font>

280
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neil's sword?</font>

281
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clutched in the hand of the body
is the sword of Duquesne.</font>

282
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I believe this is yours.</font>

283
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get close enough
to take the sword,</font>

284
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can see that this body,
while definitely dying,</font>

285
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- is not Pierce.
- What?</font>

286
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I turn it over.
- It's the gnome waiter from the tavern.</font>

287
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No. Why?</font>

288
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, my friend.</font>

289
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for being
so respectful toward me.</font>

290
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who did this to you?
- I never saw his face.</font>

291
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know...</font>

292
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">my name...</font>

293
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:05,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">was Kyle.</font>

294
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle.</font>

295
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was an imaginary waiter.</font>

296
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't expect you to understand.</font>

297
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

298
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:24,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear a low rumble,
followed by a shrill screech</font>

299
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the beating of heavy wings
against the sky.</font>

300
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wings?</font>

301
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:29,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

302
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Abed,</font>

303
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:35,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you familiar with the Amburg region
of the Edylmann river basin?</font>

304
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:36,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

305
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll know
there's a reflecting pool</font>

306
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a very special amulet
at the bottom of it.</font>

307
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">An amulet that allows the wearer</font>

308
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">full control over...</font>

309
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draconis!</font>

310
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hideous Draconis,
an all-powerful red dragon,</font>

311
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">crashes through the trees
into the clearing.</font>

312
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riding atop his shoulders,
naked as the day he was born,</font>

313
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:59,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">and controlling Draconis
with the amulet is...</font>

314
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:00,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it!</font>

315
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne.</font>

316
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scream what I told you to scream!</font>

317
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce Hawthorne is my master!</font>

318
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare to meet your doom!</font>

319
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I run towards Pierce
with my broadsword drawn, I attack...</font>

320
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time stop!</font>

321
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Time stop"?</font>

322
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draconis has tons of spells.
You are frozen and helpless.</font>

323
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:26,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why I wanted to play
<i>Chutes & Ladders</i>.</font>

324
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, Pierce, you win.
Just kill us and end this.</font>

325
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing is too good for you.</font>

326
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:35,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cast "shape change" on Duquesne.</font>

327
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What shape do you choose for him?
- Fat.</font>

328
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:41,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

329
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duquesne starts gaining weight.</font>

330
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How much?
- Make him as fat as Fat Neil.</font>

331
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:49,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, cry.</font>

332
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it out.</font>

333
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:56,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baste your chubby cheeks
in tears of gravy.</font>

334
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't crying
when you were stealing my friends.</font>

335
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:01,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">They asked me to come here.</font>

336
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why?</font>

337
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got some fat news, Fat Neil.</font>

338
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:10,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know why Jeff Winger,
of all people,</font>

339
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">led the charge
on the "Fat Neil feel good" committee?</font>

340
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way over the line!</font>

341
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you why.</font>

342
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I was there.</font>

343
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the bathrooms?</font>

344
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're down there by Fat Neil.</font>

345
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Neil.</font>

346
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your new best friend, Jeff Winger,</font>

347
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">coined the name "fat Neil".</font>

348
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you respond,
I can make it up to you.</font>

349
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find a fatter Neil.</font>

350
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made up "Fat Neil"?</font>

351
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone asked where the restrooms were,
and you were standing by them,</font>

352
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:59,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you were also standing
kind of near other Neil.</font>

353
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So call him skinny Neil.
- He's not that skinny.</font>

354
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's bald!
He's black!</font>

355
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't look at the world
through that lens.</font>

356
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:09,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I shouldn't be high-roading you.
I'm the bad guy.</font>

357
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you can all hang out
in suspended humiliation</font>

358
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">and think
about what you learned today.</font>

359
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">One,</font>

360
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't screw with me.</font>

361
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, invite me to your crap.</font>

362
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:26,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it my turn?
- Yes, but you can't move.</font>

363
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fine.</font>

364
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my turn,
I feel sorry for Pierce Hawthorne.</font>

365
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:33,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it.</font>

366
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I really do.
- Good.</font>

367
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:38,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my turn,
I rape the Duquesne family, again.</font>

368
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:42,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">For my turn, I pity Pierce too.</font>

369
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, kitten,
I'm having the time of my life.</font>

370
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:46,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won.</font>

371
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:50,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>,
and it was advanced.</font>

372
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I pity Pierce.
- Knock it off.</font>

373
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You outdid yourself this week.
There's a lot of pain in you.</font>

374
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:58,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel bad.
- Feel sorry for your new fat BFF.</font>

375
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're done doing that.
He's gonna be fine, aren't you?</font>

376
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, Pierce,</font>

377
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really worry about,
at least for my turn, anyway.</font>

378
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about this?
Draconis, unfreeze time.</font>

379
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.
You can move again.</font>

380
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I breathe so much fire on you...
- Hold it.</font>

381
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just used
your move unfreezing time.</font>

382
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:18,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take the sword of Duquesne,</font>

383
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:21,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I throw it at the amulet
around the sad, naked man's neck.</font>

384
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a difficult shot.
You'll need an 18 or higher.</font>

385
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet baby Jesus.</font>

386
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

387
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sword smashes the amulet,
freeing Draconis from its spell.</font>

388
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:45,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">The red dragon grabs Pierce in his jaws,
and swallows him alive.</font>

389
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:50,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a reward, he flies your band</font>

390
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">to his cavern
where he bestows his treasure upon you.</font>

391
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations on the completion
of Cavern of Draconis.</font>

392
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been your dungeon master.
I hope you had a good time.</font>

393
00:19:59,042 --> 00:19:59,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excelsior.</font>

394
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:14,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the best game
I ever played in my life.</font>

395
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't mention it.
- Want to play again next week?</font>

396
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

397
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:22,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be around.</font>

398
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:25,385
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And so it was that Pierce Hawthorne</i></font>

399
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,361
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>saved the life of Fat Neil,</i></font>

400
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:30,823
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>while learning very, very little.</i></font>

401
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:33,612
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Good night.</i></font>

402
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you possibly want
giant ears over a tail?</font>

403
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had a tail,
people could tell when you're happy.</font>

404
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with giant ears,
you could hear far.</font>

405
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could wear backpacks,
which would free up your hands.</font>

406
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Backpacks already free up your hands.
Guys, what do you think?</font>

407
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought our group
was meeting now.</font>

408
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tail is much better.</font>

409
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- All in favor of giant ears?</font>

410
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told you.</font>
