<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why they call me bus driver, right?</font>

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:08,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you been
travelin' all day?</font>

4
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:10,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm taking
your butt to school.</font>

5
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:14,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

6
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:16,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, I'm up.</font>

- Since you scored 11.</font>

finish kicking Troy's butt</font>

11
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,339

14
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:28,184

about stuff like that</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, no!</font>

22
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:41,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna find our
roots in that class.</font>

23
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And stop defining our
gender by theirs.</font>

24
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:45,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I feel bad saying it,</font>

25
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it will be nice to
get away from the boys</font>

26
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">and take a class with just us.</font>

29
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:54,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it in for a
boob bump, ladies.</font>

30
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...
Nope?</font>

31
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:58,322

were real cool?</font>

39
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got a built-in spy cam.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">100 yards.</font>

41
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,045

stupid cars' little butts.</font>

42
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:19,846

- Yeah.</font>

43
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're really not
into R.C. anymore.</font>

00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Pierce, man.
This is a school.</font>

46
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't control it.
- Watch it.</font>

47
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:33,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a little pilot in there.</font>

48
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:34,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not funny, Pierce!
- Propellers are sharp!</font>

49
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

50
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,290

be something just for the girls.</font>

That's the problem.</font>

111

112
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Meghan's the one

00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and no ankles?
- Ha! Damn.</font>

114
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I over-described again?</font>

115
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Abed.</font>

116
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:46,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Describe those girls all you want.</font>

117
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. In fact,
what are you doing for lunch?</font>

118
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,492

Sometimes I eat in Jeff's car.</font>

120
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, where are you?</font>

121
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would go this far

00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:05,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff!</font>

123
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this thing?</font>

124
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my line of work, a
multimillion dollar injury suit.</font>

125
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,653

rid of these things.</font>

126
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,144

Greendale allows it.</font>

127
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale doesn't.</font>

128
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:19,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why it's hidden.</font>

129
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else saw you come in?</font>

130
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we say nobody,</font>

131
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you doing to stab us
with your bush scissors?</font>

132
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:26,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not.</font>

133
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,854

<font color="#FFFFFF">A place free from darkness.</font>

137
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there's a trampoline?</font>

138
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is something cool
about being up here, Jeff.</font>

139
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, at first I was
just jumping, but then...</font>

140
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you started bouncing...</font>

141
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,011

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

144
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:52,376

145
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, one at a time, please.</font>

146

<font color="#FFFFFF">I must as you to adhere

00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:22,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside of time, outside of words...
Outside of everything.</font>

155
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">A perfect moment. A silent moment.</font>

156
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call it the world's whisper.</font>

157
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow... You're right.</font>

158
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:42,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't mind admitting
you're right, which is weird.</font>

159
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">30 seconds on this thing, and
I already feel... Jeff...</font>

160
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been up there for an hour.</font>

161
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:57,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

162
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Abed,
girl in the pink... go.</font>

163
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:06,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her forehead hangs over
her head like a canopy.</font>

164
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">She missed a belt loop, and her
stomach spills over her shorts.</font>

165
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Target destroyed.
- What brutality.</font>

166
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:14,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called a muffin top, Abed.</font>

167
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a muffin? Clever.</font>

168
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you guys said it's rude
to focus on imperfections.</font>

169
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">This the stuff I'm
supposed to filter, right?</font>

170
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, Abed.</font>

171
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just kind of
a guilty pleasure</font>

172
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hear it about... certain girls.</font>

173
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Meghan and her friends,
because they're bitches.</font>

174
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.
Uh, who needs a soda?</font>

175
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:31,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it...
I'm making you guys so happy,</font>

176
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to keep it going.</font>

177
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww...</font>

178
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:37,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I love Abed so much.</font>

179
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, it's like
he's one of the girls.</font>

180
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, guys.</font>

181
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, do you mind
not looking at me?</font>

182
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:46,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, do you
mind that your face makeup</font>

183
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't match your neck?</font>

184
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I squint,
you look like a circus clown.</font>

185
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I beg your pardon, geek...</font>

186
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know your
peanut-headed ass.</font>

187
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, we've never met.</font>

188
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like your hair and
dandruff shampoo.</font>

189
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoo hoo! Filet of Meghan,
service for one.</font>

190
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Abed,
let's get back to the table.</font>

191
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Abed. Go with your skank.</font>

192
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or keep going. Up to you.</font>

193
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep going about what,
her uneven bra padding?</font>

194
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like you're smuggling
a lime and a coconut.</font>

195
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh!
- Go away, loser.</font>

196
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good one... tell that to the
stitching on your ratty panties,</font>

197
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">or wear higher jeans
on laundry day.</font>

198
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, that diss made me snarf, yo!</font>

199
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? You're dead.</font>

200
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're bowlegged.</font>

201
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye. See ya.</font>

202
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women of Greendale!</font>

203
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:33,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cafeteria has been
declared a bitch-free zone!</font>

204
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

205
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't tell you how
great I feel right now.</font>

206
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure that you would
take to the trampoline's ways.</font>

207
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some can't.</font>

208
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some are just natural jumpers.</font>

209
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:05,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you tomorrow, Joshua.</font>

210
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">We better bounce.</font>

211
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

212
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Sharice.</font>

213
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had sociology
with her last year.</font>

214
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me I walk like a dude.</font>

215
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:22,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awful! Abed,
you got anything?</font>

216
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might have something to say
about those jeans she's wearing.</font>

217
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you guys are
sure it's not bad?</font>

218
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.</font>

219
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and you're
really good at it.</font>

220
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:31,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a machine.</font>

221
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like Robocop.
- Exactly like rowboat cop.</font>

222
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:37,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharice is a bad rowboat.
Sink her.</font>

223
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:39,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Affirmative.</font>

224
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:53,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're bad...</font>

225
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">bad.</font>

226
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:07,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey... You dudes ready to shoot
the rock after study group?</font>

227
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna slit your
butt's throats.</font>

228
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice catch, losers.</font>

229
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get it.</font>

230
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:16,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Pierce.</font>

231
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not really into
basketball anymore.</font>

232
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

233
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:20,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up with you guys?</font>

234
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you acting like that?</font>

235
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:23,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

236
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Gay boots!</font>

237
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady boots!</font>

238
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:29,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a gaywad.</font>

239
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are those as
comfortable as they look?</font>

240
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like wearing
a pair of dreams.</font>

241
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure your shoes
are fine, though.</font>

242
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:39,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

243
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are.</font>

244
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's up with you two,
and I want to know what it is.</font>

245
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you on weed?</font>

246
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me some... I'll smoke
you two under the table.</font>

247
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:49,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man, I feel so good.</font>

248
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like the whole
campus is a gutter</font>

249
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're just spraying it clean.</font>

250
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I may need you to
come to the bank with me</font>

251
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have words with a certain
something at window four.</font>

252
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:58,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll take 'em down.</font>

253
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll take all these bitches down.</font>

254
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies, are you okay?</font>

255
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:03,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy.</font>

256
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, did you just
tell us what to do?</font>

257
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:07,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing.</font>

258
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little rule.</font>

259
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:09,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're not familiar with it.</font>

260
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:11,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody tells me what to do... ever.</font>

261
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, cowboy. I surrender.</font>

262
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, did you hear that?</font>

263
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff a bitch too?
- Yes.</font>

264
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take him down.
- Cool.</font>

265
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jeff, what's with the boots?</font>

266
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">2008 called to tell you that,
even in 2008,</font>

267
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">those were tacky.
Oh, you go, girl!</font>

268
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daaamn.</font>

269
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you guys,
why don't we just all</font>

270
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">take a deep breath and...
Find some center.</font>

271
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that is it!</font>

272
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you hiding from me?</font>

273
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're keeping
relaxation secrets.</font>

274
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:40,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me how to get this laid back,
or I'll kill your families!</font>

275
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this place is lame.</font>

276
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, Abed.</font>

277
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toodles.</font>

278
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm watching you two.</font>

279
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:51,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">24, 2010.</font>

280
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">These balls on your butts.</font>

281
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick bounce before lunch?</font>

282
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

283
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me just make sure that
Pierce isn't hovering around.</font>

284
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:07,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coast is clear.</font>

285
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see, my pretty?</font>

286
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:44,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

287
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back, back... freeze it.</font>

288
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you blow that up
a little? Enhance.</font>

289
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enhance.</font>

290
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enhance.</font>

291
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! That's it.</font>

292
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blow it up.</font>

293
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is.</font>

294
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:03,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, excuse me, girls.</font>

295
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sitting in our seats.</font>

296
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:06,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. What did you say?</font>

297
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! I didn't know you were deaf.</font>

298
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:11,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suspected you were
blind from the outfit.</font>

299
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:14,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toodles.</font>

300
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:17,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">See ya.</font>

301
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

302
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:22,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why were you mean to them?
Did they insult you?</font>

303
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:25,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but that top
insulted our retinas.</font>

304
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, girl.</font>

305
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:31,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.</font>

306
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, when you laugh like that,
you snort like a piglet.</font>

307
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Careful, Abed.
- Be careful with your skin.</font>

308
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your face is so puffy right now,</font>

309
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">your eyes look like
sewn-on buttons.</font>

310
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to check that
attitude at the door, Abed.</font>

311
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to check the door before
you go through it, Shirley.</font>

312
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What?</font>

313
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, you cannot
talk to us that way.</font>

314
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has to.
You guys are being bitches.</font>

315
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not bitches!</font>

316
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:56,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just joking.</font>

317
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that makes us bitches,
we're all bitches.</font>

318
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- That's a good point, Annie.</font>

319
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:01,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told him.</font>

320
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Affirmative. You're all bitches.</font>

321
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice shirt. It would
look better on a girl.</font>

322
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick a bronzer.</font>

323
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not fooling us with that
band-aid... we knew it's a zit.</font>

324
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all bitches.
Triple bitches.</font>

325
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ohh!
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.</font>

326
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, bitch. Bitch. You bitch.</font>

327
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:14,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.</font>

328
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!</font>

329
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:24,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha!</font>

330
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you find us?</font>

331
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draganflyer, bee-otch.</font>

332
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is the big secret, huh?</font>

333
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two sneak out here and hang
out on the big, gay trampoline.</font>

334
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lower your voice, Pierce.</font>

335
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our place of peace.</font>

336
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And now it's mine too.</font>

337
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:42,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine.</font>

338
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:49,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is great!</font>

339
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna go higher!</font>

340
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:56,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce... Please...
You're doing it all wrong.</font>

341
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna go higher!</font>

342
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, get up here and
double bounce me.</font>

343
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how
we do things here.</font>

344
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get up here and
double bounce me,</font>

345
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll tell everybody
about this place!</font>

346
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

347
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">God is my witness,
I will tweet it!</font>

348
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:16,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double bounce me!</font>

349
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing this?</font>

350
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double bounce me! Do it!</font>

351
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, that's enough.</font>

352
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:23,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you.</font>

353
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you!</font>

354
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double bounce me!</font>

355
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

356
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father...</font>

357
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">My legs! Ohh!</font>

358
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my legs, I... illegal trampoline!</font>

359
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have an illegal
trampoline back there!</font>

360
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, black jeans? Nice try,
Michael Penn.</font>

361
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those bangs aren't covering
anything, five-head.</font>

362
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pegged jeans.
Sweater balls. Crows feet.</font>

363
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:53,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it called
when your back hair</font>

364
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:55,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">grows into your neck hair
grows into your regular hair?</font>

365
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:56,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look it up, because you have it.</font>

366
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

367
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. Who taught you how
to be a juice box? Hmm.</font>

368
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. I come in peace.</font>

369
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whatever medicated
shampoo you're using</font>

370
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">seems to be doing the trick.</font>

371
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. What do you want?</font>

372
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:23,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">To restore the natural order.</font>

373
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are these?</font>

374
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destruct codes.</font>

375
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that seems
a little excessive.</font>

376
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joshua.</font>

377
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were looking for you all over.</font>

378
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you going?</font>

379
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got fired. I'm leaving.</font>

380
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joshua, we are so sorry.</font>

381
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't apologize.</font>

382
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fault.</font>

383
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess that's what I get for
trusting some black guy.</font>

384
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

385
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you found the trampoline,</font>

386
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the only way to protect
it was to let you use it.</font>

387
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess it goes to prove
what I already knew:</font>

388
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:07,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Non-whites ruin everything.</font>

389
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

390
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joshua was racist.</font>

391
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">That came out of nowhere.</font>

392
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:18,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it?</font>

393
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">A place free from darkness.</font>

394
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">And some are just natural jumpers.</font>

395
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be a maze.</font>

396
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:32,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I just didn't
want to believe it.</font>

397
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that's the lesson here.</font>

398
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Purity that demands exclusion...</font>

399
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't real purity.</font>

400
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe paradise is a lie.</font>

401
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.</font>

402
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paradise exists.</font>

403
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here.</font>

404
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">For once... he's actually right.</font>

405
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me buy you some ice cream.</font>

406
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">My white guilt is
doing somersaults.</font>

407
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worth it.</font>

408
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh, paradise.</font>

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Horse-neck.</font>

410
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... What's with the clothes?</font>

411
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you look like a toddler
who got dressed in the dark.</font>

412
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww, snap!</font>

413
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it comes, y'all!</font>

414
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at your face.</font>

415
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:30,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like your mom was a lizard
who got raped by a muppet.</font>

416
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that burn was brought
to you by the letter "s,"</font>

417
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">as in snap!</font>

418
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:36,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

419
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:38,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too hurt to respond?</font>

420
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhh! That's right.</font>

421
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have feelings.</font>

422
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the rest of us feel
ashamed of ourselves,</font>

423
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we act like bitches to
make ourselves feel better.</font>

424
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you did it to fit in.</font>

425
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no matter how hard you try,</font>

426
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:53,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">you never will.</font>

427
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snap. Snap!</font>

428
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!</font>

429
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up! Ooh! Ooh! Snap! Snap!</font>

430
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Snap! Snap!</font>

431
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snap, snap, snap! Woof! Woof!</font>

432
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are you okay?</font>

433
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was so cruel.</font>

434
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:16,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserved it.</font>

435
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have never been mean to
anybody, least of all you guys.</font>

436
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying so hard to fit
in that I took it too far.</font>

437
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:22,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took it too far.</font>

438
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">We became the kind of
women that we hate,</font>

439
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we turned you into a monster.</font>

440
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind of monster that
makes outlandish statements</font>

441
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">about someone's weight.</font>

442
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those kind of things hurt.</font>

443
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even when they're not true.</font>

444
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all because
we were insecure.</font>

445
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:35,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone is.</font>

446
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Tom Cruise knows
he's short and nuts.</font>

447
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're at the mercy of
each other and ourselves.</font>

448
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there has to be
forgiveness on both sides.</font>

449
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aww...
- Abed...</font>

450
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my goodness.
What happened to Pierce?</font>

451
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:47,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long story.</font>

452
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men.</font>

453
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

454
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Pierce,
will you knock it off?</font>

455
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you,
I'm not controlling it.</font>

456
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a little man inside.</font>

457
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Pierce!</font>

458
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I wanted to
let you know, Pierce,</font>

459
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:09,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's okay to exceed the
recommended daily dosage.</font>

460
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't let anybody
tell you different!</font>

461
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's going to be in charge of
making sure he doesn't O.D.?</font>

462
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What... When did
we start doing that?</font>

463
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:28,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three, two, one... Troy and Abed in the mornin'.</font>

464
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're back with Greendale's
resident animal expert, Star-Burns.</font>

465
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name's Alex.</font>

466
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Star-burns joins us with
his pet turtle, Shelly.</font>

467
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I understand Shelly can
eat over five mice a day.</font>

468
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's impressive.
- Turtles don't eat mice.</font>

469
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do they eat?
- I don't know.</font>

470
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:45,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pellets? I have no idea.</font>

471
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's disappointing.
- That's not good.</font>

472
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, what is going on here?</font>

473
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was studying for
my econ midterm.</font>

474
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys walk in,
you hand me this turtle,</font>

475
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:54,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then you tell me to
smile for the folks at home.</font>

476
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">What folks at home?</font>

477
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ohh.
- Star-burn...</font>

478
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">These things give you
salmonella, you know.</font>

479
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go to Gary with
a check on the weather.</font>

480
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'ts still sunny</font>
