00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:06,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wanted to get
the baby a doll</font>

4
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:10,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">and since the father
might be Andre or Chang,</font>

5
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted all
ethnic bases covered.</font>

6
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:16,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's a little
African-American girl.</font>

7
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's a very nice letter
from the manufacturer</font>

8
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">promising to expand
their selection.</font>

12
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,954

showers can be race neutral.</font>

13
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, thank you, Annie,
for trying to be inclusive,</font>

14
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, um, regardless
of any biological happenstance,</font>

15
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:41,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">this baby will be raised
by Andre and I.</font>

16
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:44,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.
And I seem to recall a story</font>

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a man named Joseph</font>

18
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">who happily raised a baby
that wasn't his.</font>

19
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:50,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">History's greatest chump.</font>

20
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:52,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking
about Joe Kennedy, right?</font>

21
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool. If it's mine,
I'll be a lovable uncle.</font>

22
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:58,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, a creepy uncle.
Final offer.</font>

a sawed-off shotgun,</font>

28
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:09,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">but those are pretty
expensive already.</font>

29
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:11,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
You people eat this stuff?</font>

30
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen
that stuff in my life.</font>

31
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you really
shouldn't say "you people."</font>

32
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,983

54
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're not allowed
to bone him.</font>

55
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,918

she'll bone him.</font>

Let's have a look here.</font>

117

as far as I can go.</font>

120
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I don't want
you to read it, Jeff.</font>

121
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to help me

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.
Better safe than sorry.</font>

127
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you need me
to make Chang</font>

128
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">sign away
his hypothetical baby?</font>

in the business</font>

139
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">of knowing what's going on
in Chang's head, huh?</font>

140
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

141
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
For the child.</font>

Oh, I'm so sorry,</font>

144

not tell Troy and Abed</font>

They're just really worried</font>

you know, see each other</font>

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry.</font>

151
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can keep a secret.</font>

152
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm from the Balkans.</font>

153
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are many things
I try not to talk about.</font>

154
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:55,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lukka...</font>

155
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it.</font>

156
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew there was pain in there.</font>

157
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:00,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know,</font>

158
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can talk to me
about anything.</font>

159
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:07,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much killing...</font>

160
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:10,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">The corpses
stacked like firewood,</font>

161
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rivers red
with their blood...</font>

162
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:14,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss it so much.</font>

163
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lukka.</font>

164
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Wait, just, um...
Just to clarify,</font>

165
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you say you miss it,</font>

166
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like... like you have
survivor's guilt,</font>

167
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you wish you were
back over there</font>

168
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">defending
the motherland, right?</font>

169
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I-I miss cleansing
our fields and forests</font>

170
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the unclean people
who stole my country.</font>

171
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:35,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss the smell
of the villages burning.</font>

172
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss the way they used to run
from our tanks in fear.</font>

173
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, damn it.</font>

174
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">My neighbor is jazz musician.</font>

175
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:48,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Spencer, come on, man.</font>

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got woman in here!</font>

177
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:52,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

178
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">He really knows
how to kill the mood.</font>

179
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Did you look for a job today?</font>

180
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:03,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to,</font>

181
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I noticed
your coffee table's wobbly,</font>

182
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I decided to fix it.</font>

183
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

184
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be the floor.</font>

185
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't saw the floor.
Don't saw anything.</font>

186
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:18,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm tired of confiscating saws.
Give me that.</font>

187
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:22,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this.</font>

188
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:24,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Parental rights"?</font>

189
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:27,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're adopting me?
- It's from Shirley.</font>

190
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">It gives her
and Andre the baby.</font>

191
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sign it.</font>

192
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and if anyone asks,</font>

193
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:35,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">this was my most convincing
speech ever.</font>

194
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you crying?</font>

195
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

196
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me you actually
wanted to be a father.</font>

197
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:50,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

198
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

199
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:55,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what if this
is my last chance?</font>

200
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, between you and me,
I don't Chang a lot of chicks.</font>

201
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:01,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">But fathers are responsible.
They have jobs.</font>

202
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, you crash
on people's couches</font>

203
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">and twitch in your sleep
like a dog dreaming of a rabbit.</font>

204
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real!
You don't...</font>

205
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

206
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're saying if I get a job
and my own apartment,</font>

207
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:19,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley might let me be part
of my baby's life?</font>

208
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:22,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

209
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly what I'm saying.</font>

210
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:29,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So does that mean I can...?
- Go for it.</font>

211
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you keep
getting these?</font>

212
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, where are you going?</font>

213
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're grabbing lunch</font>

214
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a marathon video game
session with Lukka.</font>

215
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of fork foods... don't want
to grease up the troops.</font>

216
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, speaking of Lukka,</font>

217
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much do you guys know
about him, anyway?</font>

218
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:52,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Did you start dating him,</font>

219
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now you want to tell us
horrible things about him?</font>

220
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:55,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No.</font>

221
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, 'cause Lukka's gonna
teach us how to break the will</font>

222
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">of an entire village
by killing their livestock</font>

223
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">and desecrating
their places of worship.</font>

224
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds horrific.</font>

225
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Girls are
so un-desensitized.</font>

226
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey.</font>

227
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:13,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.</font>

228
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that little talk go</font>

229
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Chang last night?</font>

230
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, about that, Shirley,</font>

231
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave my most
convincing speech ever,</font>

232
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:19,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and it didn't take.
- Didn't take?</font>

233
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not giving him
a perm, Jeff.</font>

234
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need to him
to sign a contract.</font>

235
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, "need" is...
Is a strong word.</font>

236
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Shirley would feel
more comfortable</font>

237
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we had something in writing.</font>

238
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">However,
I believe that we can handle</font>

239
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever obstacle
comes our way.</font>

240
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, baby.</font>

241
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good,
good morning, everybody.</font>

242
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see
the stock market today?</font>

243
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up, down...
Pick a direction, huh?</font>

244
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:43,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I don't know
about you guys,</font>

245
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've been circling
these want ads all morning.</font>

246
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who wants to take a break
and build a birdhouse?</font>

247
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, what's going on?</font>

248
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just getting
my act together.</font>

249
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a baby coming.</font>

250
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:55,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can almost hear
the pitter-patter</font>

251
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:57,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">of little Chinese feet
across the treetops.</font>

252
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when that happens,</font>

253
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to be
the best dad I can be.</font>

254
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, Jeff, huh?</font>

255
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
don't leave me hanging,</font>

256
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">my main mentor.</font>

257
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey,
is that a reason to leave?</font>

258
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey? Excuse me.</font>

259
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

260
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:14,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you a question,
dad-to-dad.</font>

261
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I have to put
the vcr on three</font>

262
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Bones is on five?</font>

263
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:20,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

264
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:23,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff! Jeffrey!</font>

265
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:26,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you not gonna make
a pregnant woman run.</font>

266
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you not gonna make
a pregnant woman</font>

267
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:35,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">walk this distance between us.</font>

268
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I ask you to help me,</font>

269
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you take that
as an opportunity</font>

270
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get Chang
out of your apartment?</font>

271
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, who am I to stand
in the way</font>

272
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">of someone trying
to put their life together?</font>

273
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What am I, daytime television?
- Very cute, Jeff.</font>

274
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how cute is it gonna be</font>

275
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">when that lunatic
is dangling my baby</font>

276
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">over a lion cage
on alternate weekends?</font>

277
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be pretty cute.
Are they baby lions?</font>

278
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">New low, Jeff, even for you.</font>

279
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:57,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley...</font>

280
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. I'm not gonna make
a pregnant woman storm off?</font>

281
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at them run.</font>

282
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:05,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">They must die like
the maggots that they are.</font>

283
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:07,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, Lukka, I didn't know
we got extra points</font>

284
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">- for killing villagers.
- He's amazing.</font>

285
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought I knew everything
about this game.</font>

286
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

287
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Lukka.</font>

288
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- Unbelievable.</font>

289
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, calm down.
I'm just here</font>

290
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:20,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my "trekkies do it
in the final frontier" hat.</font>

291
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:21,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my hat.</font>

292
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:22,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

293
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:23,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure?
- Yep.</font>

294
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Lukka, you are
really good at this game,</font>

295
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:35,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there must be a reason that
you are so good at this game.</font>

296
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, though your flirtation
technique is hilarious,</font>

297
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:39,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's distracting.</font>

298
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lukka is kicking
serious ass right now.</font>

to a farmers market.</font>

300
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bang, bang, you're dead!</font>

301
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:48,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save your tears
for your dog mother in hell!</font>

302
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine.</font>

303
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:54,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

304
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have DVD blu-ray disc</font>

305
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:59,597
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kick Puncher 3 : "The Final Kickening."</i></font>

306
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let me borrow, no?</font>

307
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, no can do, Lukka.
Sorry.</font>

308
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to guys like Pierce</font>

309
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:04,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">who kept writing "this side up"
on all my disks,</font>

310
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a strict
no-lending policy on my DVDs.</font>

311
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would happen
if somebody broke that rule?</font>

312
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd be dead to me forever.</font>

313
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we watch <i> Kick Puncher 3
"The Final Kickening"</i></font>

314
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">together sometime.</font>

315
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Lukka, maybe we do.</font>

316
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">May... be...</font>

317
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:22,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">we... do.</font>

318
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please leave?</font>

319
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:27,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to play anymore.</font>

320
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I feel sick.
- She's strange.</font>

321
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Chang, can I talk
to you for a second?</font>

322
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, can't talk
till I see my face in this.</font>

323
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:40,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can I give you
some advice...</font>

324
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:41,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad-to-dad?</font>

325
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:42,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.</font>

326
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:44,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pipe. Okay.</font>

327
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's on your mind, neighbor?</font>

328
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's great
that you're trying to get</font>

329
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">your life together, right?</font>

330
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for your sake
and for Shirley's,</font>

331
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you just need
to relax a little.</font>

332
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see what's going on.</font>

333
00:12:58,308 --> 00:12:59,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're scared.</font>

334
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel me coming up
on your tail, huh?</font>

335
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No... no, no.</font>

336
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, listen, I've been a father
for 11 years,</font>

337
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a good one for 9 of those.</font>

338
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:08,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm there
when they're sick.</font>

339
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pick 'em up from school,
help 'em with their homework.</font>

340
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, Chang,
it's not how you act,</font>

341
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's what you do.</font>

342
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:16,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

343
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:20,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that pool table
put aluminum siding on itself?</font>

344
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:21,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

345
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:24,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, see, that's not
what I'm talking about.</font>

346
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:30,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go ahead
and consider that point missed.</font>

347
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your text.
What's going on?</font>

348
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something terrible
has happened.</font>

349
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">My <i>Kick Puncher 3: "The Final Kickening"</i> DVD</font>

350
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">is missing.</font>

351
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's awful.</font>

352
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody took it?
Who would...</font>

353
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
"Kickmuncher 3"?</font>

354
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't that the movie
that Lukka was...?</font>

355
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think...?</font>

356
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless...</font>

357
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't suppose...?
However...</font>

358
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

359
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would mean that you guys</font>

360
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">would have to stop
hanging out... no!</font>

361
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have video of you
taking the DVD, Britta.</font>

362
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

363
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a security camera
in your room?</font>

364
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for an extremely
thorough documentary</font>

365
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm making on my life.</font>

366
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mostly footage
of me watching dailies,</font>

367
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">but every once in a while
it comes in handy.</font>

368
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand
why you would do this</font>

369
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then
try to pin it on Lukka.</font>

370
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're just ruining
cool guys for fun.</font>

371
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just cruelty, Britta.</font>

372
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:27,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're inhuman.
You're an inhuman person.</font>

373
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:28,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a monster.</font>

374
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lukka's a monster for realsies.</font>

375
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did this so you guys
would stop hanging out with him.</font>

376
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:32,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a war criminal!</font>

377
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're embarrassing
yourself, Britta.</font>

378
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">In what war is he a criminal...</font>

379
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle for our affections?</font>

380
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, how about the genocide
in the Balkans?</font>

381
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, yeah, you would say that.</font>

382
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just got caught
red-handed borrowing a DVD</font>

383
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">without permission.</font>

384
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys have to believe me.</font>

385
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:54,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's so much worse
than tall Kyle!</font>

386
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jefe.</font>

387
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hola.
- Hola</font>

388
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
Who are these tiny people?</font>

389
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I picked up Shirley's kids
from school,</font>

390
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm helping them
with their Spanish homework.</font>

391
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, kids.
- Ooh!</font>

392
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.
Watch the cardigan.</font>

393
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why?</font>

394
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">To prove I'm a responsible dad.</font>

395
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">This proves you're a kidnapper.</font>

396
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell's wrong with you?
- I am nuts, Jeff!</font>

397
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:24,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get with the program!</font>

398
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:25,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
What have I done?</font>

399
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I actually said
you could be a father.</font>

400
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can be.
- Oh, no, you can't.</font>

401
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be anything,
and you never will.</font>

402
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:33,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pretended
to have faith in you</font>

403
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get you off my couch
and out of my apartment.</font>

404
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, call Shirley
and beg forgiveness.</font>

405
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kids, why don't you get
your stuff together?</font>

406
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take you home.</font>

407
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:46,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Shirley?</font>

408
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley's your mom, dumb-ass.</font>

409
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our mom's name is Loquanda.</font>

410
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, that's racist.</font>

411
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Is your mom's name
really Loquanda?</font>

412
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You said you were
a friend of hers.</font>

413
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:58,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you know that,
dumb-ass?</font>

414
00:15:58,755 --> 00:15:59,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do! I...</font>

415
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just playing
a educational game with you!</font>

416
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Don't give me that lip.</font>

417
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, kids, you mind waiting
in the hallway?</font>

418
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, no problem.
- Go ahead.</font>

419
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to understand
something while I'm gone.</font>

420
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a horrible human being,</font>

421
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will never feel sorry
for you again.</font>

422
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:16,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care
what happens to you,</font>

423
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when I get back,
I want you gone.</font>

424
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:20,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, believe me,</font>

425
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will definitely be far,
far away from here.</font>

426
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, policeman,
how much do you pay</font>

427
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:32,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">for anonymous tips
about kidnappings?</font>

428
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, fine. This one's on me</font>

429
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're free to go.</font>

430
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's your wallet, keys,
and pasties.</font>

431
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're nipple guards
for running.</font>

432
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Olympic athletes use them.</font>

433
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:51,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy, I worked
at a maximum-security prison</font>

434
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">for seven years,</font>

435
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those are still
the gayest thing I've ever seen.</font>

436
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I find that
hard to believe.</font>

437
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey, I spoke
to the boys' mother.</font>

438
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not gonna press charges.
Are you okay?</font>

439
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm fine.</font>

440
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent the night
learning arts and crafts</font>

441
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">from my cell mate, Chabo.</font>

442
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know
you can make an ashtray</font>

443
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:09,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">using only a cigarette
and a snitch's forehead?</font>

444
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:10,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

445
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:14,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, uh, Shirley, I'm...</font>

446
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I tried to capitalize</font>

447
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">on your situation with Chang.</font>

448
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:19,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apology accepted.</font>

449
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punishment is time served.</font>

450
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no cell on earth
that can hold Chang!</font>

451
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this place's secrets.</font>

452
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger!
Thank God you're all right!</font>

453
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been looking all...
Hey, Tracy. What's up, baby?</font>

454
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they arresting Chang?</font>

455
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:35,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said Loquanda
wasn't pressing charges.</font>

456
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm, not against Jeff,</font>

457
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I talked her
into going after Chang</font>

458
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">for child endangerment.</font>

459
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:40,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, he could get
three to five years for that.</font>

460
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure
that's what you want?</font>

461
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if we put
our heads together,</font>

462
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">we could be rid of him
for 20 to life.</font>

463
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Oh, absolutely.</font>

464
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I'd have to do is testify</font>

465
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he tried
to sell those kids to me</font>

466
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">and throw in the fact that
he was teaching them Spanish,</font>

467
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">and any d.A. Worth his salt</font>

468
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:56,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">can make a case
for human trafficking.</font>

469
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:58,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like how you thinking.</font>

470
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong with you two?</font>

471
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:01,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing this
to Chang?</font>

472
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andre, I'm doing this for us.</font>

473
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a second chance
for our family,</font>

474
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just want
everything to be perfect.</font>

475
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:09,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, that's what you wanted
the first time around.</font>

476
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did everything in your power
to make everything perfect,</font>

477
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:12,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">and look what happened.</font>

478
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:13,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying
to tell me you cheated</font>

479
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I wanted what was best
for our family?</font>

480
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I cheated
because I was a coward.</font>

481
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you took me back,
because while I was gone,</font>

482
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">somehow you learned to accept
the bad with the good.</font>

483
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's
the Greendale effect.</font>

484
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our school motto
is "lower your standards."</font>

485
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, look,
I know you are ashamed</font>

486
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what happened with Chang.</font>

487
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, I am too, all right?</font>

488
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">But locking that little man up</font>

489
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not gonna make our lives
any less crazy.</font>

490
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll only make prison crazier.</font>

491
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you're right.</font>

492
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:44,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's impossible to keep
the chaos from your lives.</font>

493
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we learned that
in that movie</font>

494
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">we saw
with all those dinosaurs.</font>

495
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jurassic Park?
- No, it's complicated.</font>

496
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, time-out.</font>

497
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

498
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to you, you,
officer baby.</font>

499
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:01,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go buddy, come on!</font>

500
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:04,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! No! No!
- Come on, you're coming with me</font>

501
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:14,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?</font>

502
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You guys want me
to ruin something for you?</font>

503
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you're being dramatic.</font>

504
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:24,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">We asked Lukka a few questions
after what you said.</font>

505
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told us
about his time in the army</font>

506
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:27,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and...</font>

507
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:29,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">The things he did.</font>

508
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm never gonna get some
of those images out of my head.</font>

509
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:32,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I ever go to the Balkans,</font>

510
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:34,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bringing some serious
cheat codes and walk-throughs.</font>

511
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell us sooner?</font>

512
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:37,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I didn't want
to be the one</font>

513
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:39,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">to ruin another guy
for you guys.</font>

514
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, there's a difference
between telling us</font>

515
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:42,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">a guy likes nipple play</font>

516
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:46,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">and telling us a guy
makes hats out of babies.</font>

517
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the reason
this happened</font>

518
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:50,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">is because we've been riding you
kind of hard lately.</font>

519
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about from now on,
we promise to go easier on you,</font>

520
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you promise not to tell us</font>

521
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">any details
about the guys you're dating,</font>

522
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless they've committed genocide.</font>

523
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or if they're left-handed.</font>

524
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:01,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know about that.
I'm making a chart.</font>

525
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal.</font>

526
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I ruined game night.</font>

527
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tend to ruin stuff.</font>

528
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- You do not.</font>

529
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to watch
catfish with us?</font>

530
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that the movie where the
guy flirts with the girl online,</font>

531
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:18,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then it turns out
that it's a fat, old woman?</font>

532
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Sorry.</font>

533
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:22,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cool.</font>

534
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's about catfish.</font>

535
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:04,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this was fun.</font>
