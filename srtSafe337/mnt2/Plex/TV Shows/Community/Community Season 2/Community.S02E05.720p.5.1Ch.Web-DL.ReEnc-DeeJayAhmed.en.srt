91
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, being raised by TV and movies,</font>

92
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always thought that
Jesus just walked on water</font>

93
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">and told people not to have abortions,</font>

94
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's so much cooler than that.</font>

95
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was like ET, Edward Scissorhands,

99
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs to be cool and addictive,</font>

100
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:47,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">like that video of the
kitten falling asleep.</font>

101
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:48,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

102
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:49,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the story's been told to death,</font>

103
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:50,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I want to approach it in a new way.</font>

104
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:53,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a Jesus movie for
the post post-modern world.</font>

105
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:57,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Jesus as a rapper?</font>

106
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:57,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

107
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to tell the story of Jesus</font>

108
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the perspective of a filmmaker
exploring the life of Jesus.</font>

109
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds very
appealing to filmmakers.</font>

110
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, in the filmmaker's film,
Jesus is a filmmaker</font>

111
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to find God with his camera.</font>

112
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then the filmmaker realizes
that he's actually Jesus</font>

113
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's being filmed by God's camera.</font>

114
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it goes like that
forever in both directions,</font>

115
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a mirror in a mirror,</font>

116
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">because all of the filmmakers are Jesus,</font>

117
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:19,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all their cameras are God,
and the movie is called ABED:</font>

118
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">All caps.</font>

119
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filmmaking beyond film.
A metafilm.</font>

120
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:26,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">My masterpiece.</font>

121
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I don't like it.
- Well, that's okay.</font>

122
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you're reacting the
way the world did to Jesus.</font>

123
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm reacting the way the world does</font>

124
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">to movies about making
movies about making movies.</font>

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, come on, Charlie Kaufman,</font>

126
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">some of us have work
in the morning, damn.</font>

127
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does this mean you don't
want to work on the movie?</font>

128
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This means there is no movie.</font>

129
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the movie.</font>

130
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game is Jacks and deuces wild.</font>

131
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except if the dean comes
in, and then it's bingo.</font>

132
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:04,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it. I've got another one.</font>

133
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:09,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get caught with that,
just say it's your 90th birthday.</font>

134
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, it's adorable.</font>

135
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:13,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

136
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, now. What is this again?</font>

137
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">B-19.</font>

138
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. B-19, my butt.</font>

139
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,887

140
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:24,807

00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and deal. Let's go.</font>

153
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:02,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, did you really die
for our sins? That's dopey.</font>

154
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, dope.</font>

155
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:07,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, freudian slip, perhaps
due to my feeling kind of dopey.</font>

156
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the line, atheist.</font>

157
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, did you really die for our sins?</font>

158
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:12,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's dope.</font>

159
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's dope?</font>

160
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:18,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check out these... beatitudes.</font>

161
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,</font>

162
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">the kingdom of heaven is open
all week, Jesus and me were...</font>

163
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

164
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have arrived!</font>

165
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:36,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am watched, as I am watching.</font>

166
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am audience and creation.</font>

167
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The earth shall know my power!</font>

168
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, what are you doing?</font>

169
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great! You blew the take!</font>

170
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, keep rolling.</font>

171
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:53,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can all be part of it.</font>

172
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:56,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no takes.</font>

173
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no viewer.</font>

174
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">The film is the story.</font>

175
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">The story is us.</font>

176
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the film.</font>

177
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:05,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's totally meta.</font>

178
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's get back to our
non-meta production, shall we?</font>

179
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:10,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- No, I want to watch this.</font>

180
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, there's no time.</font>

181
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, we quit. Right, Britta?</font>

182
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:18,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even believe in God,
but I love me some Abed.</font>

183
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

184
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.</font>

185
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:38,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The story of the story is the story."</font>

186
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, that'll play in poughkeepsie.</font>

187
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard some theaters are
gonna show it in reverse.</font>

188
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard it's the same movie
backward and forward.</font>

189
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:48,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard the deleted
scenes are the scenes</font>

190
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the scenes are the deleted scenes.</font>

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard Jesus died for our sins.</font>

192
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, guys,</font>

193
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">the director's answering
questions in the cafeteria,</font>

194
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it both is and
isn't part of the movie!</font>

195
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah!
- Get a table!</font>

196
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are we all in the movie right now?</font>

197
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all in a movie, even
when there are no cameras.</font>

198
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will the movie be released?</font>

199
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:16,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">When is life released?</font>

200
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every minute of our
lives is a world premiere,</font>

201
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my father has already
bought the popcorn.</font>

202
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

203
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, Abed, but you
aren't actually trying to say</font>

204
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're Jesus, are you?</font>

205
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am who you say I am.</font>

206
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

207
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:38,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, ooh, it's meta now.</font>

208
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except here's the thing.</font>

209
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a devout Christian, and you guys</font>

210
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">are feeding into this
poor boy's delusions.</font>

211
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:48,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">So cool! She's an actual
real life pharisee!</font>

212
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, bitch, why don't you
go back to your temple?</font>

213
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:51,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

214
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:55,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you all stop confusing Jesus</font>

215
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an egotistical filmmaking lunatic?</font>

216
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgive her.</font>

217
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how's your film going, Abed?</font>

218
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blasphemously.</font>

219
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not blasphemy to say
that we are God, Shirley.</font>

220
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">First Corinthians:</font>

Lord is one with him in spirit."</font>

00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just scripture me, Muslim?</font>

223
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:35,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus was Jewish.</font>

224
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ever gonna let that go?</font>

225
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. No religious talk.</font>

226
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's late.</font>

227
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that in your pocket?</font>

228
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, Britta, Pierce is smoking cigars.</font>

229
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it to you, butt-breath?</font>

230
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:52,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at your eyes.</font>

231
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been out all
night with those hipsters?</font>

232
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:55,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hipsters?</font>

233
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">That pack of old people that
hang out in the cafeteria.</font>

234
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">People call them hipsters 'cause
they all have hip replacements.</font>

235
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do not.</font>

236
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard could probably kick your ass.</font>

237
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard?</font>

238
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're hanging out with Leonard?</font>

239
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I hate him.</font>

240
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">So? Everybody hates him.</font>

241
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why he's cool.</font>

242
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:14,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You people don't get it.</font>

243
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Pierce, I'm not sure
that I want to get it,</font>

244
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think you ought to take a break</font>

245
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">from these new friends of yours.</font>

246
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got you all riled up.</font>

247
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Leonard said you'd say.</font>

248
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:24,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Leonard is not a
part of this study group,</font>

249
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you apologize right now to...</font>

250
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:28,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">what? Ah!</font>

251
00:11:28,628 --> 00:11:29,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your father!</font>

252
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:31,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said you were!</font>

253
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:33,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you going?
- Out!</font>

254
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did Pierce become awesome?</font>

255
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am gonna shut you down, you know that?</font>

256
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do.
- Oh! Oh, I get it!</font>

257
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to shut you down.</font>

258
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I'm not gonna do it.
- Don't.</font>

259
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I won't.
- Good.</font>

260
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am gonna shut you down.</font>

261
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

262
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have seen his face.</font>

263
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was terrified.</font>

264
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:58,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're his worst nightmare now.</font>

265
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're old and you don't give a damn.</font>

266
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Booyah!</font>

267
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:10,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make eye contact,
and we'll be fine.</font>

268
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm, here comes the boss!</font>

269
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:18,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The dean has got a date.
- What a lovely couple.</font>

270
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, give us a break, will you?</font>

271
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh!</font>

272
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to see you hipsters
when I come back out here!</font>

273
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Run, run. We made them angry.</font>

274
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:30,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've made them angry.
- Hey, he left his keys.</font>

275
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, who's up for a joyride?</font>

276
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hell yeah.
- Oh, I don't know.</font>

277
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could get into some
serious trouble here.</font>

278
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:37,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

279
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:40,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get caught, we can just
pretend we're disoriented,</font>

280
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:42,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he can give us a ride home.</font>

281
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:46,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I? What year is it?</font>

282
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we've all been drinking.</font>

283
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, grow a schmekel.</font>

284
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:55,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everyone, this is the last scene.</font>

285
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:58,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to thank you all for
contributing in your small way</font>

286
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the greatest film ever made.</font>

287
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on the seventh day,
Shirley shut down production.</font>

288
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, Shirley has informed me</font>

289
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:06,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you are using school equipment</font>

290
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">on school property to
make a religious film.</font>

291
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has filed an official complaint,</font>

292
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">invoking the separation
of church and state.</font>

293
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:16,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pointed out the irony to her already.</font>

294
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't give a crap.
Let's be ironic.</font>

295
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:18,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut it down.</font>

296
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, are you making a religious film?</font>

297
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">All movies are religious to me.</font>

298
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:27,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. But is it a movie about Jesus?</font>

299
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the Matrix? Is Robocop?</font>

300
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Superman Returns?</font>

301
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">All stories are about
death and resurrection.</font>

302
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:36,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got one. Wrath of Khan, hmm?</font>

303
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:37,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good one.</font>

304
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spock sacrifices himself
for the crew and gets reborn.</font>

305
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">How captivating was
Ricardo Montalban in that?</font>

306
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except in Abed's film, the
character's name isn't Spock!</font>

307
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:49,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true. It's Abed.</font>

308
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I'm getting creative
goose bumps here.</font>

309
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love Charlie Kaufman.</font>

310
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to run into
editing for one second,</font>

311
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you want, we can grab you a chair</font>

312
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you can watch a take.</font>

313
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would love that.</font>

314
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never watched a take before.</font>

315
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:05,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is exciting.
- Uh, you...</font>

316
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:10,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what you will about Abed,
but the man cannot be killed.</font>

317
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's almost like he's Jesus.</font>

318
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it.</font>

319
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we should be driving.</font>

320
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:20,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, we're all, you
know, old and groggy.</font>

321
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, stop worrying.</font>

322
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Richard flew zeroes during the big one.</font>

323
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, "flew zeroes"?</font>

324
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:28,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not Japanese.</font>

325
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what did you fly
during the big one, rich?</font>

326
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

327
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on. Stop farting around.</font>

328
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, I don't know where I am.</font>

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">What year is it?</font>

330
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I drive?</font>

331
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's bail.</font>

332
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. What about Richard?</font>

333
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw Richard!
It's every man for himself!</font>

334
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:13,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Richard, are you all right?</font>

335
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:17,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, am I Richard?</font>

336
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:18,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

337
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'm fine.</font>

338
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:22,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who were those people that ran away?</font>

339
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our friends?</font>

340
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:25,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good question.</font>

341
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

342
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

343
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no takes.
There is no viewer.</font>

344
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:40,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">The film is the story.
The story is us.</font>

345
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the film.</font>

346
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you think?</font>

347
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to take a walk.</font>

348
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God, my movie is
the worst piece of crap</font>

349
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have ever seen in my entire life.</font>

350
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could I have been so blind?</font>

351
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a self-indulgent, adolescent mess.</font>

352
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can barely sit through it.</font>

353
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:17,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, with all this hype,</font>

354
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a real snakes
on a plane brewing.</font>

355
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">The critics are gonna crucify me.</font>

356
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">My career will be over before it begins.</font>

357
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, if you're out there,
I know I don't deserve it,</font>

358
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I need your help.</font>

359
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please take this project away from me.</font>

360
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it rain, send a meteor,</font>

361
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything. Please?</font>

362
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now?</font>

363
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I get it. This is what I deserve.</font>

364
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll finish it up.</font>

365
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:51,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Pierce Hawthorne's
emergency contact.</font>

366
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:53,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're here to pick him up?
- No, no.</font>

367
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to be removed
as his emergency contact.</font>

368
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:59,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One second.
- Hey, I got a class!</font>

369
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everybody?</font>

370
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:02,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anyone coming to get Leonard?</font>

371
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:06,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Nobody comes for him anymore.</font>

372
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">His kids asked us to stop calling them.</font>

373
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:11,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think he acts like that?</font>

374
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're in prison, right?</font>

375
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, bring him out.</font>

376
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:25,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here, Pierce.
Come on. Book.</font>

377
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

378
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go wait in the car.</font>

379
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:30,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't my fault.</font>

380
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Wait. In. The. Car.</font>

381
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh!</font>

382
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to change that or not?</font>

383
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess not.</font>

384
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, but, um, could you do me a favor?</font>

385
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you add Britta Perry as a contact?</font>

386
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">P-e-r-r-y.</font>

387
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">And would you give her a
call a couple of times a week?</font>

388
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">She gets pretty worried about him.</font>

389
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, she works days, so
make sure you call at night.</font>

390
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone thinks what you
did was destined to happen,</font>

391
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it was proof that
God was making my movie,</font>

392
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:20,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">a movie so good, it could never exist.</font>

393
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think I'm a genius,
and they think you're a villain.</font>

394
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard me praying.</font>

395
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you mean.</font>

396
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is gonna be good!</font>

397
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:37,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed sent me a new link, and
that man knows his video virality.</font>

398
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:40,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're just gonna drop all
pretense of actually teaching us?</font>

399
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:42,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Here we go.</font>

400
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,</font>

401
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">the kingdom of heaven is open all week.</font>

402
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You finished my movie.</font>

403
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:52,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you mean.</font>

404
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:58,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">You humble me.</font>

405
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">You humble me too.</font>

406
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, open your books, because
Abed has broken the Internet.</font>

407
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:22,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

408
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:27,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">So which one of us is
gonna head home and change?</font>

409
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hilarious.</font>

410
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you guys bought one of my outfits</font>

411
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then staked out my apartment
every day until I wore it?</font>

412
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not pathetic.</font>

413
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

414
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well.</font>

415
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:43,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job.</font>

416
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm heading home to change now.</font>

417
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I hit traffic.
Did I miss it?</font>
