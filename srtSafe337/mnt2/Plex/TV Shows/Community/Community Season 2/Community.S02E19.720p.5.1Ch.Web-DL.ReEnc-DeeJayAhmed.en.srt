00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:05,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my friend Abed's birthday.</font>

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:06,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had met Abed at community college</font>

3
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:08,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">almost two years earlier.</font>

4
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:09,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">His obsession with pop culture</font>

5
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:11,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">had always alienated him.</font>

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd quote movies, pretend
his life was a TV show.</font>

7
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">He watched Cougar Town.</font>

8
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:17,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was as if he didn't
want people to like him.</font>

9
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then this year, around Christmas,</font>

10
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:21,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had some kind of...</font>

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know... mental episode,</font>

12
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">saying people were made
of clay... stuff like that.</font>

13
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:28,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd seemed okay since,
but when I asked him</font>

14
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he'd like to do
anything for his birthday,</font>

15
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:32,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">he told me we should have
dinner, just he and I,</font>

16
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:35,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an important conversation.</font>

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made me nervous.</font>

18
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:40,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">The restaurant Abed had chosen
wasn't his style at all.</font>

19
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were cloth napkins, no TVs.</font>

20
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed liked chicken fingers, video games,</font>

21
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:46,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quentin Tarantino.</font>

22
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:49,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Babysitting him through a full meal</font>

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">at a restaurant for grown-ups...</font>

24
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wasn't up for it.</font>

25
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I loved Abed. Everyone did.</font>

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I had come there with a
surprise plan of my own.</font>

27
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, could I get a MacAllan, neat?</font>

28
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeffrey!</font>

29
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy.</font>

30
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like your sweater.</font>

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it come with a Golden Retriever?</font>

32
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:18,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look good too.</font>

33
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:23,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like a, uh... spritzer.</font>

34
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed was being weird.</font>

35
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:28,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by that, I mean he wasn't being weird.</font>

36
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:32,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was hugging, smiling,
making eye contact,</font>

37
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:35,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in 30 seconds, he hadn't
made a reference to anything.</font>

38
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had come in worried about him,</font>

39
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinking he needed help.</font>

40
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:42,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">But seeing him like this made
me more worried than ever.</font>

41
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:45,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it? Like Pulp Fiction.</font>

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a wallet that says "Bad mother..."</font>

43
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your table's ready, gentlemen.
- Thank you.</font>

44
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, uh, I had an idea.</font>

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a very cool burger place
just a few...</font>

46
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nonsense.
I didn't come downtown for burgers.</font>

47
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:58,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, come.</font>

48
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I-I'll be right there.</font>

49
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, we're running a little bit late...</font>

50
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">No big deal, just a small speed bump.</font>

51
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hurry up. We're waiting.</font>

52
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:16,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise!</font>

53
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, no! They're running late.</font>

54
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:23,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff says there's some kind of speed bump.</font>

55
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, nobody can hear you.</font>

56
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm hot, and my balls
are touching the zipper!</font>

60
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he walks in?</font>

61
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course we can imagine it.
It's always the same.</font>

62
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but he's gonna say "cool"</font>

63
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">at least five times.</font>

64

66

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm?
- Hmm?</font>

67
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool, someone got him a briefcase,</font>

68
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">like in the movie. What's in it?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't touch that!</font>

70

<font color="#FFFFFF">nobody but Abed can open it.</font>

72
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:27,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What's in it?</font>

73
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:31,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, I have 3D vision now?</font>

- Hmm?</font>

86
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "hmm."</font>

87

<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, is this menu stuffy.</font>

88
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about you, but
I'd rather have a nice...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Rillettes de saumon, to start, I think,</font>

91
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,551

93
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,440

- Yeah, I nailed it.</font>

94
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, you forgot this in the bar.</font>

95
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, so I did. I'm sorry.</font>

96
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a thoughtful gift, Jeff.</font>

97
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really was a man of singular taste.</font>

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was? Abed, what's going on?</font>

99
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you dressed like Mr. Rogers</font>

100
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and talking like Frasier?
What happened to you?</font>

101
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, where to begin.</font>

102
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I probably mentioned in
the past my fondness</font>

103
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a TV program called Cougar Town.</font>

104
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here and there.</font>

105
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I even started a Cougar Town fan club</font>

106
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:41,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">on Facebook.</font>

107
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to accomplish anything, mind you.</font>

108
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simply to express my love for the show.</font>

109
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it ended up being
quite large, this fan club,</font>

110
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh, one morning,</font>

111
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it was maybe early March,</font>

112
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this Facebook message...</font>

113
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">A very nice message from the
people who make Cougar Town.</font>

114
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looking for work?
- No, thanking me, Jeff...</font>

115
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, for all the support
I generated for the show.</font>

116
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the last paragraph, they said,</font>

117
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">"If you'd like, you could
come visit the set,"</font>

118
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">just like that.</font>

119
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, that's cool of them.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

120
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that kind of makes them</font>

121
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Pulp Fictions of people.</font>

122
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, how great was that movie.</font>

123
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So I sold a few
of my action figures,</font>

124
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I bought a round-trip
ticket to Los Angeles.</font>

125
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, you went? When?
- Over spring break.</font>

126
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:21,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">What could I do?
Two days after I got that invitation,</font>

127
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on the set of Cougar Town, Jeff.</font>

128
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:25,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cougar Town.</font>

129
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you want me
to take it seriously,</font>

130
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">stop saying its name.</font>

131
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You laugh, Jeff,</font>

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the people were wonderful,</font>

133
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, not just the actors,</font>

134
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the crew, everyone.</font>

135
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must have been 200 people,</font>

136
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">each with a specific function,</font>

137
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">but all dedicated to a single purpose.</font>

138
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like a village
or like a living thing.</font>

139
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, you know, I'm talking to the director,</font>

140
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he says, "Why don't you
jump into the background?"</font>

141
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:47,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say, "Nah, wait a minute.</font>

142
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jump into the background of what exactly?"</font>

143
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he says, "Jump into the
background of this scene.</font>

144
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:54,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk through it. Walk through Cougar Town."</font>

145
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

146
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:59,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, before I can react, this
girl takes me by the hand,</font>

147
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she stands me behind this patio</font>

148
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:03,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Courtney Cox and the
actors are doing their scene.</font>

149
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the girl says, "Now,
when you hear 'action,'</font>

150
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:07,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to walk from
here to there," right?</font>

151
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I really
started to panic, Jeff,</font>

152
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if I'm a person
that watches Cougar Town,</font>

153
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">how can I be in Cougar Town?</font>

154
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, and the more I
start thinking about it,</font>

155
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:19,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">the less any of it makes any sense at all.</font>

156
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:20,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just want to turn and
run, but it's too late,</font>

157
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:22,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the director's calling "action."</font>

158
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">So before I take my first step,</font>

159
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize that I have to stop being someone</font>

160
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's ever seen the show</font>

161
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:31,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">and become a character on the show.</font>

162
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Become a man from Cougar Town...</font>

163
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:35,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, someone born there,</font>

164
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone whose name, I decide, is Chad.</font>

165
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:40,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I take my first step, as a child might,</font>

166
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">learning to walk as Chad.</font>

167
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with each step, it becomes easier.</font>

168
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with each step, I
start remembering things</font>

169
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Chad's life, like his first kiss</font>

170
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the big tree at Cougar Town field...</font>

171
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing soccer
at Cougar Town Junior High...</font>

172
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finding my first chest hair in the shower,</font>

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">my first apartment,</font>

174
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">my first true love falling
for my best friend,</font>

175
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">birthdays, weddings, car crashes, taxes,</font>

176
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:06,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">playing charades at Thanksgiving.</font>

177
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chad had lived, Jeff.</font>

178
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Chad had lived more than Abed.</font>

179
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:20,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then they called "cut,"
and the scene was over.</font>

180
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wasn't ready to stop being Chad,</font>

181
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I said to the director,
"Can we have one more take?"</font>

182
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:28,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they were already moving on.</font>

183
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:32,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Courtney had nailed it.</font>

184
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lips started trembling,</font>

185
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my... my hands and my feet went numb.</font>

186
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:39,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">My... my knees buckled,</font>

187
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as I fell to the floor...</font>

188
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:46,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pooped my pants.</font>

189
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did...</font>

190
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the truth is,
Jeff, I had been Chad,</font>

191
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Chad was dead.</font>

192
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:58,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as Abed, I was still alive,
so someone helped me up.</font>

193
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the wardrobe lady came over.
She gave me new pants.</font>

194
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:03,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thanked everyone, I apologized,</font>

195
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I just got on a bus and
went straight to the airport.</font>

196
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:13,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, your food's getting cold.</font>

197
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how silly of me.</font>

198
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wondering if Abed's new best friend</font>

199
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:33,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">also got him the best gift?</font>

200
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Abed the best gift.</font>

201
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:40,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd tell you what it is, but
it's an even cooler secret.</font>

202
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:45,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, you promised
that this private party</font>

203
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be done by 8:00.</font>

204
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing this during
the peak business hours</font>

205
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:49,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">for nostalgic-themed diners.</font>

206
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:51,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that true?
Has that been researched?</font>

207
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has, Annie.</font>

208
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">After they get frightened
by the evening news,</font>

209
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">many seek the comforting
foods and soothing music</font>

210
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a pre-racial America.</font>

211
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Im sorry Brian, its just
a litte late.</font>

212
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you all of my
tips from my next shift.</font>

213
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:04,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, your tips.</font>

214
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:08,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">All your tips? Wait, wait, all of them?</font>

215
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:12,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, all the tips the
customers leave for you?</font>

216
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:14,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, is there any way we can
go ahead and spread that out</font>

217
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:17,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">over two years so I don't
get slammed on my taxes?</font>

218
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:19,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my goodness.</font>

219
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

220
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everyone hates Britta.
- Mm.</font>

221
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you know the
real point of that story.</font>

222
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't, but that's okay. Chew.</font>

223
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, I'd been a fool.</font>

224
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, everybody poops their pants.</font>

225
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I was a
fool long before that.</font>

226
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I look back at my life
and I think, "Who was that?</font>

227
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did he care so much about so
many things that didn't matter?"</font>

228
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:45,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, who needs Cougar Town?</font>

229
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who needs any pop culture whatsoever?</font>

230
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">TV, movies... to hell with all of it.</font>

231
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I was, Jeff?
I was that wallet.</font>

232
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the surface, a reference
to some cinematic drivel,</font>

233
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">but on the inside... empty.</font>

234
00:09:56,334 --> 00:10:00,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you love Tarantino.
- No, no, not anymore.</font>

235
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:02,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I wanted to
have this dinner with you.</font>

236
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first birthday of my new life.</font>

237
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:05,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the wallet's cute, Jeff,</font>

238
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'd like to exchange
it for a better gift.</font>

239
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not leaving here until you've given me</font>

240
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">my first real conversation.</font>

241
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay.</font>

242
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you want to have
a real conversation?</font>

243
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:25,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's as real as I get
under the circumstances.</font>

244
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice that you've learned
to dial back your love of TV.</font>

245
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd really like you to
come have a milkshake with me.</font>

246
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">But before you do, I'd like you to remember</font>

247
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much you enjoy Pulp Fiction.</font>

248
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that's as far as I can go
without defeating the purpose.</font>

249
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really tilting the bean can here.</font>

250
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pulp Fiction, milkshakes, bean cans?</font>

251
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to how we talk to each other.</font>

252
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:47,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like robots exchanging
catchphrases and references.</font>

253
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think pointing that out counts</font>

254
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a real conversation?</font>

255
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how many fake people are talking</font>

256
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how fake the world is right now?</font>

257
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:54,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, I'm new at this,</font>

258
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">so can you start our real conversation?</font>

259
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe there's such a thing.</font>

260
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conversation was invented by
humans to conceal reality.</font>

261
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">We use it to sweet-talk our
way around natural selection.</font>

262
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who has real conversations?
Ants.</font>

263
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:10,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">They talk by vomiting chemicals
into each other's mouths.</font>

264
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get right down to brass tacks.</font>

265
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blehh! "Which way's the picnic?"</font>

266
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:15,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blehh! "That way."</font>

267
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Humans are more evolved. We lie.</font>

268
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not all the time.
- That's a lie.</font>

269
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't lie when we're alone.
- Biggest lie ever.</font>

270
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine out of ten lies occur six inches away</font>

271
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the bathroom mirror.</font>

272
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do most of our lying alone.</font>

273
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it even possible
to lie when you're alone?</font>

274
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can call a phone-sex line.</font>

275
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's lying to yourself.
- No, that's just being honest</font>

276
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a stranger about being lonely.</font>

277
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you're dishonest
about why you're lonely?</font>

278
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you're a good-looking
guy who calls a phone-sex line</font>

279
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tells them he weighs 400 pounds,</font>

280
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:43,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so he can hear a woman say
she's attracted to him anyway?</font>

281
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't believe that happens.
- Wrong. That's me.</font>

282
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did that last week.</font>

283
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you pay a woman on the phone</font>

284
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">to think you're fat?</font>

285
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm scared that
if I were overweight</font>

286
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:55,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">that no one would like me.</font>

287
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, that feels good to admit.</font>

288
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, the point being...</font>

289
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point being,</font>

290
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:08,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">you don't have to worry about being normal</font>

291
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">or... or real or whatever this is tonight.</font>

292
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:15,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is a sick place
full of sick, sick people.</font>

293
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:22,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone else?</font>

294
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

295
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got to be so cool,
whatever he got him.</font>

296
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:32,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm saying.
Winger's a man of means.</font>

297
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's with your boy right
now having a fancy dinner.</font>

298
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:41,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby chickens, diamond
forks, brand-name sodas.</font>

299
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he's gonna bring him back here,</font>

300
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">give him whatever's in
there, and that's that.</font>

301
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:48,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy who?</font>

302
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what I think it is?</font>

303
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is.</font>

304
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certificate of authenticity...</font>

305
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must have got it on eBay or something.</font>

306
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff got Abed the actual briefcase</font>

307
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the movie Pulp Fiction!</font>

308
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing?</font>

309
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang made me open it!</font>

310
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">He seduced me with his dark Chinese powers.</font>

311
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:18,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you leave him alone with me?</font>

312
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:20,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I am putting my job on the line</font>

313
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">for this stupid party,</font>

314
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the least you can do is not ruin it.</font>

315
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

316
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I know I'm preaching to the choir,</font>

317
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:41,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you are a bad friend.</font>

318
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you!</font>

319
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said, "No, that's a girl's costume."</font>

320
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:58,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my mom said, "It's fine.</font>

321
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indian boys have long hair and braids too."</font>

322
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was only 45 minutes
left to trick-or-treat,</font>

323
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:04,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">so what could I do?</font>

324
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:09,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put the damn thing on,
and I went door-to-door.</font>

325
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone was going,
"Oh, what a pretty little girl."</font>

326
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by the third house...</font>

327
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped correcting them.</font>

328
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, why draw attention to it?</font>

329
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:24,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, honestly,</font>

330
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:26,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">once the shame and the fear wore off...</font>

331
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:31,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just glad they thought I was pretty.</font>

332
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:37,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, this is incredible...</font>

333
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:41,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, to be able to talk this openly.</font>

334
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:43,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, why can't people be like this?</font>

335
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what's wrong with this world?</font>

336
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

337
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is what you're
doing while we wait.</font>

338
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go home, Pierce.
The party's canceled.</font>

339
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty gay, man. Pretty gay.</font>

340
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Pierce dressed as
the gimp from Pulp Fiction?</font>

341
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:07,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

342
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:10,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wallet, milkshakes...</font>

343
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you set up a surprise
Pulp Fiction birthday party?</font>

344
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, at the greasy fork,
but that doesn't matter now.</font>

345
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:18,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">What matters is this... talking.</font>

346
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It everything okay?</font>

347
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yes. Just the check, please.</font>

348
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry. So you're ending early?</font>

349
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because in my dinner with Andre,</font>

350
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:30,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the waiter brings...
- Check, check, check. Bye.</font>

351
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed?
- Mm-hmm?</font>

352
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my dinner with Andre?</font>

353
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:41,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a movie about, uh, two guys</font>

354
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:43,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking at a restaurant.</font>

355
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this wasn't...</font>

356
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">A real conversation?</font>

357
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were doing another movie?</font>

358
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">A movie about a real conversation.</font>

359
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you poop your pants
on the set of Cougar Town?</font>

360
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">That shouldn't matter.</font>

361
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why we don't hang out!</font>

362
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thanks for getting me fired, jerks.</font>

363
00:16:01,814 --> 00:16:03,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The party's over.
- Cool. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.</font>

364
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:04,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it is.</font>

365
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you guys know where Abed's
really cool present is?</font>

366
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:10,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm returning it.</font>

367
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, it's back at the diner. It's fine.</font>

368
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It probably just needs some detailing.</font>

369
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I really wish you
two got along better.</font>

370
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, no-no juice.</font>

371
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, that's good no-no juice.</font>

372
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:33,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you 1200$</font>

373
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the damages,</font>

374
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you promise to give Britta her job back.</font>

375
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">$800, and she stays fired.</font>

376
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal.</font>

377
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:51,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie told me about the briefcase.</font>

378
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- What a waste.</font>

379
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.</font>

380
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you buy it</font>

381
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:59,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Willy's 100% Authentic
Cinema Treasures on eBay?</font>

382
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yep.
- Yeah, Willy exaggerates.</font>

383
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Indiana Jones' real whip from him.</font>

384
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">He moves about 70 of those a year.</font>

385
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good. I thought I flushed</font>

386
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bunch of money down the toilet.</font>

387
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's great to know that the
real Pulp Fiction briefcase</font>

388
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">is safe somewhere.</font>

389
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mad at me.</font>

390
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent a week planning a party</font>

391
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">just to make you happy.</font>

392
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:18,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I bailed on the
party and ruined it,</font>

393
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">again, just to make you happy.</font>

394
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it turns out, while
I was wasting my time</font>

395
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:23,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to make you happy,</font>

396
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:27,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were making yourself
happy all over everyone else</font>

397
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">by doing yet another stupid movie spoof.</font>

398
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer the term "homage."</font>

399
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:35,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't about making me happy.</font>

400
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I chose my dinner with Andre,
because it's about a guy</font>

401
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:39,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">who has an unexpectedly enjoyable evening</font>

402
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a weird friend he's
been avoiding lately.</font>

403
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I've been avoiding you?</font>

404
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:48,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I hung out more last year.</font>

405
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes sense.</font>

406
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else is growing
and changing all the time,</font>

407
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:54,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's not really my jam.</font>

408
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm more of a fast-blinking,
stoic, removed,</font>

409
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">uncomfortably self-aware type...</font>

410
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:00,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Data...</font>

411
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Johnny-5 or Mork</font>

412
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">or Hal or K.I.T.T. or K-9...</font>

413
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Woodstock and/or Snoopy.</font>

414
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Spock probably
goes without saying...</font>

415
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, I don't need you to grow or change.</font>

416
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:14,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">And take it from someone who
just had a meaningless one,</font>

417
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:16,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes emotional
breakthroughs are overrated.</font>

418
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:20,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, seriously, I need you to keep</font>

419
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:23,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">a tight, heavy lid on the
"Little Indian Girl" story.</font>

420
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure.
- Tight, heavy lid.</font>

421
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. T.H.L.</font>

422
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:31,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still friends?</font>

423
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because nobody paid for
dinner at the restaurant,</font>

424
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I do not have this kind of money.</font>

425
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:47,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went back to pay the bill.</font>

426
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">The restaurant was closed.</font>

427
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise!</font>

428
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:00,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Surprise.
- It was Abed's idea.</font>

429
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group had stayed behind
to salvage the party.</font>

430
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">The waiter had felt bad
for spilling the beans</font>

431
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">about Abed's homage, so he let us stay.</font>

432
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">As parties go, it was quiet, dark,</font>

433
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:24,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a little lame.</font>

434
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd had better parties, and
we'd had worse parties.</font>

435
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:45,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I doubt I'll ever forget</font>

436
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:48,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">my dinner with Andre dinner with Abed.</font>

437
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:01,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks.
- Abed, please...</font>

438
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:03,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Allow me.
- Okay. Thanks.</font>

439
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:09,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.</font>

440
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, that's not good.</font>

441
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said "market price."</font>

442
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">What market are you shopping at?</font>

443
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to run.</font>

444
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me too.
- Okay.</font>

445
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On three.
- One...</font>

446
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:29,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Two...
- Three.</font>
