00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">- just the two of you?
- We're gonna raise money</font>

00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the quad to help with the oil spill.</font>

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're making this display to
show how serious the problem is.</font>

5
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:13,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
Each drop represents</font>

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">10,000 gallons of oil.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh! Oh...</font>

8
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:21,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad this tragedy
overshadowed Haiti.</font>

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have any ideas for that.</font>

10
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, to having fun in pairs!</font>

11
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">What up, party people?</font>

12
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you got a band-aid on your arm.</font>

This is from a blood test.</font>

15
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no... I knew it.</font>

16
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:34,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are going too well for you.</font>

17
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no. Just a physical.</font>

20
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:42,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, just the two of them.</font>

21
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're raising money for the oil spill.</font>

22
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you even know there was one?</font>

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, I have the
aol home page bookmarked.</font>

24
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:48,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you even know about the ostrich,</font>

25
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">that raised the tiger cub?</font>

26
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy, what's wrong?
- I just saw a dead body.</font>

with Pierce now, so...</font>

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">This morning I went to
do laundry in the garage,</font>

31
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I found his mom... dead.</font>

32
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:08,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Troy, that's terrible!</font>

33
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:11,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she had been in
bad shape for a while.</font>

34
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:14,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I guess she crawled out
there to die like a cat.</font>

35
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:18,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been that close
to a dead body before.</font>

36
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:19,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Oh, pumpkin!</font>

37
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:22,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was so cold and gray.</font>

38
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:24,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw her underwear!</font>

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez... who died?</font>

40
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, we're so sorry
to hear about your mom.</font>

41
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:41,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Losing a loved one</font>

42
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">is always difficult.</font>

43
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:45,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? My mom isn't dead.</font>

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when Troy found her,
he said that...</font>

45
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, her heart, lungs,
kidneys, and brain</font>

46
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">stopped working.</font>

47
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">And another way of
saying that would be...</font>

48
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:54,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's used up her organic body.</font>

49
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:57,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">By... dying in it.</font>

50
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:00,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong. She's alive.</font>

51
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom was a part of my Buddhist church.</font>

52
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:06,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a level five
laser lotus, same as me.</font>

53
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a level five's
body stops functioning,</font>

54
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's vaporized in the temple of renewal</font>

55
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:13,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stored in an energon pod.</font>

56
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few years, when
our technology advances,</font>

57
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll extract her body vapors</font>

58
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">and recondense it to a solid state.</font>

59
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">And before you know it,</font>

60
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">mom'll be back in the kitchen
making Troy and me sandwiches.</font>

61
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:25,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha.</font>

62
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pumpkin! It's okay!</font>

from what I've been told,</font>

123
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,494

131
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,803

00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:38,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing I would suggest...</font>

153
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go see a doctor and get a prescription</font>

154
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">for cholesterol medication.</font>

155
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:45,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your cholesterol's a little high.</font>

156
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's no big deal.
Eat some egg whites.</font>

157
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I... I don't understand.</font>

158
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:52,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, did I accidentally
tell you you have AIDS?</font>

159
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:53,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I've done that before.</font>

160
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't... I mean... it doesn't...</font>

161
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I treat my body like a temple!</font>

162
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't be the
first person to tell you</font>

163
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:00,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the temple doesn't last forever.</font>

164
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's made of hamburger.</font>

165
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a... this is a temple of doom.</font>

166
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what?
Like the real Temple of Doom,</font>

167
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">it represents the inconvenient fact</font>

168
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">that all good things...</font>

169
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be they people or movie franchises...</font>

170
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually collapse
into sagging, sloppy,</font>

171
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:18,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">rotten piles of hard to follow nonsense.</font>

172
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:19,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be alone.</font>

173
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... You can do that by leaving.</font>

174
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo. Okay.</font>

175
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:31,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get goin'!</font>

176
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those paps aren't
gonna smear themselves.</font>

177
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no God!</font>

178
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us how you really feel.
Am I right?</font>

179
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:50,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, Jeff.</font>

180
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get the results
of your blood test?</font>

181
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm fine.
- I figured.</font>

182
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:56,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for wising us up yesterday.</font>

183
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were being judgmental
about Pierce's religion.</font>

184
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:00,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the fact is, Jesus...</font>

185
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fact is, everyone's dying.</font>

186
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:04,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we all have these little notions</font>

187
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we're the exception,</font>

188
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:07,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're as wrong as we are dead.</font>

189
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

190
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it going with
the little side project</font>

191
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">that just the two of you are doing?</font>

192
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's great. I made $236,</font>

193
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">plus Britta's makes...</font>

194
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:27,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, all totaled, we're
close to 250, right, Britta?</font>

195
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greendale cares about this issue.</font>

196
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I don't think that's it.</font>

197
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?
- Come on, Annie.</font>

198
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know guys are giving you money</font>

199
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:37,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the whole
sexy schoolgirl routine.</font>

200
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have a routine?
- Yeah.</font>

201
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the one where
you use posture as an excuse</font>

202
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stick out your chest</font>

203
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you laugh at guys' unfunny jokes,</font>

204
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:47,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">pretending not to know</font>

205
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they have a sock at
home with your name on it.</font>

206
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:53,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... That's me,</font>

207
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if a guy wants to
make a puppet of me,</font>

208
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's hardly your concern.</font>

209
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just may be an outsider here</font>

210
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I was never
called to participate,</font>

211
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it seems to me that Britta's upset</font>

212
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she's raising
less money than you.</font>

213
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm raising less money</font>

214
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm not
jump-starting date rapists.</font>

215
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitter much?</font>

216
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:13,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say "bitter much" much?</font>

217
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say say "bitter much much" much?</font>

218
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my fault.
I used to wear a back brace.</font>

219
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why.</font>

220
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with the lava lamp?</font>

221
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:32,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a lava lamp.
It's my mom.</font>

222
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:33,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ho ho! Snap!</font>

223
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait... What?</font>

224
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">The temple finished vaporizing her.</font>

225
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mom's energon pod.</font>

226
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's her vapor
in those little bubbles.</font>

227
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that thing was free, right?</font>

228
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Energon doesn't grow on trees, Jeff.</font>

229
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:49,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's harvested by super bees
in a Buddhist meteor crater.</font>

230
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is at the foot of mount sky mall</font>

231
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the sharper image valley?</font>

232
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I overslept.</font>

233
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sidewalk is more
comfortable than it looks.</font>

234
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drunk. Glug, glug, glug.</font>

235
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:02,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. So where did
we get to yesterday?</font>

236
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are drunk and stupid.</font>

237
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:06,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, Ben, I do have
a wee big of a headache,</font>

238
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:07,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if you could just...</font>

239
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that interesting?</font>

240
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a right to be here, sir.</font>

241
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:17,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you do, you do,</font>

242
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:21,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I do hope you
have very good hearing.</font>

243
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard!</font>

244
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, where did we get to yesterday?</font>

245
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:30,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were talking about humanity,</font>

246
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:33,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">which starts with birth
and ends with death.</font>

247
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:34,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">True.</font>

248
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">All life ends in death,
which we, as a species,</font>

249
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:40,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">are cursed with knowing, resulting in...</font>

250
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:44,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something.</font>

251
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, this is really not my field.</font>

252
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, what would you say</font>

253
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">might be the difference between</font>

254
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">a religion and... a cult?</font>

255
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:56,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we open that
question to the floor,</font>

256
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">since I don't know</font>

257
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the book for this
class is expensive?</font>

258
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:01,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I would say a
cult might, for instance,</font>

259
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:04,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">sell you a tube of Jell-O</font>

260
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell you your mother is in it.</font>

261
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeffrey!
- I see... Are we thinly veiling</font>

262
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">a personal conflict and
passing it off as a lesson?</font>

263
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause if so, please continue.</font>

264
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reformed neo-buddhism is not a cult!</font>

265
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a new way of looking at the world,</font>

266
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">emphasizing empowerment.</font>

267
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like a video game?
- Yes, Troy.</font>

268
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very much like a video game.</font>

269
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gain levels, and at a certain point,</font>

270
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">you actually can eat a ghost.</font>

271
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I wanna eat a ghost!</font>

272
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, do not let him
pollute your brain</font>

273
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">with this crap, Troy.</font>

274
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay to ask questions.
- I have a question.</font>

275
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said your mother went
from a solid to a vapor.</font>

276
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do people in your religion
ever take liquid form,</font>

277
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the creatures in the abyss</font>

278
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:42,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">or children's Tylenol?</font>

279
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:44,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good question.</font>

280
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:47,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, when Buddha returns,</font>

281
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:48,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">we all take liquid form</font>

282
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:52,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">and merge into a shimmering
ocean of knowledge.</font>

283
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, according to scripture,
tastes like Hawaiian Punch.</font>

284
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do like Hawaiian Punch.</font>

285
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, if you're really curious,</font>

286
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:00,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">come to my church's open hive tomorrow.</font>

287
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, wine, beer,
free credit checks.</font>

288
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much wine and beer per person?</font>

289
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:07,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, come on!
- We're having a con... What?</font>

290
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Is this anesthesiology?</font>

291
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes, it is.</font>

292
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:14,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go with this.</font>

293
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really sad. Anything helps.</font>

294
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">So just anything you
could give would be...</font>

295
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

296
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:28,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like need you to save the pelicans.</font>

297
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all feathery and pelicany.</font>

298
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wuv them.</font>

299
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:35,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

300
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. It really is easy to raise money</font>

301
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:42,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you sell out your gender.</font>

302
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it's even easier</font>

303
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:46,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're not standing next to this.</font>

304
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:48,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, jerk! You're stupid!</font>

305
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gimme money. I know more than you.</font>

306
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know anything.</font>

307
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:53,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need boys.</font>

308
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saving the planet makes my back hurt.</font>

309
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:58,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I obviously don't
need guys for anything.</font>

310
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I wear stripper
boots during the day</font>

311
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">and eat only celery
and mustard for lunch!</font>

312
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I never stop smiling.
- I never start!</font>

313
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sweaters keep shrinking!</font>

314
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:11,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get up an hour early to
ever-so-slightly curl my hair.</font>

315
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're both so different.</font>

316
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:20,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Skinny bitches.</font>

317
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Billionaire Boys Club.</font>

318
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I ask what
happened in class today?</font>

319
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pulled 40 minutes of
anesthesiology out of your ass.</font>

320
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I did.</font>

321
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, uh, I meant your elderly friend.</font>

322
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how many times
I haven't eaten a donut?</font>

323
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do not.
- How much I got teased</font>

324
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">in grade school for dabbing
my pizza with napkins?</font>

325
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:42,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've suffered.</font>

326
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:44,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've denied myself.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

327
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the rules said if I did that,</font>

328
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would live longer.</font>

329
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then, halfway through the game,</font>

330
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:54,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get this little update that
it doesn't matter what I do.</font>

331
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could eat powdered bran every day</font>

332
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you suck down figgy pudding,</font>

333
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I still might die first.</font>

334
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:02,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unfair! I want my donuts back.</font>

335
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:06,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think you're being
a little childish, and...</font>

336
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a sec.
I need to use my force field</font>

337
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">to prevent Chang from getting food.</font>

338
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, where were we? Look...</font>

339
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:46,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way I see it, while
claiming to have no religion,</font>

340
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:49,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were actually devoutly
worshipping yourself.</font>

341
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:51,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now that your God
has high cholesterol,</font>

342
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're trying to kick
Pierce's in the balls.</font>

343
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

344
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I've been trying to
do is crush Pierce's faith</font>

345
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">to feel better about dying.</font>

346
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:03,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

347
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now that I realize
that that was my goal...</font>

348
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:06,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm?</font>

349
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can really roll up my sleeves</font>

350
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get it done.</font>

351
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:11,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There it is.
- Thank you!</font>

352
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:12,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

353
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that wasn't what I...
Actually, I don't care.</font>

354
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">He girls, guess who found Buddha.</font>

355
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:22,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hi.</font>

356
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:25,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on our way to
Pierce's buddhist open hive.</font>

357
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first I'm taking
these fellows for ice cream</font>

358
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:30,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an apology for
questioning Pierce's faith.</font>

359
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce says there's this
69th flavor I need to try.</font>

360
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am excited.</font>

361
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:35,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, my car's over there.</font>

362
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:36,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

363
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:38,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what.</font>

364
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not actually taking
them for ice cream.</font>

365
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am taking them to the county morgue</font>

366
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I have confirmed
that Pierce's mother's</font>

367
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">very un-vaporized corpse</font>

368
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be lying on a stainless steel slab</font>

369
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:50,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all to see.</font>

370
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise! Welcome to reality.</font>

371
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to death.</font>

372
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:55,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have fun.
- Good luck.</font>

373
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

374
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:59,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are real downers.</font>

375
00:15:59,177 --> 00:16:00,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I made
out with both of you.</font>

376
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:02,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

377
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:04,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll check the basket.</font>

378
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:06,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

379
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost arched my back a little.</font>

380
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:09,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you hate that.</font>

381
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I should count it.
Since I'm a calculating bitch.</font>

382
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I should, since I'm the one</font>

383
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's whoring out our gender!</font>

384
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give that back to me.
- I'm gonna count it!</font>

385
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let go!
- Gimme that!</font>

386
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah? Think this is funny?</font>

387
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think it's funny? Get off of me!</font>

388
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You little brat!
- Oh!</font>

389
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate you!</font>

390
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is why I came to America.</font>

391
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should listen to some music.</font>

392
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:43,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.</font>

393
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought the jam book
from the Pierce Mobile.</font>

394
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could play some of the old stuff,</font>

395
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:48,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you guys would make fun of me.</font>

396
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:50,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

397
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:54,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll throw ya... a bone
and put in some loggins.</font>

398
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ice cream place is far.</font>

399
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me. It's worth it.</font>

400
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

401
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mom's handwriting.</font>

402
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you were
doing in the garage,</font>

403
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:05,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">you silly goose?</font>

404
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">She spent her last
moments alive making a cd?</font>

405
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's gangster!</font>

406
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you found the CD,</font>

407
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:18,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means... I'm dead.</font>

408
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaporized.</font>

409
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:22,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not vaporized.
I'm gone, Pierce.</font>

410
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gone forever and...</font>

411
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's how I like it.</font>

412
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:32,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is only worth a
damn because it's short.</font>

413
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:36,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's designed to be consumed, used,</font>

414
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">spent, lived, felt.</font>

415
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're supposed to fill
it with every mistake</font>

416
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">and miracle we can manage.</font>

417
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:47,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we're supposed to let go.</font>

418
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:52,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't force you to do
that for yourself, Pierce.</font>

419
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't force me to stay.</font>

420
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:59,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you unscrew the
top of that stupid thing,</font>

421
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll see it was made in China.</font>

422
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:03,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, son.</font>

423
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:05,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-bye.</font>

424
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:08,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll play myself out.</font>

425
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whew.</font>

426
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that proves one thing.</font>

427
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:23,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">That woman was really losing her marbles</font>

428
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">toward the end.</font>

429
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... seriously still
think she's in there?</font>

430
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't I?</font>

431
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:38,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">No reason.</font>

432
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... Where's this ice cream place?</font>

433
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Oh... Um...</font>

434
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the... I think I...</font>

435
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually saw a better one back there.</font>

436
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:55,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place I was gonna take
you was... kinda depressing.</font>

437
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, can we get a little more
sawdust on that storm gutter?</font>

438
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:01,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

439
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:05,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry too.</font>

440
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:07,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got jealous of you.</font>

441
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but you totally called
me on what I was doing,</font>

442
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">and... I only kissed Jeff</font>

443
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I wanted to see if I could do it</font>

444
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I wanna be
cool and sexy like you.</font>

445
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:16,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe how gross I am.</font>

446
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only slept with Jeff
because I hate myself,</font>

447
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's why I got after
you for raising money.</font>

448
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm twice as gross.</font>

449
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know the reason</font>

450
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we raised more money in
five minutes of oil wrestling</font>

451
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">than we did in two days of fundraising?</font>

452
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because... men are even grosser?</font>

453
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:34,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when we forget that, they win.</font>

454
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. All right.</font>

455
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:41,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right.</font>

456
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, do it.</font>

457
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so you got actual ice cream.</font>

458
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. With peanut butter and hot Fudge.</font>

459
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, right?
Nobody lives forever.</font>

460
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">No offense.</font>

461
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:54,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, think what you want.
It's a free country.</font>

462
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I barely saw you this week, Abed.</font>

463
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you been up to?</font>

464
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not much.
- Hmm.</font>

465
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

466
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Busted! 25 feet!</font>

467
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which puts you in violation</font>

468
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">of this restraining
order I filed against you</font>

469
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:12,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">for abusing me with
your restraining order!</font>

470
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mutually assured destruction.</font>

471
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well played, Chang.</font>

472
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:21,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

473
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:22,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

474
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means a lot.</font>

475
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:27,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind getting a quick photo of me</font>

476
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the oily coeds?</font>

477
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:29,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Center button.
- Okay.</font>

478
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the man.
- Yeah, no problem.</font>

479
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:33,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha... whaaaat?</font>

480
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a projection.</font>

481
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:48,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the British guy pretending
to be Tom Berenger.</font>

482
00:20:52,857 --> 00:20:54,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a mislead.</font>

483
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole point of inception.</font>

484
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subversion of reality.</font>

485
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't seen it yet!</font>
