could please turn to page 12</font>

156
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">in my book...</font>

157
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:40,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loser!</font>

158
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really have to finish
that whole book by tomorrow?</font>

159
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:43,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's a page-turner.</font>

160
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on the chapter where he
traces Tony Micelli's genealogy</font>

161
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the way back to Caesar.</font>

162
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's gotta be better
than wine tasting with Pierce.</font>

163
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">He refused to drink Pinot Noir</font>

164
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he thought it was French
for "black penis."</font>

165
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's late. Again.</font>

166
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your fault.</font>

167
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your fault.</font>

168
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you</font>

169
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sure he'll be here.</font>

170
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't miss a chance to pop
in and say something offensive.</font>

171
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day soon, that man's gonna</font>

172
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">run out of ways
to shock people.</font>

173
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody,</font>

174
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is Wu Mei,</font>

175
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're getting married!</font>

176
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not gonna be today.</font>

177
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, you're getting married</font>

178
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">to that beautiful young thing?</font>

179
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, stranger things
have happened.</font>

180
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No, they haven't.</font>

181
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you guys just met?</font>

182
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday,
after wine tasting class.</font>

183
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mentioned
that her breasts were larger</font>

184
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">than most Asian women,</font>

185
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh,
we just got to talking.</font>

186
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turns out Pierce has been
to China many times.</font>

187
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only place
to get fireworks</font>

188
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">that are too dangerous
for Mexico.</font>

189
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I go
to visit my factory.</font>

190
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorne Wipes are the number
one moist towelette in Asia.</font>

191
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, after a few minutes,
we both just knew</font>

192
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">we were meant to be
together forever.</font>

193
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or at least
until she gets heavy.</font>

194
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, now we must leave you.</font>

195
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many plans to make.</font>

196
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, big plans.</font>

197
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what are we gonna do?</font>

198
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:04,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plan an engagement party?</font>

199
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your mind?
This is a scam.</font>

200
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:09,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's after him for his money
or a green card or something!</font>

201
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:09,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">They seem
to really like each other.</font>

202
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and Pierce married
three of his wives</font>

203
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">after knowing them
less than a month.</font>

204
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:14,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's just a romantic.</font>

205
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that you
would understand romance.</font>

206
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't preach to me
about romance, Annie.</font>

207
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a three-way
in a hot air balloon.</font>

208
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, I guess I'll do it myself.</font>

209
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Want to go?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

210
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, he seems really worked up.</font>

211
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't take on his pain.</font>

212
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tend your own garden.</font>

213
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you in class.</font>

214
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

215
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um, I didn't have
a painful experience</font>

216
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">to share in acting class,
so I made up this story</font>

217
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">about my uncle trying
to touch my butt.</font>

218
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta's attracted
to men in pain.</font>

219
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:51,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">It helps her pretend
to be mentally healthy.</font>

220
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:52,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

221
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't noticed.</font>

222
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:56,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy? Nothing good
can come of this.</font>

223
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

224
00:08:58,865 --> 00:08:59,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to think really hard</font>

225
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how to defuse
the situation.</font>

226
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, uncle Lucius!</font>

227
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to play
in the laundry room!</font>

228
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">My emotions!</font>

229
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">My emotions!</font>

230
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actors dismissed.</font>

231
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, for homework,</font>

232
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">drink a glass of cognac
in a bathtub.</font>

233
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:27,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, I feel like I'm seeing
a whole different side of you.</font>

234
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's just so much darkness.</font>

235
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:33,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my soul is darkening,</font>

236
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:37,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my heart is mad
at my kidneys, and...</font>

237
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mouth...</font>

238
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:45,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you tomorrow?</font>

239
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hello.</font>

240
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi.
I'm glad you could come.</font>

241
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please sit.</font>

242
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt like we got off
on the wrong foot yesterday,</font>

243
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wanted to offer you
my, uh, other foot.</font>

244
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, let me just say how happy
I am for you both.</font>

245
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:06,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents
must be so excited.</font>

246
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:07,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they coming to the wedding?</font>

247
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they would not miss it.</font>

248
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother will make
the customary shark's fin soup,</font>

249
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my father will get drunk</font>

250
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make bad impression
of Borat.</font>

251
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so your parents don't mind</font>

252
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">having a son-in-law
roughly their age?</font>

253
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:24,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Pierce
is a beautiful, wise man,</font>

254
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">very gentle soul.</font>

255
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, let me tell you
that I am a lawyer,</font>

256
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if you need any help at all</font>

257
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">navigating the whole green card
immigration hassle.</font>

258
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am dual citizen already.</font>

259
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, if you'd like me to
look at the prenup...</font>

260
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume you have one.</font>

261
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but my father's lawyers
will take care of this.</font>

262
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:47,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, we must protect
our family fortune.</font>

263
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

264
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm stumped.</font>

265
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:51,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

266
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, it was...</font>

267
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means it was very nice
talking to you.</font>

268
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, if you say so.</font>

269
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Right.
- Okay, good-bye.</font>

270
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why were you grilling her?</font>

271
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm gonna bust
into her apartment.</font>

272
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:08,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have
any grappling hooks.</font>

273
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Pierce finally found
his soul mate.</font>

274
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you say those things
without any trace of irony?</font>

275
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why they call me
irony-free Annie.</font>

276
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm, trust me,
that's not what they call you.</font>

277
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

278
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Mr. Abed.
What can I do for you?</font>

279
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finished your book,
Professor,</font>

280
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've been watching episodes
of <i>Who's the Boss?</i></font>

281
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think there's something
that you might have overlooked.</font>

282
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Abed,
will you look at my wall?</font>

283
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- What do you see?</font>

284
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Photographs.
- Of what?</font>

285
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You.
- With whom?</font>

286
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tony Danza, Judith Light,
Alyssa Milano,</font>

287
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,176
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who's the Boss?</i>
Season three caterer,</font>

288
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon "Giddy-up" Galligan.</font>

289
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have studied this show,
mister Abed.</font>

290
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not a fan,</font>

291
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not a groupie,</font>

292
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am an academic.</font>

293
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I ask the question,
"Who's the boss?"</font>

294
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a rhetorical question.</font>

295
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I ask the question beyond
the question, "What is a boss?"</font>

296
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really think it's Angela,
because if it's a boss...</font>

297
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, listen, enough!</font>

298
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like you to leave
my room.</font>

299
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mind is open, Professor.</font>

300
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as open as the door
to Mona's bedroom.</font>

301
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a shame yours isn't.
- I beg your pardon?</font>

302
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know?
I just got a wonderful idea.</font>

303
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you teach
the next class?</font>

304
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:25,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way you can share your
open mind with everybody.</font>

305
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
Cool cool cool.</font>

306
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pchew.</font>

307
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't be more touched</font>

308
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you all threw us
an engagement party.</font>

309
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said if we didn't,
you'd slash our tires.</font>

310
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is funny.</font>

311
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:38,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Oprah.</font>

312
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oprah's not a comedienne.</font>

313
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:44,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you are funny,
and you are like Oprah.</font>

314
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
What?</font>

315
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:47,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

316
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:51,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I'd like to offer
my sincere congratulations.</font>

317
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard enough to find people</font>

318
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can stand in this life,</font>

319
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">let alone someone
who's willing to stomach</font>

320
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:58,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">your imminent dementia
and present incontinence.</font>

321
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Jeff.</font>

322
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope she can satisfy me.</font>

323
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:04,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like an insatiable baboon
in the bedroom.</font>

324
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't sell yourself short.</font>

325
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a baboon everywhere.</font>

326
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like just yesterday</font>

327
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">me and Abed
dined and ditched here.</font>

328
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, hold this.</font>

329
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, what is this?</font>

330
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:24,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always carry some spare apps
in case the wait staff's racist.</font>

331
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's a napkin?</font>

332
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, here you go.</font>

333
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks.</font>

334
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check that out.</font>

335
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hats off to Pierce
and the hot red dragon.</font>

336
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:33,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you keep
calling her that?</font>

337
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hong Long" means red dragon.</font>

338
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's her middle name.</font>

339
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">In China, they
put the last name first.</font>

340
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:41,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
they're nuts over there.</font>

341
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:43,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm-hmm.</font>

342
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:49,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you all for coming.</font>

343
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it seems fast,</font>

344
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when you find the right
person, you just know it.</font>

345
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that because I've found
the right person seven times.</font>

346
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the drinks are on me,
but stick to the crappy stuff.</font>

347
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to get corn-holed
on the bar tab.</font>

348
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you can't just throw
around a term like that.</font>

349
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:05,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corn-hole.</font>

350
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corn-hole, corn-hole!</font>

351
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!
Troy was molested!</font>

352
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:12,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

353
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, we didn't know.</font>

354
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, do you need me
to recommend a support group?</font>

355
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, he's not a victim.</font>

356
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:23,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a survivor.</font>

357
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, about that...</font>

358
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't so much "molested"</font>

359
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:38,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">as much as I "made it up."</font>

360
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:39,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

361
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:42,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna laugh so hard
about this later.</font>

362
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to propose a toast.</font>

363
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:49,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wu Mei Hong Long, better known
as Mei Hong Long Wu,</font>

364
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not only
not a Greendale student,</font>

365
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">she works for Red Dragon Wipes,</font>

366
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,548

a takeover of Hawthorne Wipes.</font>

368
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">So please, raise your glasses</font>

369
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">to saving Pierce from
the clutches of a corporate spy,</font>

370
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to me for being
attractive enough</font>

371
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get a girl like her
under normal circumstances.</font>

372
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very impressive, Veronica Mars.</font>

373
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learned how to use Google.</font>

374
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you learned to fight
your physical desire for me.</font>

375
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, stick it.</font>

376
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suck.</font>

377
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait.</font>

378
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Record scratch app.</font>

379
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:41,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd everybody go?</font>

380
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:43,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most people went home.</font>

381
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest went with Chang
to your place</font>

382
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have a ketchup fight.</font>

383
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, jeez, I better
get back there</font>

384
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he starts
playing monkey drop.</font>

385
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ask.</font>

386
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, do you want to come?</font>

387
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I want to go
anywhere with Judas Winger?</font>

388
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mad at me?
You should be thanking me.</font>

389
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?
Ruining my relationship?</font>

390
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">What relationship?</font>

391
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just met the woman,
and the entire thing was a lie.</font>

392
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was just using you to get
your company in China.</font>

393
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was just using her to
get her company in the sack.</font>

394
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">People use each other Jeff.</font>

395
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't mean that
there aren't good feelings</font>

396
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">that go along with it.</font>

397
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:15,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I liked her.</font>

398
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was busty.</font>

399
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we had something.</font>

400
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to help you.</font>

401
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think what
you were trying to do,</font>

402
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">is prove that no woman
could want me.</font>

403
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:38,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're here.</font>

404
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Britta, I'm really sorry.</font>

405
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, kissing you
was a mistake.</font>

406
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will never happen again.</font>

407
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

408
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before my ex-boyfriend Pablo
was arrested</font>

409
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">for forging church relics,</font>

410
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">he accused me
of only being attracted</font>

411
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a certain kind of guy.</font>

412
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was hard
to understand him, though.</font>

413
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was pretty huffed up
on paint thinners.</font>

414
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:02,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe someday, you'll
fall for someone who's healthy.</font>

415
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:03,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who,</font>

416
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">other than his irrational fear
of automatic toilets,</font>

417
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">is... normal.</font>

418
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:13,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would like to begin today?</font>

419
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would.</font>

420
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a confession.</font>

421
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">My uncle never stuck
his finger in my plop-plop.</font>

422
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
I'm bummed about it, too.</font>

423
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

424
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... want to be interesting.</font>

425
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to fit in with you guys.</font>

426
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be able
to be an actor.</font>

427
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pain
of not having enough pain</font>

428
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">is still pain, young man.</font>

429
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may seem
like an easy resolution, but...</font>

430
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:52,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not writers.</font>

431
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're actors.</font>

432
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Story doesn't matter here.</font>

433
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:08,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that matters is our time</font>

434
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the spotlight.</font>

435
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so,
by all known definitions</font>

436
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the word "boss," I.E.,

otherwise hold dominion,</font>

440

<font color="#FFFFFF">the empirically provable answer</font>

441
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:28,628

my friend.</font>

447
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder why Jeff and Abed
didn't show?</font>

448
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:46,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know about Abed,</font>

449
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:49,105

found another life to destroy.</font>

about studying acting?</font>
