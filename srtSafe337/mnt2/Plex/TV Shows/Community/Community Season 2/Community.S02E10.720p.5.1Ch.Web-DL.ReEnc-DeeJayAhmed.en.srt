00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">To you!</font>

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was weird.</font>

3
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:09,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can we only sing the last two words?
What happening to the birthday part?</font>

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know Troy's a Jehovah's witness.
He doesn't celebrate birthdays.</font>

5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie and I did our best did our best to keep
the language on the cake compliant</font>

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hello during a random dessert,</font>

7
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">the month and day
of which coincide numerically</font>

8
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your expulsion from a uterus."</font>

9
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys, I never cry, but...
- All right.</font>

10
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:26,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy expulsion, Troy,</font>

11
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">but after cake,
we cram for realsies.</font>

12
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:30,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, finals are coming up.</font>

13
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this group is starting to use
special occasions to avoid studying.</font>

14
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:38,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, last week we had fondue and played boggle
because Shirley's niece took her bath.</font>

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With bubbles.
- Thank you.</font>

16
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a milestone.
- Funny, because last week</font>

17
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">was my birthday,
and nobody noticed and nobody cared.</font>

18
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:48,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce...</font>

19
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't remember
the huge party we threw?</font>

20
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk
about those pain killers you're taking.</font>

21
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't think
you're remembering anything.</font>

22
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:58,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was a huge party.
- It was the best party of my life!</font>

23
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotcha!</font>

24
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I remember my birthday.
What a party.</font>

25
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:09,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, you still owe me for the cake deposit.
- Oh, you think I don't know that?</font>

26
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:11,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy...</font>

27
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:13,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy...</font>

No way! This is sold out everywhere!</font>

31
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:50,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everywhere. I got a cousin in Detroit.
They're not crazy about it up there.</font>

32
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:52,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how you turn 20.
Thanks!</font>

33
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's strawberries under there.
- Let me, help you with that.</font>

34
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I broke my legs, not my gender.
- Ok.</font>

00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">While we're...
Watching this unfold,</font>

36
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">some birthday facts to enjoy.</font>

37
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy's birthday is tomorrow,
December 4th.</font>

38
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also born that day, Tyra Banks, Marisa Tomei,</font>

39
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">and French cinematographer
Claude Renoir.</font>

40
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:16,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes! Jackpot!
- On the Chinese calendar, Troy is a horse.</font>

41
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:17,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like me.</font>

42
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember because I'm determined,
self-possessed, and mendacious.</font>

43
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, what is this?
What are you doing? Explain yourself.</font>

44
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who made this crappy cake anyway?</font>

45
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A cake maker. At a cake store.
- They did it wrong.</font>

46
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, we're 1990. We're horses.</font>

47
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was born in '89.
- Then...</font>

48
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were born 21 years ago.</font>

49
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:42,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which would make me 20,
because everyone is 10 for two years.</font>

50
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:47,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because fifth grade is really hard
for every... one.</font>

51
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, how many lies have I been living!</font>

52
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, do you realize
at midnight you are turning 21</font>

53
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">as in "the legal drinking age"?</font>

54
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">This party just became unacceptable.
We're going out.</font>

55
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeap, but you were just complaining
about us having too many parties.</font>

56
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Too many lame ones. This is real.
- What makes it real?</font>

57
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well Shirley, think of it
as Troy taking his first bath,</font>

58
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">only the bubbles are his manhood.</font>

59
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I wanna bathe in manhood.</font>

60
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking you to I street.</font>

61
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:15,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Douche street.</font>

62
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, of course you hate cool bars.</font>

63
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose
you've ever even been to I street.</font>

64
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. But I also haven't been
to Beirut.</font>

65
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm sure I will go one day,</font>

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I hear they have lots
of important cultural...</font>

67
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It's my birthday</font>

68
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:33,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike I street, which is douchey.</font>

69
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alright, let's hear your great suggestions.
- The red door.</font>

70
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, the red door!
The red hipster.</font>

71
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not hipster.</font>

72
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hipsters haven't discovered it yet.
It's underound.</font>

73
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:44,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we go someplace fun
like peg leg Pablo's?</font>

74
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They serve virgin mudslides.
- Those are milk shakes, Shirley.</font>

75
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys!
All you think about is yourselves.</font>

76
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about me. I'm 19.
I can't get into bars.</font>

77
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:55,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well...
- Yeah, that must be tough, I was in those shoes</font>

78
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well...</font>

79
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:57,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun.</font>

80
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:03,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine. I'll get Annie an ID.
- A fake ID.?</font>

81
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll real. It just won't be yours.</font>

82
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will see you at the red door.</font>

83
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:08,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try. We're not going
to red poet's society.</font>

84
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:10,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're not going
to douche street either.</font>

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Count of three,
name the least offensive bar</font>

86
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:15,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've ever been to.
One, two, three.</font>

87
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Flannahan's hole.
- Flannahan's hole.</font>

88
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:19,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Done. Troy, you ride with me?
- Do you even have to ask?</font>

89
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pierce, do you wanna ride in my van?
- I'm not a disabled.</font>

90
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:24,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need people helping me</font>

91
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">doing normal things and doting over me and...
Why don't you just leave...</font>

92
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!
I'll beat you there.</font>

93
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think this girl
looks very much like me.</font>

94
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, she's a white brunette.
- So is Anne Hathaway.</font>

95
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:38,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on?</font>

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your friend doing
with a stack of other people's IDS?</font>

97
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:43,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know,
sometimes people sell their ID</font>

98
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they're leaving the state
and need cash.</font>

99
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she's a drifter.</font>

100
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">A floater.</font>

101
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">An urchin.</font>

102
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caroline Decker
from Corpus Christi, Texas.</font>

103
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:53,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Texas?</font>

104
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I need an accent?
- You don't need an accent.</font>

105
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Howdy, y'all. I'm Caroline Decker.
- Please don't do that.</font>

106
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guar-un-tee!</font>

107
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's Cajun.
- Hihi, Cajun.</font>

108
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I should research Corpus Christi.
- Annie, relax.</font>

109
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a relaxed person, Britta.
I think ahead.</font>

110
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:11,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prepare.
I don't improvise my life like...</font>

111
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caroline Decker,</font>

112
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">who probably has really bad credit
and an unfinished mermaid tattoo.</font>

113
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Flannahan's hole is closed.</font>

114
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a...</font>

115
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not being clever.
I mean it's out of business.</font>

116
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's what they get
for trying to please everyone.</font>

117
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So now what?
- There's a place at third and water.</font>

118
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:31,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fun, divey,
but not staph infection divey.</font>

119
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's either got a gross name
or an ironically fancy one.</font>

120
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:36,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Possibly both.
- Oh</font>

121
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:38,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ballroom. Good.
Go to third and water.</font>

122
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

123
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That wasn't the deal!
- Shirley's pushing back.</font>

124
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, 'cause they don't have
plastic menus and milk shakes?</font>

125
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why, 'cause they don't have...
- Don't repeat that, you goon!</font>

126
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:48,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez. Look, just...</font>

127
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">The women are your problem,
and the men are going to the ballroom.</font>

128
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:54,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I guess I am being clever.</font>

129
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, plastic menus are bad?</font>

130
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, this is the kinda stuff
I need to learn.</font>

131
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plastic menus seems like
a great idea to me</font>

132
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">for when you spill something on them,
and your mom says,</font>

133
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey Troy, you're ruining fuddruckers
for everyone."</font>

134
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy, you're entering
the next chapter of your life.</font>

135
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, it's the final chapter,
but it's also the longest.</font>

136
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you play it right, the best.</font>

137
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I...
We're just two guys now.</font>

138
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peers. Equals.</font>

139
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">So awesome. Maybe later
you'll let me drive your car.</font>

140
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

141
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, former enemy.</font>

142
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's 21 at midnight.
Cool?</font>

143
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.</font>

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,133

00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:35,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">and...?</font>

289
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:37,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really, really like
talking about <i>Farscape</i>.</font>

290
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a really good show.
- <i>Stargate</i>'s better.</font>

291
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,580
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Battery depleted</i>.</font>

292
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man</font>

293
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:58,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is wrong!</font>

294
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

295
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, there!</font>

296
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you been up to?</font>

297
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:06,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just praying</font>

298
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">for these poor souls
in these photographs.</font>

299
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice, but...</font>

300
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">you missed one.</font>

301
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found it in the ladies room.</font>

302
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:19,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give that to me.
- No, no, come on!</font>

303
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:22,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't feel bad.
This makes us like you way more.</font>

304
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think this is really funny.
- Yeah, a little.</font>

305
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:26,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had some bad years.</font>

306
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a chaser.</font>

307
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:32,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. It's a funny picture,
because you act so perfect all the time.</font>

308
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because you look like a zombie,</font>

309
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's not funny when you're sad.</font>

310
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on your team, relax.
Sit down, it's my birthday.</font>

311
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

312
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

313
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you all on Monday.</font>

314
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez</font>

315
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:49,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blue town.</font>

316
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley. Wait.</font>

317
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

318
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:58,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing. Get out of my way!
- I can't get out of your way.</font>

319
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm stuck in this pl...
The chair broke...</font>

320
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can't get...</font>

321
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please help me?</font>

322
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty please?</font>

323
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Shirley.</font>

324
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:12,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome, jackass.</font>

325
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, It's my birthday, and</font>

326
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:21,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">technically, I'm not allowed to drink
for another 45 seconds.</font>

327
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be 30 seconds
by the time I'm done saying this.</font>

328
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:27,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But can I have a seven and seven?
- It's on the house.</font>

329
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:28,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy birthday, kid.</font>

330
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:38,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer that to avatar.
I'd rather have my eyes gouged out.</font>

331
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine the hurt locker as radio play,
would be totally horrible and stupid...</font>

332
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big boy.
Big, big boy.</font>

333
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my big boy.</font>

334
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:17,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I owe you a birthday.</font>

335
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:18,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm cool.</font>

336
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wanted to drive this thing.</font>

337
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:22,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

338
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my car?</font>

339
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't crash it.
- I'm not gonna crash it!</font>

340
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:28,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crash it, Troy.</font>

341
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to sleep Britta.
Go to sleep.</font>

342
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:31,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crash his car, Troy!</font>

343
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like a really dark chapter
in our group story.</font>

344
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go to sleep, Abed.
- Cool.</font>

345
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's the place
that we shoulda gone to tonight!</font>

346
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I street. Exactly.</font>

347
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the red door, stupid!</font>

348
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:48,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You see a sign that says I street?
- I street is too cool to have a sign.</font>

349
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called I street
after the street it's on.</font>

350
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:54,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">The red door's on I street.</font>

351
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I street has a red door.</font>

352
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same bar?</font>

353
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:04,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two have been saying
one bar is lame</font>

354
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the other one is awesome,
all night...</font>

355
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:10,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's the same bar?</font>

356
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably was around Friday nights,
which was lame.</font>

357
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wish!</font>

358
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Just stop.</font>

359
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just spent the last two years,</font>

360
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinking that you guys
knew more than me about life,</font>

361
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:26,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just found out
that you guys are just as dumb as me.</font>

362
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh-doy.</font>

363
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, duh-doy.</font>

364
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

365
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh-doy.</font>

366
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:38,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duh-doy.</font>

367
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can take me home first.
I only live a few blocks from here.</font>

368
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

369
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:46,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a really
terrible neighborhood.</font>

370
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

371
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my apartment.</font>

372
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:54,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird night, huh?</font>

373
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah...</font>

374
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alcohol makes people sad.</font>

375
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:59,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like the lifetime movies
of beverages.</font>

376
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pretended to be
a different person tonight.</font>

377
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed does that three times a week.</font>

378
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I did it because
I didn't wanna be me.</font>

379
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:08,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it because...</font>

380
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure who I am.</font>

381
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:14,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Admit it, we went to school together for 4 years,
and you didn't even know me.</font>

382
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:16,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but...</font>

383
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you now.</font>

384
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:18,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Annie.</font>

385
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like puzzles and...</font>

386
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">little monsters on your pencil
and some guy named Mark Ruffalo.</font>

387
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fierce competitor
and a sore loser.</font>

388
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:31,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you expect everybody
to be better than who they are,</font>

389
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you expect yourself
to be better than everyone.</font>

390
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:36,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is cool.</font>

391
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:45,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

392
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess everyone's gonna be
pretty embarrassed on Monday?</font>

393
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

394
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:55,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody just got a little bit drunk.
Nobody did anything that bad, right?</font>

395
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait, wait, wait.</font>

396
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we doing?</font>

397
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, what are we doing?
- This is a bad idea, right?</font>

398
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

399
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok,</font>

400
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I flew off the handle earlier.</font>

401
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize.</font>

402
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They were making out.
- Abed, why would you say that?</font>

403
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you do it in front of me?
I'm not a coat rack.</font>

404
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:38,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed.</font>

405
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one likes a tattle tail.</font>

406
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy birthday, Troy.</font>

407
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:46,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

408
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a man now.</font>

409
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't think this will be big enough.
- Just try it, we're so close!</font>

410
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:07,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Breathe in.</font>

411
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arms.</font>

412
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 157!
- We did it!</font>

413
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

414
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you?</font>

415
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

416
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little help?</font>

417
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hurry. I think it's a girl!
- Left side or right side?</font>

418
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:32,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Left side.
- Got it. Tell me when I'm close.</font>

419
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok.</font>
