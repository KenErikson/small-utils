it takes papier-mache to dry?</font>

00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:07,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three hours longer</font>

think up this assignment.</font>

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think's really gonna appreciate</font>

00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:13,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">the extra work we did expanding
our evolutionary chart.</font>

6

the final stage of humanity?</font>

7
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still think that man is
going to evolve into woman,</font>

00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">not dragon monster with three legs.</font>

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three legs?</font>

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:24,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's been real...</font>

11
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least the paste smell has...</font>

12
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have a date to catch.</font>

13
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I say a catch to date.</font>

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof, hope you just
come up with that.</font>

15
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out! Drive-by deaning!</font>

16
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:35,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kidding.</font>

17
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a non-violent verbal reminder.</font>

18
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:41,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">The local shelter is having a
puppy parade this afternoon.</font>

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

20
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! I want to lick it.</font>

21
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect all of you to lend a paw.</font>

22

<font color="#FFFFFF">Except you, Jeffrey.</font>

23
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:50,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've gotta catch to date.</font>

24
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:52,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, like you're famous for your wit.</font>

25
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Puppy parade?</font>

26
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:54,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am in.</font>

27
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to see if those wiener
dogs are born that way,</font>

28
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">or if they start off normal
and then get wiener.</font>

29
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, did you pick up my pen?</font>

30
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a purple pen with a gel grip.</font>

31
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. I'm strictly
mechanical pencils these days.</font>

32
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:06,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">More relatable?</font>

33
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just here.</font>

34
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay, Annie? Chocolate?</font>

35
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like me to push
you to the parade, Pierce?</font>

36
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, thanks.</font>

37
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want people think
of me as a handicap.</font>

38
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:17,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, this chair
makes me more than a human.</font>

39
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You move it by blowing into this,
uh, tube here.</font>

40
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the most expensive one.</font>

41
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I outbid three hospitals for this baby,</font>

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was worth every penny.</font>

43
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

44
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:37,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

45
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Please just wait.</font>

46
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:46,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but I need
to know who took my pen.</font>

47
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

48
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:50,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I don't see it.</font>

49
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sorry, Annie.</font>

50
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:53,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

51
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not "sorry, Annie".</font>

52
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:59,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">We passed "sorry, Annie" eight pens ago!</font>

00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,703

and you guys keep taking them,</font>

putting my foot down.</font>

55
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:08,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, now, Annie has made it clear</font>

56
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:09,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this is an issue,</font>

57
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:12,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">so from now on, we need to be
more respectful of her things.</font>

58

80
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,430

<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed?</font>

94
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't do that. I
hate bottle episodes.</font>

101
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:56,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm!</font>

102
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that "hmm" directed at me?</font>

103
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the "hmm" fits.</font>

104
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have your pen, Annie.</font>

105
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm always lending you supplies.</font>

106
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never come prepared.</font>

107
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's so important to you,
here, have my pen.</font>

108
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my pen.</font>

109
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whatever, people.</font>

110
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just things.</font>

111
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since they're just things,</font>

112
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose you'd mind letting us</font>

113
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,015

114
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'd very much mind, Annie.</font>

115
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:19,182

00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then it's a brisk peeka-roony</font>

123
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the thought police
gonna make love to us?</font>

124
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,928

00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a puppy parade
halfway through, Britta?</font>

155
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is pointless.</font>

156
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you clearly stole the pen.</font>

157
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Patriot Act cuts both ways.</font>

158
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it's pretty one-sided.</font>

159
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's kind of the point.</font>

160
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's my point.</font>

161
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever's the pen thief
is just stood there</font>

162
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">and watched me get Guantanamoed.</font>

163
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd like to know who it is,</font>

164
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can let them know that
they have lost my trust forever.</font>

165
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:55,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bottle episode.</font>

166
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:57,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, we're sorry we embarrassed you</font>

167
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">and looked at your
prophylactic equipment.</font>

168
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lifestyle mistakes
are none of our business.</font>

169
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks, Shirley.</font>

170
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now let's rustle through
your tampons and wallet</font>

171
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can apologize to you.</font>

172
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:08,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sure everybody here
knows that I don't steal.</font>

173
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you checked your bag, Shirley?</font>

174
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you took it by
mistake, I forgive you.</font>

175
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so if I took it, it's larceny,</font>

176
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:16,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you find it under
mother hen, it's a mistake.</font>

177
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother hen? I think we're
about the same age.</font>

178
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, unless time is linear.</font>

179
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make your ass linear.</font>

180
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:21,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make any sense.</font>

181
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make ya ass sense.</font>

182
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:24,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, don't get your panties puckered.</font>

183
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all know what we're really thinking.</font>

184
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">If... and I mean if...
the culprit is among us,</font>

185
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">statistically speaking, it's Troy.</font>

186
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we were all just
thinking that in 1856.</font>

187
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">1856.</font>

188
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if a ghost took the pen?</font>

189
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please forgive him.
- For what?</font>

190
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">For stealing the pen, dummy.</font>

191
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I take her pen?</font>

192
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:45,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even like having my own.</font>

193
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably under
one of Pierce's casts.</font>

194
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">He uses everything to itch his legs.</font>

195
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on our third DVD remote.</font>

196
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I took the pen, I'd say so.</font>

197
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:53,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably forgot.</font>

198
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been popping
painkillers like tic-tacs.</font>

199
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, right.</font>

200
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:01,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Side effects: Verbal dysphasia"</font>

201
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:03,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and octopus loss."</font>

202
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see anything on this
squirrel about memory, Troy.</font>

203
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I want to know who has it.</font>

204
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:08,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, nice try Shirley,</font>

205
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't take you off the list.</font>

206
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, you're in charge.</font>

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I demand you deal with this</font>

208
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to deal with.</font>

209
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll say.</font>

210
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:17,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, alright, alright.</font>

211
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone breathe.</font>

212
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what this is?
- Yep.</font>

213
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. This is a normal day</font>

214
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:28,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a bunch of friends
who are done studying</font>

215
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:29,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a pen that maybe rolled away.</font>

216
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Rolled away"?
- Or fell down someone's shoe.</font>

217
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's check shoes.
- Annie!</font>

218
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, fine.</font>

219
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:42,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone in this room is hiding your pen.</font>

220
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to know why?</font>

221
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">They feel terrible.</font>

222
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">They made a mistake.</font>

223
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">They waited too long come forward,</font>

224
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now they feel bad.</font>

225
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They should.
- Mm-hmm!</font>

226
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:53,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Okay, so, pen thief,</font>

227
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:54,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">we understand what happened,</font>

228
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we forgive you.</font>

229
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you confess and apologize!
- Yes.</font>

230
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. But here's the trick.</font>

231
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:01,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because this person now has no reason</font>

232
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">not to come forward,</font>

233
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">if, by some chance,
I get to the count of three,</font>

234
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nobody comes forward, guess what.</font>

235
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:12,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to accept that no
one has the pen, don't we?</font>

236
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't we?</font>

237
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good so here we go.</font>

238
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:20,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

239
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:23,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two.</font>

240
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you have something to tell us?</font>

241
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Is it me,</font>

242
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:32,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">or has it become really obvious
that Jeff took the pen.</font>

243
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Definitely.</font>

244
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to make a bet, you jerks?</font>

245
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lockdown! Abed, seal the doors.</font>

246
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody leaves until this pen shows up.</font>

247
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like this.</font>

248
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Tell it to the pen
you might have.</font>

249
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gwynnifer? Hi. Yeah, it's me.</font>

250
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't make it.</font>

251
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:50,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, tell your disappointment
to suck it.</font>

252
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing a bottle episode!</font>

253
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:13,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

254
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just became my hero.</font>

255
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:16,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

256
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:17,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">No pen.</font>

257
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:18,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see that.</font>

258
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you keep taking
that tone with me?</font>

259
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'll field that</font>

260
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if nobody else has this pen,</font>

261
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">it means at so point,
you realized you had it</font>

262
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:27,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">and were too embarrassed to say,
and we get to kill you.</font>

263
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not hiding my own pen,
you paranoid weirdo.</font>

264
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody stay within each
other's eyelines, please.</font>

265
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:33,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of you's a monster.</font>

266
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me next, right?
- Hold on.</font>

267
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we please consider</font>

268
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:37,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">the threshold that we are crossing?</font>

269
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't trust Abed?</font>

270
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shredded my backpack.</font>

271
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">He freed my pet monkey.</font>

272
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:44,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we corrupted him.</font>

273
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's our innocent.</font>

274
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put gum in your hair.</font>

275
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:47,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Empty the bag, Abed.</font>

276
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Pierce,</font>

277
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">- you don't have a bag?
- Giraffe.</font>

278
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Jeff, you don't have a bag?</font>

279
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:53,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I could never deprive the world</font>

280
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the portion of my chest
the strap would cover.</font>

281
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes sense. So what's left?</font>

282
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, a little hugging and crying,
and then we're done?</font>

283
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, Abed, why is my name in here?</font>

284
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's mine.</font>

285
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Shirley's and Annie's?</font>

286
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:06,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

287
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:07,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charts.</font>

288
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some kind of calendar?</font>

289
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my personal private business.</font>

290
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, 4 on, 28 off,
next, November 10th.</font>

291
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, 5 on, 27 off...</font>

292
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:21,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my God. Are you charting
our menstrual cycles?</font>

293
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

294
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gross!</font>

295
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:25,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, this is so personal!</font>

296
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so accurate.</font>

297
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:27,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, this is really creepy.</font>

298
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand
why you would do this.</font>

299
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can explain.</font>

300
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I thought you'd keep
yelling over me.</font>

301
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:33,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I can explain.</font>

302
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I have trouble reading people,</font>

303
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">and say the wrong things, sometimes,</font>

304
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:37,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I noticed it was happening
more often with you three</font>

305
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">than it was with the others.</font>

306
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I noticed fluctuating patterns,</font>

307
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:41,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I started graphing them,</font>

308
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and by the time I realized
what I was actually measuring,</font>

309
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">it had started to yield really
positive results for everybody,</font>

310
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I kept doing it.</font>

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you ever gonna tell us about this?</font>

312
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I feel so violated.</font>

313
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">More chocolate?</font>

314
00:10:57,231 --> 00:10:59,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Get away from me!</font>

315
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed just became my hero.</font>

316
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I have a little...
- No!</font>

317
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheesh.</font>

318
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess it's true what they say
about the sync-up.</font>

319
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:07,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if I could just take this time</font>

320
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:08,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">to share a few words of sarcasm</font>

321
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">with whoever it is that took this pen.</font>

322
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to say thank you
for doing this to me</font>

323
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:14,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a while I thought
I'd have to suffer</font>

324
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:14,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">through a puppy parade,</font>

325
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I much prefer being entombed alive</font>

326
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a mausoleum of feelings</font>

327
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can neither understand
nor reciprocate.</font>

328
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">So whoever you are,
can I get you anything?</font>

329
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:23,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ice cream? Best friend medal?</font>

330
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything? Mm-mmm?</font>

331
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, sarcasm over.</font>

332
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:28,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're last up, Shirley.</font>

333
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dump your comedically
huge bag and end this.</font>

334
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no, thank you.</font>

335
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:37,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well, Harvey Keitel.</font>

336
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:40,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you know,
Henry David Thoreau.</font>

337
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">My oh my, Mike Tyson</font>

338
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:45,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">just empty the bag.</font>

339
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I don't have Annie's pen.</font>

340
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:49,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm simply a Christian woman
that doesn't open her bag.</font>

341
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did the Christian woman
think would happen</font>

342
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we got to her bag?</font>

343
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:54,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Christian woman thought
you'd find it on the Muslim.</font>

344
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:55,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real nice!</font>

345
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicer than you, condom carrier!</font>

346
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dump the bag or you're guilty!
- No!</font>

347
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lord, he's thrown a clot!</font>

348
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce! Call 911!</font>

349
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

350
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you didn't need to do that.</font>

351
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:08,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did.</font>

352
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you guys do is talk,</font>

353
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">leaving me to do the
things you won't do.</font>

354
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:13,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">People like you are the reason</font>

355
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">we took so long to get into Vietnam.</font>

356
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you were
trying to hide, Shirley?</font>

357
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pregnancy test?</font>

358
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:22,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">And more importantly,</font>

359
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">are they seriously marketing
pregnancy tests to black women</font>

360
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:27,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">guys! This is a terribly childish way</font>

361
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">to handle this kind of situation.</font>

362
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:32,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does this mean you have a new boyfriend?</font>

363
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who, who, who?</font>

364
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:37,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that it's, uh, anyone's business...</font>

365
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recently reconnected with
my husband over Labor Day,</font>

366
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it seems the Lord
may have a plan for us</font>

367
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't include that
stripper slut he ran away with.</font>

368
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not pregnant, Shirley.
It's impossible.</font>

369
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does everybody think I'm old?</font>

370
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:49,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm around Jeff's age!
I have a uterus!</font>

371
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. According to my charts,</font>

372
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">you couldn't have
conceived Labor Day weekend</font>

373
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would have been
ovulating on Halloween.</font>

374
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is just as well,
because if you're gonna have</font>

375
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">a pregnant woman in one of these,</font>

376
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:58,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say go elevator labor or go home.</font>

377
00:12:58,876 --> 00:12:59,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halloween?</font>

378
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's that, then.</font>

379
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what a relief.</font>

380
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone narrowly avoided</font>

381
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">a "lifestyle mistake" of their own.</font>

382
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:09,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Or is it only bad if
you sleep with unmarried men?</font>

383
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bible doesn't
recognize divorce, Britta!</font>

384
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:12,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you marry a man, he's your man!</font>

385
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and after he marries someone else,</font>

386
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you jump into the sack
with him, you're an angel,</font>

387
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">so long as you don't use protection?</font>

388
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:21,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad you're enjoying this.</font>

389
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I hope whoever stole
that pen enjoys it in hell!</font>

390
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:27,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice try, Stephen Fry.
- "Stephen Fry."</font>

391
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have an agreement.</font>

392
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody leaves till we find it.</font>

393
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh
- Get off. Here we go.</font>

394
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are gonna find this pen!</font>

395
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:39,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are gonna find that pen!</font>

396
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- And if we can't find it,</font>

397
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:43,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">our children will find it!</font>

398
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:45,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it over here in these books?</font>

399
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">This pen? This incredible, magical pen</font>

400
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">that nobody knows how
it could disappear?</font>

401
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, maybe it's right in here!</font>

402
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is school property!</font>

403
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we just forget it?</font>

404
00:13:58,084 --> 00:13:59,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pen!</font>

405
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:10,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pen now?</font>

406
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

407
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a principle anymore</font>

408
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">now it's a pen?</font>

409
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the change of heart?</font>

410
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not seriously accusing me.</font>

411
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">We searched my bag!</font>

412
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is exactly the
last place you'd put it</font>

413
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you found it halfway
through all this.</font>

414
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:34,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, assuming that one
of us does have the pen,</font>

415
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">who among us has the most incentive</font>

416
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:39,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make sure it never
sees the light of day?</font>

417
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You want to go there?
- Yeah.</font>

418
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go there.
- Okay.</font>

419
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:42,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was born there.
- Really?</font>

420
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:45,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a placard the commemorating me!</font>

421
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, and how can I help?</font>

422
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anie, relax.</font>

423
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you relax, Jeff.</font>

424
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or are you scared that if
you do, my pen will fall out?</font>

425
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">You precocious little bitch!</font>

426
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, guys, guys! Hey!</font>

427
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, stop!</font>

428
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being complely illogical!</font>

429
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:01,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to flip up the table,
divide the group by gender,</font>

430
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then search each
other in our underwear.</font>

431
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:04,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

432
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:06,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what?</font>

433
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:09,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody shake. Enough to dislodge.</font>

434
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, anything hit the floor?</font>

435
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

436
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are those underwear made out of?</font>

437
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:18,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">They look luxurious.</font>

438
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. They're an organic
soy-cotton blend.</font>

439
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Gwynnifer must be real special.</font>

440
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you usually wear</font>

441
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">the stripey turquoise
beetlejuice numbers?</font>

442
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does she mean "usually"?</font>

443
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:29,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, end of the road.</font>

444
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:30,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've torn apart the room,</font>

445
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:31,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've stripped.</font>

446
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is absolutely no place left...</font>

447
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:38,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

448
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:40,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

449
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:46,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

450
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noooooo! No!</font>

451
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:53,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it. Broke my scissors.</font>

452
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:56,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Be careful.</font>

453
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the last pair we have.</font>

454
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, don't cut his legs.</font>

455
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm worried we've gone too far.</font>

456
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how super villains are created.</font>

457
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you just make an inspiring
Winger speech about trust,</font>

458
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:09,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">throw in a few digs at
an easy celebrity target,</font>

459
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put a ribbon on this thing?</font>

460
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, think about this for one second</font>

461
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">if a single one of us leaves this room</font>

462
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">before we find that pen,</font>

463
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">how can any of us trust anyone
in this group ever again?</font>

464
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your hurry?</font>

465
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:25,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm clothing myself.</font>

466
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not comfortable standing
around in my all-together</font>

467
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you two anorex jeze...</font>

468
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! I'm so sorry.</font>

469
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:32,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was really mean.</font>

470
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know where that came from.</font>

471
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all been through a lot today.</font>

472
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm sure this pregnancy scare</font>

473
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">been weighing on you all week, right?</font>

474
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:44,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe that's why you took my pen?</font>

475
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:44,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

476
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you hiding it, judgy beans?</font>

477
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, here we go.</font>

478
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">It smells like a Waffle House sink!</font>

479
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:59,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, are you using Slim Jims
to scratch your legs?</font>

480
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:03,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have we not gotten to a
place free of judgment yet?</font>

481
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't it, this isn't it.</font>

482
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it? Where's the pen?</font>

483
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the pen?</font>

484
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the pen?</font>

485
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:11,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

486
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting a little chilly outside,</font>

487
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the animal wranglers
have asked that every student</font>

488
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">pick up a puppy and hold it,</font>

489
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:19,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they stay warm while the volunteers</font>

490
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">hand out tiny, puppy-sized hats.</font>

491
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, I don't know why I'm even
making these announcements.</font>

492
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">There can't be anyone who
isn't already on the quad!</font>

493
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, I'd just like to say,</font>

494
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:42,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">on behalf of whoever
actually stole this pen,</font>

495
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I real am sorry about all this.</font>

496
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:45,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it was you.</font>

497
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:46,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it was you.</font>

498
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is it could be any of you.</font>

499
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for all we know, it's you.</font>

500
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish it were. I really do.</font>

501
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:55,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could just
find it behind my ear.</font>

502
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather be that stupid
than think that anyone of us</font>

503
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">might be this inconsiderate.</font>

504
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all we've been through,
it almost seems impossible.</font>

505
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:08,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems less than impossible.</font>

506
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something impossible</font>

507
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">actual seems more likely.</font>

508
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:14,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

509
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winger speech to take us home.</font>

510
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if a ghost took the pen?</font>

511
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let him finish
- I am finished.</font>

512
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real, honestly, seriously, why not?</font>

513
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not just "a ghost took the pen"?</font>

514
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I've been saying that for hours.</font>

515
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we should've listening
to Troy from the beginning.</font>

516
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, look in your hearts</font>

517
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">and answer this question honestly:</font>

518
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:34,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's more likely?</font>

519
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">That someone in this group
doesn't belong in this group?</font>

520
00:18:37,823 --> 00:18:39,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or ghosts?</font>

521
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we have to choose between
turning on each other</font>

522
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">or pinning it on some specter</font>

523
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">with unfinished, pen-related business,</font>

524
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but my money's on ghost.</font>

525
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm not a religious person,</font>

526
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've seen specials
on the paranormal.</font>

527
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything's possible.</font>

528
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relative to the alternative,</font>

529
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:00,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">it actually seems more logical to me.</font>

530
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would a ghost want a pen?</font>

531
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:07,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troy?</font>

532
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:10,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

533
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I see it as a lot like
the movie paranormal activity,</font>

534
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">except for more boring and fancy.</font>

535
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think in 1856,</font>

536
00:19:19,732 --> 00:19:21,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is possible that a man was beheaded</font>

537
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">while he was writing in his diary</font>

538
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">to his long lost love,</font>

539
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:27,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now he roams the halls of Greendale</font>

540
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">screaming for his pen so he
can write her a love letter.</font>

541
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I need her! I need her!" he screams,</font>

542
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">as he looked for a pen.</font>

543
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:46,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell did you
people do in there?</font>

544
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you and your puppies
could only dream of</font>

545
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">you non-miraculous son of a bitch.</font>

546
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Non-miraculous?</font>

547
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Abed!</font>

548
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who could resist falling
in love with our next float?</font>

549
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:42,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">This autumn colors puppy
reminds us that</font>

550
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">while the leaves
might be changing,</font>

551
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">responsible pet ownership
is always in season.</font>

552
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:52,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here's a crowd favorite,
the Top and Tails float.</font>

553
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">A champagne bath
and a red sports car?</font>

554
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's hope he's single.</font>

555
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok... Oh, okay. Well...</font>

556
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:02,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one feels
a little preachy. Oh.</font>

557
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo! Boo!</font>
