I live with you.</font>

- Great. How are you doing?</font>

29

34
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:07,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we know she's coming back?
She never returned any of my calls or e-mails.</font>

36

- How's it going?</font>

42
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, yeah. I made an ass
of myself and Jeff at that dance.</font>

43
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was caught up in a competition
with his turd of an ex-girlfriend,</font>

44
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wish I could erase
the entire night.</font>

45
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I owe you an apology.
- I accept.</font>

46
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:42,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sweetie, you don't owe us anything
and you don't have to hide from us.</font>

47
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You? I'm hiding from them.
It's like high school all over again.</font>

48
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psycho Britta,

embarrassed me that night too, so call it karma.</font>

51
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, boy, I hope I'm not around
when you do mean to be a tool.</font>

52
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:04,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just put this behind us
and just walk to class, okay?</font>

53
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

54
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:12,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're Britta Perry?
- Yeah, what's it to you?</font>

55
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the coolest.</font>

56
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:16,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Um...</font>

57
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:18,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">At what exactly?</font>

58
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:22,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being fearless, honest,
speaking from your heart.</font>

59
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Jeff Winger, I love you".
- Right.</font>

60
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My heart may have overstated...
- Do you sign stuff?</font>

61
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now and again.
- Awesome.</font>

62
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like where that's going.</font>

63
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, right?</font>

64
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look...</font>

65
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:41,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">uhm, remember the little talk we had?</font>

66
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one about discretion?
Yes. Stop that.</font>

67
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, uhm, we agreed you and I kissing
was a mistake.</font>

68
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, if anyone were to find out about it,
I would be tarred, feathered,</font>

69
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put on one of those websites
people check when buying a house.</font>

70
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:57,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's forgotten, Jeff.
Jeez, I'm not some love-struck teenybopper.</font>

71
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you should know, we didn't just kiss,
we technically frenched.</font>

72
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:02,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked the make-out meter

81
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you guys in this class?
We chose it together.</font>

82
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real question is,
why are you in it?</font>

83
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, you missed us?
- Oh!</font>

84
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't flatter yourself. Ok, have you
checked out the course description?</font>

85
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:08,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient weaponry? Genital mutilation?
This subject's talking my Chang-uage.</font>

86
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

87
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:19,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

88
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Star-Burns has grown reliant
on his star-shaped sideburns,</font>

89
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">but still craves identity beyond them,
so he added a hat.</font>

90
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, what's up with Britta-mania?
Oh, that's even simpler.</font>

91
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:32,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the eyes of the public, Britta put herself out there
and you walked away,</font>

92
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">making her the underdog,
the GLT, the Aniston.</font>

93
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah.</font>

94
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Jeff, do you have any hillbilly cousins?
I wish, why?</font>

95
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about a wealthy uncle, or and old drinking buddy,
that may or may not have had a sex change?</font>

96
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, why are you mining my life
for sitcom scenarios?</font>

97
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm just excited about the new year,
looking for ways to improve things.</font>

98
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm hoping we can move away
from the soapy relationship-y stuff,</font>

99
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:52,879

<font color="#FFFFFF">Divorce?</font>

102

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tools. Like this blowgun I used
to hunt monkeys</font>

103
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,016

105
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:22,084

to the very threshold of your humanity,</font>

106
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,653

with the shrieking, blood-drenched,</font>

make a diorama.</font>

109
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your first assignment,
I would like you to form tribes</font>

110
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:41,134

and if you can, mix up the races.</font>

111
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:44,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you'll be surprised
at how quickly things get awkward.</font>

112
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:50,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, now that Troy's off the streets
and living with me,</font>

113
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's learning so much about the world.</font>

114
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:55,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Tell me again
why Jewish people wear yarmulkes.</font>

115
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half a hat, saves money.</font>

116
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

117
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Half a hat"? That is so offensive.</font>

118
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love <i>Old White Man Says </i>.</font>

120
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chang, I'm starting to think
you took Anthropology,</font>

121
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you wanna be in our group,
but are too proud to ask.</font>

122
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Keep dreaming, Winger.</font>

123
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,577

129
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, can we talk?</font>

130
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:46,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now he wants to talk.
No, it's fine, I'll be right back.</font>

131
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:51,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, you got some real passionate fans.
Eh. It'll blow over.</font>

132
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, would you mind, uhm,
helping it blow over?</font>

133
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">My stock is kind of plummeting
around here.</font>

134
00:07:57,156 --> 00:08:01,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't mean to sound like a tool,
but maybe it's karma.</font>

135
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta I know you're excited
to finally be popular with women,</font>

136
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:06,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">but don't get too high
on your own drama.</font>

137
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:10,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">High on my own drama?</font>

00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:27,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not every woman. Certainly not the one
that deserves to be with you.</font>

143
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:30,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, all women deserve to be with me,
and vice versa.</font>

144
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Granted, but who doesn't eventually
settle down?</font>

145
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't, and I never will. And if I did...</font>

146
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I did,</font>

147
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could beat Britta
at her own game.</font>

148
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:49,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good.
Yeah, you better take a hike.</font>

149
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
where the cleanest bathroom is?</font>

150
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Teacher's lounge.
- Thank you.</font>

151
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be shy, come on up,
have a sip.</font>

152
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:01,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The yogi of India swear by
its restorative powers.</font>

153
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:07,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, more of my urine for me.</font>

154
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, for your tribe's assignment.</font>

155
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:13,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">This box contains
nine different tools,</font>

156
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of them important
to humanity's survival.</font>

157
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:20,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them,
is the most important of all.</font>

158
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:26,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your tribe's assignment for tomorrow
is to tell me which tool that is.</font>

159
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Questions?
I have a question.</font>

160
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not for you.</font>

161
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:32,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for Britta.</font>

162
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta.</font>

163
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:38,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

164
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:46,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I know this puts you
in an awkwardly powerful position,</font>

165
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have to know, right now,
in front of everyone.</font>

166
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you love me too?</font>

167
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than anything in the world.</font>

168
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

169
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:06,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So it begins.
- Hmm.</font>

170
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">The greatest relationship
ever known.</font>

171
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is making me sick.</font>

172
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna love you forever.
- Good, I'm gonna love you forever.</font>

173
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't believe you.
- Why, don't you want me to?</font>

174
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I do. Bring it.</font>

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't it make you wanna cry?</font>

176
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something like that. Excuse me.</font>

177
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I downloaded a song
that makes me think of you.</font>

178
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's listen to it,
each using one ear bud.</font>

179
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, would you consider spinning off with me?</font>

180
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just riffing, but we could open
a hair salon together.</font>

181
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.
Is this you being meta?</font>

182
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to come out of the gate having adventures,
like paintball. This is boring.</font>

183
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:05,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think that's selfish, Abed.
If you were a friend to Jeff and Britta,</font>

184
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would see their relationship
as an adventure.</font>

185
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:12,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't thought about it that way.
Oh! Look at how they walk.</font>

186
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:19,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, the most important tool to a tribe's survival is here.
The cross, representing Christianity.</font>

187
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an ax.
It's an ax?</font>

188
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:25,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the telescope. Look through
it backwards. Shrink your enemies.</font>

189
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you the tool that's
most important to our survival,</font>

190
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:31,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">but fair warning, it's my penis.</font>

191
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:40,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old White Man.</font>

192
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:42,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.
I was in my car loving Britta.</font>

193
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:50,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I guess I just love you too much.
- Not half as much as me.</font>

194
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:53,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aww.
- Jeff, do you think you'll marry Britta?</font>

195
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'd like to see someone stop me.
- I just peed a little.</font>

196
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then here, propose.
- Oh.</font>

197
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it, I got it, got it.
Jeff Winger, will you marry me?</font>

198
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course.</font>

199
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.
Perfect, I'll be right back.</font>

200
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank the Lord, you're getting married.
I was so worried about your souls,</font>

201
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever since you had pre-marital sex
on the table.</font>

202
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

203
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

204
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You told Shirley?
- Well, there's no need for secrecy now.</font>

205
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:30,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was during the paintball game.</font>

206
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:33,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was there anything
you didn't win that day?</font>

207
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

208
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:39,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slept with her
and then kissed me?</font>

209
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

210
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:48,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Now they're in so deep. ♪</font>

211
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:52,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ You know she's such a fool for him. ♪</font>

212
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ She has a ring around her finger, ♪</font>

213
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:00,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ and Abed hired an Irish singer. ♪</font>

214
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:04,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Britta's marrying, Britta's marrying
Britta's marrying Jeffrey Winger ♪</font>

215
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:08,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell is this?
- A wedding, episode.</font>

216
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Abed, there's no wedding.
- Cold feet?</font>

217
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk it over with your best man,
George Clooney.</font>

218
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:14,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's up?
- He's a George Clooney impersonator,</font>

219
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but still razzle-dazzle, right?
- Abed?</font>

220
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

221
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jeff made out with Annie.
- What?</font>

222
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When? Where?
- Yeah, where?</font>

223
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's inappropriate.
I'm assuming on the mouth.</font>

224
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was after the Transfer Dance.
- Oh!</font>

225
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:32,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I tell you that I love you, and then you go
outside and stick your tongue into a teenager?</font>

226
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is wrong with you, Jeffrey?</font>

227
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:39,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well Shirley, since you have clearly failed
to grasp the central insipid metaphor</font>

228
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">of those <i>Twilight</i> books you devour,
let me explain it to you.</font>

229
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men are monsters
who crave young flesh. The end.</font>

230
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:49,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least we have the decency
to be ashamed of it and keep it a secret,</font>

231
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of publicly blurting <i>I love you</i>
to everyone who sleeps with us.</font>

232
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please, I never loved you.
Ah-ha!</font>

233
00:13:56,615 --> 00:14:00,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I win, I win, I win. In your face.</font>

234
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this was all a game?</font>

235
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything they do
is some sick competition.</font>

236
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... like you hate competition.</font>

237
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:09,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long did it take you to kiss Jeff
after I told him I loved him?</font>

238
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's right.
First Vaughn, now Jeff.</font>

239
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I better not smile at that wall outlet
or you'll fry your tongue off!</font>

240
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to hog all the girls, Jeff.</font>

241
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:21,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when there's three sprinkle doughnuts,
you don't eat one and then lick another.</font>

242
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone object to us
being referred to as doughnuts? No one?</font>

243
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry we can't all be
as honorable as you Troy.</font>

244
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:28,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And post Pierce quotes
all day on Twitter.</font>

245
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:32,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, is that your lame attempt
to try and pass the hot seat to me?</font>

246
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice try.
- Wait, I'm <i>Old White Man Says</i>?</font>

247
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder he says
everything I'm thinking.</font>

248
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:41,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bastard.</font>

249
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just sharing what you say.</font>

250
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, what if I shared
all the stuff you say?</font>

251
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks all dogs are boys
and all cats are girls.</font>

252
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way to disprove that.
Have you ever seen a cat penis?</font>

253
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

254
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you canceled.</font>

255
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good. Yeah Abed, cancel us.
And while you're at it,</font>

256
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't you take your cutesy
"I can't tell life from TV" gimmick with you?</font>

257
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's very "season one".</font>

258
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell life from TV, Jeff.</font>

259
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:18,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">TV makes sense, it has structure,
logic, rules, and likable leading men.</font>

260
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:21,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">In life we have this.</font>

261
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have you.</font>

262
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on the clock for another hour if
you want me to do some <i>Batman</i> lines.</font>

263
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not sitting with your little group?
- The group is done.</font>

264
00:15:56,371 --> 00:16:00,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well,
missionary accomplished, right?</font>

265
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?
Come on, I know you and Britta did it.</font>

266
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't the whole reason
you got together with those people?</font>

267
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you wanted to bang
the blond?</font>

268
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I hear
that you Frenched the brunette.</font>

269
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">What more could you have gotten
out of that group?</font>

270
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, class.</font>

271
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:21,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's dive in and hear the results
of your assignment.</font>

272
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wants to go first?</font>

273
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Mr. Winger,
the last time I called on you,</font>

274
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kind of got what the Maku-Maku
call "dirt-roaded."</font>

275
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using it.</font>

276
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm sorry about that.</font>

277
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:37,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a trick question.</font>

278
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tool most important
to humanity's survival</font>

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">wasn't any of the nine in the box.</font>

280
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

281
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most important tool is respect.</font>

282
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha! Gay.</font>

283
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the reason I know
respect is a tool,</font>

284
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:59,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">is because it is clearly
not a natural thing</font>

285
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we forget to use it all the time.</font>

286
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:05,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we start competing with
each other, and exploiting each other,</font>

287
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:08,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">and humiliating each other,
and controlling each other.</font>

288
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we lose each other.</font>

289
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">And without each other,
we'll go extinct.</font>

290
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's a fact.</font>

291
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh. A gay fact.</font>

292
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my answer, professor.</font>

293
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:22,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

294
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's one answer.</font>

295
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the one I had in mind.</font>

296
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Combining all nine tools,
you get this,</font>

297
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">a deadlier weapon
than any one item in the box.</font>

298
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'm gonna use this to attack you,</font>

299
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you use respect
to defend yourself.</font>

300
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Oh... Uh...</font>

301
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.</font>

302
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I respect you.</font>

303
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you fail.</font>

304
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.</font>

305
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's passing out.</font>

306
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with us, buddy.</font>

307
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello.
- Oh, thank God.</font>

308
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello Jeffrey.</font>

309
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

310
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Bauer got suspended,
and we got an automatic A on our assignment.</font>

311
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone throw urine in my face?</font>

312
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sometimes I surprise myself under pressure.</font>

313
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, about the assignment,
we decided you had the right answer.</font>

314
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need more respect
and a little less passion.</font>

315
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which will be easy for me,
because I think you're kinda gross now.</font>

316
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awesome.</font>

317
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I'm gonna delete
that Twitter account.</font>

318
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friendship is more important
than 600,000 strangers.</font>

319
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, wow, wow. Are you saying 600,000
people read what I say on Twitter?</font>

320
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, we gotta cash in on that.</font>

321
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about <i>Old White Man Says,</i>
<i>the TV Show?</i></font>

322
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Who would watch that?</font>

323
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of bad development
strategy, I owe you all an apology.</font>

324
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying so hard
to make our first week a great one,</font>

325
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I didn't realize there was something great
in front of us the whole time.</font>

326
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">An old woman drinking her own pee.</font>

327
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're Right.
- That's true.</font>

328
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

329
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a confession to make.</font>

330
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took <i>Anthropology</i> because
I wanna be a part of your study group.</font>

331
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I gotta do the honest thing
and just ask.</font>

332
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:18,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any room in this pocket
for a little spare Chang?</font>

333
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... look, we've been through a lot today.</font>

334
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give us a little time to think it over.
- Totally, totally, man.</font>

335
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just think about it.
Take your time and let me know.</font>

336
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:31,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye.
- See you, Chang.</font>

337
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

338
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww. Poor guy.
We'll let him in eventually.</font>

339
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says who?</font>

340
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we have the strength
to survive anything.</font>

341
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the worst that can happen
with Chang?</font>

342
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah, Good point.</font>

343
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you they hate you.</font>

344
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:54,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they said
they just needed more time.</font>

345
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:57,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time? They destroyed your life.</font>

346
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:01,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much time
before we take revenge?</font>

347
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're my friends.</font>

348
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your only friend.</font>

349
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

350
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,279
