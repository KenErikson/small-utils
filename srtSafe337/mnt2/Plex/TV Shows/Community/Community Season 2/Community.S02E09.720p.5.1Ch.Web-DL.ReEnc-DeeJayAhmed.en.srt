00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:15,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">What appointments?</font>

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wishful thinking.</font>

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called alternative energy,</font>

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">the key to a brighter tomorrow.</font>

6
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Notice all the animals
wearing sunglasses.</font>

7
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's a brighter tomorrow.</font>

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

9
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boys are in elementary school.</font>

10
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:40,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't make nearly
as many dioramas as we do.</font>

11
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:42,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole environmental club
is making them for green week.</font>

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this afternoon in the cafeteria,</font>

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're having a bio-diorama-rama.</font>

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard one kid made a diorama
about a world without dioramas.</font>

15
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still cool if I sleep
at your place tonight, right?</font>

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally. Hey, since we're
both done with classes,</font>

17
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- we can start the sleepover now.
- Let's get in our pajamas</font>

18
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and build a blanket fort.
- Let's do it.</font>

19
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blanket fort. Wow!</font>

20
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can come hang out in it
with us later if you want.</font>

21
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, thanks, but I think
I'll find something</font>

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- more grown-up to do.
- Hmm. Okay.</font>

23
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy eating fiber and
watching The Mentalist.</font>

24
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:11,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta, that wasn't nice.</font>

25
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Shirley,
but who wants to hang out</font>

26
00:01:13,603 --> 00:01:16,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a blanket fort with
grown men in tiny underoos?</font>

27
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:19,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello! So... Jeffrey,</font>

28
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just looking over
your class schedule.</font>

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Uh...</font>

30
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was a random spot-check.</font>

31
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:27,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it was a specific spot-check.</font>

32
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm making a scrapbook.</font>

33
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is</font>

34
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will not be receiving credit
for your independent study:</font>

35
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:37,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conspiracy theories in US history.</font>

36
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why not?</font>

37
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:40,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the class doesn't exist.</font>

38
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:44,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">And neither does the teacher...
Professor Professorson?</font>

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? That's his name!</font>

40
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh...
- It's Dutch.</font>

41
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:50,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think it means professor.
- I think it means poppycock.</font>

42
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ultimate Jeff Winger
blow-off class...</font>

43
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one that doesn't exist.</font>

44
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:57,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I have to audit an
entire system for shenanigans,</font>

45
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means... bye-bye weekends.</font>

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye writing at Starbucks</font>

47
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:04,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">till a certain persian barista
asks me about my novel.</font>

48
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:05,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, Jeff!</font>

49
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one thing to blow off
regular classes,</font>

50
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this devalues all the credits
I work very hard for.</font>

51
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:11,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm.
- Can I defend myself</font>

52
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">and say this is nuts?</font>

53
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:14,861

58
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,087

59
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:26,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then, please... lead me</font>

blow off what happened.</font>

154
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:34,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, especially when not blowing it off</font>

155
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">might cost me my free credit.</font>

156
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, do me a favor.</font>

157
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be very un-Annie and blow it off too.</font>

158
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure. I'll just blow it off.</font>

159
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just blow everything off.</font>

160
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heck, I guess I'll just
blow off walkin'!</font>

161
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- I'll just blow off standing.</font>

162
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just blowin' everything off!</font>

163
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll blow off talking language.</font>

164
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

165
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blee blu blah blah blah
blee blu blu blah...</font>

166
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, bros, what's the ha...</font>

167
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

168
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:08,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet fort!</font>

169
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I come inside?</font>

170
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could, Pavel...</font>

171
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">or... maybe the inside
could come to you.</font>

172
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you characterize</font>

173
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">the amount of blankets
and pillows you have?</font>

174
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">A butt load?</font>

175
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get wicked cold, bros,</font>

176
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">and mad sleepy.</font>

177
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're here to
help me take my diorama</font>

178
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the bio-diorama-rama,
I can do it myself.</font>

179
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You made that clear</font>

180
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your 11th "I can do it myself" text.</font>

181
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You even work too hard
at passive-aggression,</font>

182
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know that?</font>

183
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, so...</font>

184
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you know anything about
greendale's night school?</font>

185
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm assuming it's the worst thing</font>

186
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could ever hope to be in...</font>

187
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:01,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only at night.</font>

188
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Annie.
Have you been playing detective?</font>

189
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are gonna Nancy
screw me out of my credit.</font>

190
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax. All I did was ask
the administration desk</font>

191
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:12,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I could borrow a faculty directory.</font>

192
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look at this.</font>

193
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that Professorson?</font>

194
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">His real name is Professor Woolley,</font>

195
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he actually does
teach night school here.</font>

196
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would someone you've never met</font>

197
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">pretend to be your phony Professor?</font>

198
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:29,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was already carrying
falsified faculty credentials.</font>

199
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what this means?</font>

200
00:08:30,338 --> 00:08:33,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You are making me do work
for my fake conspiracy class!</font>

201
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.
There's a conspiracy here.</font>

202
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dark, vast conspiracy</font>

203
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">that may just go all the way to the top.</font>

204
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:41,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is greendale, Annie.</font>

205
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's a conspiracy,</font>

206
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">it goes all the way to
slightly below the middle.</font>

207
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

208
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's wrong.</font>

209
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">My car won't start.</font>

210
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:51,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on one second.</font>

211
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:53,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

212
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:54,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your little friend</font>

213
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stop snooping around night school,</font>

214
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:59,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">otherwise, things
might get... explosive.</font>

215
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie!</font>

216
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

217
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

218
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably didn't need to tackle you.</font>

219
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably not.</font>

220
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone sent us a message...</font>

221
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tiny, thoroughly
underwhelming message.</font>

222
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you've already
laid out your outfit</font>

223
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:36,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">for tomorrow morning...</font>

224
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we're going to night school.</font>

225
00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:45,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stole these from my son's house.</font>

226
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:49,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">When does a fort stop being a fort?</font>

227
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. As long as it's still
made out of blankets...</font>

228
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:52,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

229
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:55,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">These'll be perfect</font>

230
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the Pierce's mom memorial tunnel.</font>

231
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">How ' bout this one?</font>

232
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's Professor Huyck's class...</font>

233
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">"History of... Something."</font>

234
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:11,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't pronounce it?</font>

235
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It literally says
history of something.</font>

236
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see that.</font>

237
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Principles of Intermediate?</font>

238
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Studyology"? "Class 101"?</font>

239
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this one just says learning</font>

240
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an exclamation point.</font>

241
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Professor Professorson.</font>

242
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or should I say... Woolley?</font>

243
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:38,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">What class are you
teaching tonight, professor?</font>

244
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:39,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Math.</font>

245
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Math?
- Uh-huh.</font>

246
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind if we sit in?</font>

247
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all. Right this way.</font>

248
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what kind of math
do you teach, professor?</font>

249
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know, math.</font>

250
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Numbers.</font>

251
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pi.</font>

252
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">New math. Uh...</font>

253
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

254
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went into that blanket fort!</font>

255
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he went this way!</font>

256
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you see him?
- Oh, sorry.</font>

257
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- Sorry.</font>

258
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Troy! Abed!
- Hey, guys.</font>

259
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Fluffy town.</font>

260
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:23,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">No smoking, no farting,
no pillow fighting.</font>

261
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're in a chase!
- That's allowed.</font>

262
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:27,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is!</font>

263
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Follow us.
- But afterwards,</font>

264
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">you should really check out
our civil rights museum.</font>

265
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, back up!</font>

266
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't even be in here, Leonard.</font>

267
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already have three
farting strikes against you.</font>

268
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">W... He's getting away!</font>

269
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a shortcut.
Through the turkish district.</font>

270
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta?</font>

271
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

272
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:01,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

273
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is!
What the hell's this?</font>

274
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Latvian independence parade.</font>

275
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:13,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me.
They had the proper permits.</font>

276
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:15,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dang it! We lost him!</font>

277
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily, I sent the
diorama car to the chem lab</font>

278
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:19,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have the explosive analyzed.</font>

279
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:21,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that him playing the trejdeksnis?</font>

280
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice try, Woolley!</font>

281
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, tell us everything.</font>

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you?</font>

283
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha ha ha.</font>

284
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you!</font>

285
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

286
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">This, Annie, is night school.</font>

287
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every student, every teacher,
every class...</font>

288
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figments...</font>

289
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Puffs of hot air...</font>

290
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the lips of a ghost</font>

291
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the shadow of a unicorn's dream.</font>

292
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it up.
Night school doesn't exist.</font>

293
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to be a student here
at Greendale like you, Jeff,</font>

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">then one day I invented a
fake course to get a free credit.</font>

295
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">To keep up the lie,
I had to create a fake teacher</font>

296
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">who needed other fake classes</font>

297
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">that needed to be filled
with other fake students,</font>

298
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so on and so on
and so on, "etchethra"!</font>

299
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:16,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just mispronounce et cetera?</font>

300
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Latin class is fake, Jeff...</font>

301
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like all my classes, like my life.</font>

302
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you listening?</font>

303
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I am.</font>

304
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:25,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a very familiar feeling
is starting to come over me.</font>

305
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like someone is

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's ever been learned
in this room is regret!</font>

308
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:35,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would that this desk
were a time desk...</font>

309
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that I could correct
my past mistakes...</font>

Wait a minute.</font>

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unicorns? Ghost lips?
Time desks?</font>

314
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:50,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't any of this
overly stylized garbage</font>

315
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">remind you of anyone?</font>

316
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,197

00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think you do.</font>

321
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, next time you
walk someone to your fake lair,</font>

325
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.
That character was killing me.</font>

326
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:22,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word of advice... If you ever
scrape the dean's car,</font>

327
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't tell him you're gonna
pay him back in acting.</font>

to crash his family dinner</font>

stealing my girlfriend.</font>

330
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:33,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. I guess this did go
all the way to the top.</font>

331
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm calling the dean right now</font>

332
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">and giving him a piece of my mind!</font>

333

337
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. We just did a
modern retelling of MacBeth</font>

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think I'm lazy.</font>

341

<font color="#FFFFFF">Prop guns?</font>

342
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff... What do you have in mind?</font>

343
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little demonstration for the dean</font>

344
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the dangers of trying to educate me.</font>

345
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't like fake classes?</font>

346
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's about to get
a real lesson on the fact</font>

347
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Jeff Winger never learns.</font>

348
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he comes. Get set.</font>

349
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to see me?</font>

350
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:19,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

351
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mr... Professorson.</font>

352
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">His real name is Woolley.</font>

353
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's defrauded your school</font>

354
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a tune of dozens of credits per year</font>

355
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:30,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nearly twice as many dollars.</font>

356
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's serious.</font>

357
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately for you,</font>

358
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a big believer in second chances.</font>

359
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:36,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not.</font>

360
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:39,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

361
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie!</font>

362
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:42,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you... you shot him!</font>

363
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Course I shot him!
He was being dishonest.</font>

364
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if there's one thing
greendale's taught me, it's...</font>

365
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa, what the hell?
- She had a gun!</font>

366
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a fake gun! We staged this</font>

367
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:54,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get back at you for deceiving us!</font>

368
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're the deceiver, Jeffrey!</font>

369
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well, now you're the dead guy.</font>

370
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff! What are you doing?</font>

371
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have a real gun?</font>

372
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you shoot the dean?</font>

373
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, he shot you!
- Not really!</font>

374
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and I were in on this from the start.</font>

375
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:14,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he found out you
were faking a class,</font>

376
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:17,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">he came to me and we cooked
up this whole conspiracy thing</font>

377
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">to illustrate the slippery slope</font>

378
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">of academic fraud!</font>

379
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you
actually illustrated, Annie?</font>

380
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to be a crappy friend.</font>

381
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once it was obvious</font>

382
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dean had orchestrated everything,</font>

383
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was even more obvious</font>

384
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dean was too stupid
to orchestrate anything.</font>

385
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hmm!
- So on a hunch, I called him,</font>

386
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:41,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we hatched a plan to
teach you a lesson or two</font>

387
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">about friendship.</font>

388
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Jeff, I only did it
because I love you.</font>

389
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when you love someone,</font>

390
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to take them as they are.</font>

391
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">People aren't playthings, Annie.</font>

392
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they are not.</font>

393
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who's talking.</font>

394
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:57,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">After everything you've put me through?</font>

395
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:00,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Where'd you get that gun?</font>

396
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:04,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were only three prop guns.</font>

397
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I live in
a terrible neighborhood.</font>

398
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, put the gun down.</font>

399
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">After we kissed,</font>

400
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I waited all summer to see you.</font>

401
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... buried me</font>

402
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a shameful secret.</font>

403
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:17,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

404
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter, Jeff?</font>

405
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Afraid crazy Annie
would go crazy for you?</font>

406
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what.</font>

407
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie's got a gun.</font>

408
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, just put the gun...</font>

409
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:37,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie... What have you done?</font>

410
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you love Jeff winger so much,</font>

411
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">why did you conspire
with me against him?</font>

412
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:43,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know!</font>

413
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't keep track of any of it anymore!</font>

414
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just keep teaming up
with whoever suggests it!</font>

415
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad to hear you admit it.</font>

416
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:55,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I called you to ask you
to double-cross Annie,</font>

417
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't hesitate for a second.</font>

418
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you even understand
what a conspiracy is?</font>

419
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you conspire with every
person that approaches you,</font>

420
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not even really
conspiring with anyone.</font>

421
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just doing random crap.</font>

422
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I...</font>

423
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry! I just...</font>

424
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:11,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna have fun
with you guys and...</font>

425
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go crazy cooped up in
my little office, and...</font>

426
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time travel is really
hard to write about!</font>

427
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohhhh... kay!</font>

428
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm keeping track right,
we should be done.</font>

429
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just take these back
to the theater department.</font>

430
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:31,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Police!
- Aah!</font>

431
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:32,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapons!</font>

432
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Down on the ground!
- Don't shoot, officer!</font>

433
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot, please.
They're fake...</font>

434
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are prop guns!</font>

435
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:43,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

436
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it just goes to show you...</font>

437
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">prop guns belong backstage.</font>

438
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... Scene.</font>

439
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have got to be kidding me!</font>

440
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor garrity called and told me</font>

441
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">what all of you were up to.</font>

442
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made me mad. Guns aren't toys.</font>

443
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">In 100% of all fake gun
related shootings,</font>

444
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">the victim is always the
one with the fake gun.</font>

445
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Sean, you got breakfast plans?</font>

446
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do now.</font>

447
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Sean...</font>

448
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:17,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still on for Thanksgiving, right?</font>

449
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:19,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just talk to your father, Craig.</font>

450
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would that this hoodie
were a time hoodie.</font>

451
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:26,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dean,</font>

452
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">how 'bout that credit?</font>

453
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:29,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aaa</font>

454
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">damn it.</font>

455
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure what lessons</font>

456
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">either of us managed
to teach each other,</font>

457
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,465
