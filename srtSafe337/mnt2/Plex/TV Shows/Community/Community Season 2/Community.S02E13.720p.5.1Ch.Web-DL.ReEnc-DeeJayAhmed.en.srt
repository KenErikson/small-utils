00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:07,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Buzzby, how are you today?</font>

2
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:08,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so great, Bumbleton.</font>

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a ton of pollen to collect,</font>

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm really tired.</font>

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flying a little low?
Maybe you should get high.</font>

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's this?
- This is Drugs.</font>

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.</font>

8
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:21,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzzz.</font>

9
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me honey, honey.</font>

10
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce!</font>

11
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:25,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drugs doesn't say that.</font>

12
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't say anything,
by the way.</font>

13
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I thought this show
was about drug awareness.</font>

14
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:33,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's gonna be aware of a
character that has no lines?</font>

15
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:36,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">And also I noticed on page 15
I get flushed down the toilet.</font>

16
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:37,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider yourself lucky.</font>

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, question.
Is Pierce marijuana?</font>

18
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:42,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">And does marijuana help
people work faster?</font>

19
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it made them just
custom-paint their vans</font>

20
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">and solve mysteries.</font>

21
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, are you sure that
my costume is on backwards?</font>

22
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somehow I felt more
confident before.</font>

23
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:50,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a question.
I don't think my character</font>

24
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">would say "tripping balls."</font>

25
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a question.</font>

26
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:54,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think my character</font>

27
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">would say tripping balls, okay?</font>

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, let's remember
why we're doing this.</font>

29
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:00,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">If our work helps even one
kid make better choices,</font>

30
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">then it will all be worth it.</font>

31
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had seen a show
like this when I was younger.</font>

32
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might have helped
me avoid my mistakes.</font>

33
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're happy to
do this for you, Annie,</font>

34
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have to say, my school
had plenty of shows like this,</font>

35
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I think sitting through
them drove me to drugs.</font>

36
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:14,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't count, Britta.</font>

37
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:16,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't respond to
anything appropriately.</font>

38
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,567

we can get rid of</font>

were you hoping to participate</font>

49
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- in the show?
- Oh, I would love to, Annie.</font>

50
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,472

We're both cute.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe it?</font>

151
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

152
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I wanna help, Annie.</font>

153
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, Pierce.</font>

154
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, now.
- I'm not taking money from you.</font>

155
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not mine. It's yours.</font>

156
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've earned it for being strong.</font>

157
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to drop into your
hands from out of nowhere.</font>

158
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I was never here.</font>

159
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I'm only taking this</font>

160
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm a little
worried about making rent,</font>

161
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they told me the
procedure for selling eggs</font>

162
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">takes three weeks.</font>

163
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">You save your eggs
for a rainy day.</font>

164
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

165
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce?</font>

166
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, why did you
follow me here today?</font>

167
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It was nothing, it...</font>

168
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems sort of pointless now.</font>

169
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess just to
talk about the play</font>

170
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">and... Who cares if I
don't have any lines?</font>

171
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know what, Pierce?</font>

172
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should do that
line you improvised.</font>

173
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Don't call me honey, honey"?
- Yeah, that's it.</font>

174
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should do that.</font>

175
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were the Gerber Baby
of moist towelettes, right?</font>

176
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes, I was.</font>

177
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Action!</font>

178
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.</font>

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">One rainy day, my son Pierce and I</font>

180
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">were taking a stroll
when I discovered</font>

181
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:44,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cleansing power of moist cotton,
fresh from the field.</font>

182
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that right, son?</font>

183
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sure is.</font>

184
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sure is, dad!</font>

185
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, knock it off.</font>

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be in the
commercial too, father.</font>

187
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then you
should have done better</font>

188
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your damn audition.</font>

189
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name, son?</font>

190
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:01,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nigel.</font>

191
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a good boy, Nigel.</font>

192
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father is a lucky man.</font>

193
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, guys, remember,</font>

194
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most important
thing is to have fun!</font>

195
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the second most
important thing</font>

196
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to know all your lines
and all your blocking</font>

197
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:21,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not mess up a single thing.
Actually... flip those.</font>

198
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go, guys.
I took the liberty</font>

199
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">of juicing up some of our bits.</font>

200
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... But...</font>

201
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, you can't just
revise Annie's script.</font>

202
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who uses wite-out anymore?</font>

203
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we look
over Pierce's changes</font>

204
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see if they improve things?</font>

205
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, Crayon, do you know
where I can get some drugs?</font>

206
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need them."</font>

207
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Unfortunately,
you can get them anywhere."</font>

208
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Anywhere?"
- I'm here!</font>

209
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:45,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zabba-da-zooey!</font>

210
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good one.</font>

211
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, doesn't seem
to hurt anything,</font>

212
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let's get into costume
and break a stinger!</font>

213
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the bees.</font>

214
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, uh...</font>

215
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I don't feel comfortable
with the zabba-da-zooey line.</font>

216
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one you wrote?</font>

217
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it!</font>

218
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's give Jeff the
zabba-da-zooey line,</font>

219
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I'll come
in with a good one.</font>

220
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah...
- It's more my voice.</font>

221
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty sure Jeff is
gonna reject that idea.</font>

222
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're probably right.</font>

223
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the producer.</font>

224
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, is this your pen?</font>

225
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... think I put it
back in my pocket</font>

226
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:22,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I wrote you
that check yesterday.</font>

227
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give it to you later.</font>

228
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:26,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll talk to Jeff.</font>

229
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I think it'd be
better for my character</font>

230
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I wear his leather jacket.</font>

231
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:33,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!</font>

232
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Greendale's
Drug Awareness Show!</font>

233
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Our volunteers</font>

234
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:45,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">are handing out drug-free
baseballs, huh?</font>

235
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you think about drugs,</font>

236
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">think about baseball instead.</font>

237
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't ignore me forever.</font>

238
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you probably can...</font>

239
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why you want to.</font>

240
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if I told
you my nephew Marcus</font>

241
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually goes to San
Ramone middle school,</font>

242
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's coming to see the show.</font>

243
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Marcus? Your nephew?
- Yeah, he's 14.</font>

244
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually thought he
didn't even like me,</font>

245
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then he texted me out
of nowhere and he said,</font>

246
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:14,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Can't wait to see you.</font>

247
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I've been looking forward
to this for so long.</font>

248
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:18,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the coolest
aunt in the world."</font>

249
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope that I don't let him down.</font>

250
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You'll be great.
- What does this symbol mean?</font>

251
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a number eight,
an equal sign,</font>

252
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then a greater than symbol.</font>

253
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.</font>

254
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd better get changed.</font>

255
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll hang onto your stuff for you.</font>

256
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

257
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abed, we screwed up.</font>

258
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that text we sent?</font>

259
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was to Britta's nephew.</font>

260
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent her an emoti-penis.</font>

261
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we gonna do?</font>

262
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Screw you, Abed.</font>

263
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can fix this.</font>

264
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Marcus, I made a mistake.</font>

265
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:52,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I texted the wrong
person last night."</font>

266
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You called me by name.
It wasn't a mistake.</font>

267
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid."</font>

268
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you, Abed.</font>

269
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I was drunk. We can't do this."</font>

270
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm drunk too. On lust."</font>

271
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a picture.</font>

272
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! That's disappointing.</font>

273
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, who does that? That's...</font>

274
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bees, you're up.
Cool cats, your on deck.</font>

275
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.</font>

276
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drugs are like special honey.</font>

277
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">They give you a buzzzzzzz.</font>

278
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me "honey," honey.</font>

279
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ignoring me
because I'm Korean?</font>

280
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're Chinese.
- Oh, there's a difference?</font>

281
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!</font>

282
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's because you're crazy,
all right?</font>

283
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something wrong with you.</font>

284
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the idea that I was with you</font>

285
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">means there's something
wrong with me,</font>

286
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if this baby...</font>

287
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have any humanity at all,</font>

288
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,145

me think about it.</font>

289

<font color="#FFFFFF">Shirley, funeral.</font>

290
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:00,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that answers my question.</font>

291

even in a coffin. Mmm!</font>

supposed to be onstage.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you wearing?
This is a funeral.</font>

296
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this, Annie.</font>

297

301
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
that's right, Drugs.</font>

302
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody asked you, Crayon.</font>

303
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh!</font>

304
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:49,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I hope you're
proud of yourself, Drugs.</font>

305
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what you've done.</font>

306
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah? Well,
look what I'm doing now.</font>

307
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smells like something
died in here.</font>

308
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:04,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want us to do?</font>

309
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we get the dean?</font>

310
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we call in a bomb threat?</font>

311
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we set off the sprinklers?</font>

312
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:09,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that big a deal.</font>

313
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the kids are into it.</font>

314
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I don't think that
they're getting the message.</font>

315
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:13,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but do kids
ever really seem</font>

316
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">like they're getting the message?</font>

317
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's sinking in.</font>

318
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess it's your call.</font>

319
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">And anyway, he's about to
get flushed down the toilet</font>

320
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the next scene,
and he'll be done.</font>

321
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had never
even met Drugs.</font>

322
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who invited the
nerd from the beehive?</font>

323
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drugs made you.</font>

324
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you leave, Drugs?</font>

325
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zip, pop, zoom.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoosh!</font>

327
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want more.</font>

328
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go back out there.</font>

329
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Pierce, you were flushed.
That was the story.</font>

330
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what's supposed
to happen to Drugs.</font>

331
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being flushed doesn't
necessarily mean you're dead.</font>

332
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I could be a floater.</font>

333
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a floater is when
you have a number two...</font>

334
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what a floater is,
Pierce.</font>

335
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just... it wouldn't
make any sense</font>

336
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the flow of the show,
and it sends a mixed message.</font>

337
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:09,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think
is a mixed message?</font>

338
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent,
and today you can.</font>

00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Annie.
You and I are alike.</font>

340
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,479

We need each other.</font>

356
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">After intermission, I'm going
back to the original script</font>

357
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:20,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">and doing some damage control.</font>

358
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:21,778

go back on that stage!</font>

362
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe I won't
be visiting you</font>

363
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:32,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">late at night anymore
with a generous spirit.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You sick, sick, sad old man.</font>

365
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why I didn't want to
take money from my parents.</font>

pulling my strings.</font>

Is he giving you money?</font>

368
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

369
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:47,661

script got changed.</font>

370
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce bought his way in.
Annie sold out her message.</font>

indulging this maniac?</font>

372
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:56,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I've been
indulging this maniac.</font>

373

- Fired?</font>

don't even have any.</font>

382
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,192

383
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,703

00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,232

chanting for Drugs,</font>

Charleston Chews, thank God.</font>

388
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:32,033

is all I'm saying.</font>

00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Whoops.</font>

390
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want Drugs!</font>

391
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should we bail?
- Works for me.</font>

392
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:39,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

393
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want Drugs!</font>

394
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to those kids.</font>

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just created 50
potential meth heads,</font>

396
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the least we can do
is hit the reset button</font>

397
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get that number down
to the national average.</font>

398
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a suicide mission.</font>

399
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did someone say crazy person?</font>

400
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:57,669

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but I am!</font>

406
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disappointed?</font>

407
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you expect me to
stay the same forever?</font>

408
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause that's not
what drug does, baby.</font>

409

and eat your mama's face</font>

418
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta tell you, Annie,</font>

419
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is the greatest
chemical dependency program</font>

420
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have ever watched.</font>

421
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the way you got the kids</font>

422
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">to think that they needed Drugs,</font>

423
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then having them realize</font>

424
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">that dependence was the enemy,</font>

425
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the price was just too high.</font>

426
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, genius.</font>

these bee costumes?</font>

430
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Marcus. I'm Jeff.</font>

431
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.</font>

432
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, dude,
she started it, okay?</font>

433
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's just as into me.
- No, listen, listen.</font>

434
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:15,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not mad.</font>

435
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just fooling around,</font>

436
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I sent those texts.</font>

437
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gross.
- Yeah.</font>

438
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:21,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was pretty disgusting,</font>

439
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">sending those
pictures to your aunt.</font>

440
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">More disgusting
than what you texted</font>

441
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">to an underage boy?</font>

442
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well,
I didn't know you were you.</font>

443
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I didn't know
you weren't my aunt.</font>

444
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:28,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right,</font>

445
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's just call this a draw.</font>

446
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britta doesn't need to
ever know about this.</font>

447
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'd be happy to,
for a price.</font>

448
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was brave of you.</font>

449
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you an apology.</font>

450
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was rude to call you crazy.</font>

451
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I haven't been
giving you enough credit.</font>

452
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's really sweet.
Tell you what.</font>

453
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't I go get Chang?
You can tell him that yourself.</font>

454
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, no.
- My God, that was amazing!</font>

455
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,451

- Amazing!</font>

457
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way to go, man,
go! That was awesome.</font>

458
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">They beat the crap out of you.</font>

459
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
I did a lot of ad-libbing.</font>

460
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I'm so sorry.</font>

461
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much.
That was amazing.</font>

462
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even I learned something.</font>

463
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Annie.
- We did it.</font>

464
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Group hug, group hug.
- Hug, hug.</font>

465
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:21,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Way to save the day.
- Nice work.</font>

466
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get hit in the
face with a baseball?</font>

467
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

468
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, before you say anything,</font>

469
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want you to know,</font>

470
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:30,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though I did nothing wrong,</font>

471
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still gonna give you money.</font>

472
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I can't take
your money, Pierce.</font>

473
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't go from
depending on my parents</font>

474
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">to depending on you,</font>

475
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I'm gonna get a job.</font>

476
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're cutting me off?</font>

477
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

478
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:45,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce, I know you
don't depend on anyone,</font>

479
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:47,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you do depend on
people depending on you,</font>

480
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm not gonna take your money.</font>

481
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still friends?</font>

482
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:52,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a day.</font>

483
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way,</font>

484
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:57,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">your mom was the
Period Fairy, right?</font>

485
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, I found my phone,</font>

486
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">but has anyone seen my bra?</font>

487
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,961

for President's Day.</font>

491
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kidding.</font>

492
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dildopolis never closes.</font>
