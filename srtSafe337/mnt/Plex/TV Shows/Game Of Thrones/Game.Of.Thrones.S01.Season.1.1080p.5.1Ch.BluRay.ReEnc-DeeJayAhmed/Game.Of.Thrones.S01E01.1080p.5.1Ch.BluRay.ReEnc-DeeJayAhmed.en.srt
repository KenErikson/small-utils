00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, boy.</font>

2
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you expect?
They're savages.</font>

3
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">One lot steals a goat from another lot,</font>

4
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.</font>

5
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.</font>

6
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.</font>

7
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">How close did you get?</font>

8
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.</font>

9
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the dead frighten you?</font>

10
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our orders were to track the wildlings.</font>

11
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.</font>

12
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think he'll ask us how they died?</font>

13
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back on your horse.</font>

14
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.</font>

15
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">They even killed the children.</font>

16
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good thing we're not children.</font>

17
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to run away south,
run away.</font>

18
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.</font>

19
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I don't catch you first.</font>

20
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back on your horse.</font>

21
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't say it again.</font>

22
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.</font>

23
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were here.</font>

24
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">See where they went.</font>

25
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

26
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...</font>

27
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Father's watching.</font>

28
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your mother.</font>

29
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine work, as always.
Well done.</font>

30
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

31
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.</font>

32
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite beautiful.</font>

33
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stitching...</font>

34
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...</font>

35
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.</font>

36
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?</font>

37
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep practicing, Bran.</font>

38
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

39
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think too much, Bran.</font>

40
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax your bow arm.</font>

41
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.</font>

42
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark!</font>

43
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

44
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guardsman just rode in from the hills.</font>

45
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.</font>

46
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the lads to saddle their horses.</font>

47
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have to?</font>

48
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He swore an oath, Cat.</font>

49
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Law is law, my lady.</font>

50
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Bran he's coming too.</font>

51
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned.</font>

52
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten is too young
to see such things.</font>

53
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't be a boy forever.</font>

54
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">And winter is coming.</font>

55
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good lad, go run back and get the rest.</font>

56
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">White walkers.</font>

57
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the white walkers.</font>

58
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">White walkers.</font>

59
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">The white walkers, I saw them.</font>

60
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I broke my oath.</font>

61
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know I'm a deserter.</font>

62
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...</font>

63
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw what I saw.</font>

64
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the white walkers.</font>

65
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">People need to know.</font>

66
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you can get word to my family...</font>

67
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell them I'm no coward.</font>

68
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them I'm sorry.</font>

69
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Lord.</font>

70
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You did well.</font>

78
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand why I did it?</font>

79
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon said he was a deserter.</font>

80
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">But do you understand
why I had to kill him?</font>

81
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Our way is the old way"?</font>

82
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:36,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.</font>

83
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true he saw the white walkers?</font>

84
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.</font>

85
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he was lying?</font>

86
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A madman sees what he sees.</font>

87
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

88
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mountain lion?</font>

89
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no mountain lions
in these woods.</font>

90
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a freak.</font>

91
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a direwolf.</font>

92
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tough old beast.</font>

93
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.</font>

94
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there are five.</font>

95
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to hold it?</font>

96
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where will they go?</font>

97
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their mother's dead.</font>

98
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't belong down here.</font>

99
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.</font>

100
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right. Give it here.
- No!</font>

101
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,759

104
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark?</font>

105
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are five pups.</font>

106
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for each of the Stark children.</font>

107

<font color="#FFFFFF">The direwolf is the sigil of your house.</font>

108
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were meant to have them.</font>

109
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will train them yourselves.</font>

110
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will feed them yourselves.</font>

111
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.</font>

112
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

113
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a Stark.</font>

114
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on.</font>

115
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

116
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.</font>

117
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...</font>

118

until you told Father.</font>

a new Hand of the King,</font>

fucking boars and hunting whores.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You can always say no, Ned.</font>

155
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.</font>

156
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.</font>

157
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...</font>

158
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">stature?</font>

159
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.</font>

160
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we'll find out.</font>

161
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">In any case, candles.</font>

162
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?</font>

163
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.</font>

164
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the prince is a right royal prick.</font>

165
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.</font>

166
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:59,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Tommy, shear him good.</font>

167
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.</font>

168
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, but they grow fast.</font>

169
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brandon!</font>

170
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.</font>

171
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times have I told you?
No climbing.</font>

172
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's coming right now, down our road.</font>

173
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to promise me,</font>

174
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">no more climbing.</font>

175
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

176
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know what?
- What?</font>

177
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always look at your feet
before you lie.</font>

178
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run and find your father.</font>

179
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him the king is close.</font>

180
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?</font>

181
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.</font>

182
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing with that on?</font>

183
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

184
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

185
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace.</font>

186
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got fat.</font>

187
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cat!
- Your Grace.</font>

188
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?</font>

189
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.</font>

190
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the lmp?
- Will you shut up?</font>

191
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who have we here?</font>

192
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Robb.</font>

193
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">My, you're a pretty one.</font>

194
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name is?</font>

195
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya.</font>

196
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, show us your muscles.</font>

197
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be a soldier.</font>

198
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.</font>

199
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:06,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please shut up?</font>

200
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">My queen.</font>

201
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">My queen.</font>

202
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.</font>

203
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:23,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been riding for a month, my love.</font>

204
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely the dead can wait.</font>

205
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned.</font>

206
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the lmp?</font>

207
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is our brother?</font>

208
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:46,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go and find the little beast.</font>

209
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about Jon Arryn.</font>

210
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">One minute he was fine and then...</font>

211
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">burned right through him,
whatever it was.</font>

212
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved that man.</font>

213
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both did.</font>

214
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:06,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?</font>

215
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I wanted to do</font>

216
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">was crack skulls and fuck girls.</font>

217
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.</font>

218
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.</font>

219
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you, Ned,</font>

220
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.</font>

221
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:31,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Eddard Stark...</font>

222
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would name you the Hand of the King.</font>

223
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not worthy of the honor.</font>

224
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not trying to honor you.</font>

225
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom</font>

226
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.</font>

227
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Ned, stand up.</font>

228
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You helped me win the Iron Throne,</font>

229
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">now help me keep the damn thing.</font>

230
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were meant to rule together.</font>

231
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:03,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">if your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.</font>

232
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not too late.</font>

233
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a son,
you have a daughter.</font>

234
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll join our houses.</font>

235
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true what they say
about the northern girls.</font>

236
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?</font>

237
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did hear something about that.</font>

238
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the queen and her twin brother.</font>

239
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

240
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the other brother?</font>

241
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...</font>

242
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's the clever one.</font>

243
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm...</font>

244
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear they call him the lmp.</font>

245
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he hates that nickname.</font>

246
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.</font>

247
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he's a drunken little lecher,</font>

248
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">prone to all manner of perversions.</font>

249
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clever girl.</font>

250
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.</font>

251
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you?</font>

252
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Already?
- Oh!</font>

253
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods gave me one blessing.</font>

254
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't get up.
- My lord.</font>

255
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?</font>

256
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have much to teach me, no doubt,</font>

257
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">but our sister craves your attention.</font>

258
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has odd cravings, our sister.</font>

259
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">A family trait.</font>

260
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.</font>

261
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.</font>

262
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is the first of many courses.</font>

263
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might say that.</font>

264
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">But since we're short on time...</font>

265
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, girls.</font>

266
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at sundown.</font>

267
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close the door!</font>

268
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?</font>

269
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">She should be on a hill somewhere</font>

270
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the sun and the clouds above her.</font>

271
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was my sister.</font>

272
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where she belongs.</font>

273
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">She belonged with me.</font>

274
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my dreams,
I kill him every night.</font>

275
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.</font>

276
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all of them.</font>

277
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys!</font>

278
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys.</font>

279
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's our bride-to-be.</font>

280
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, a gift from lllyrio.</font>

281
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Touch it.</font>

282
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, feel the fabric.</font>

283
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:51,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

284
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't he a gracious host?</font>

285
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.</font>

286
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">lllyrio's no fool.</font>

287
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows I won't forget my friends</font>

288
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I come into my throne.</font>

289
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still slouch.</font>

290
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them see.</font>

291
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a woman's body now.</font>

292
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to be perfect today.</font>

293
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do that for me?</font>

294
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?</font>

295
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

296
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,</font>

297
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will say it began today.</font>

298
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too hot, my lady.</font>

299
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

300
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.</font>

301
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I present my honored guests?</font>

302
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viserys of House Targaryen,</font>

303
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">the third of his name,</font>

304
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,</font>

305
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his sister,</font>

306
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:35,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys of House Targaryen.</font>

307
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see how long his hair is?</font>

308
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Dothraki are defeated in combat</font>

309
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.</font>

310
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo has never been defeated.</font>

311
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.</font>

312
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will be his queen.</font>

313
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come forward, my dear.</font>

314
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he going?</font>

315
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.</font>

316
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he like her?</font>

317
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.</font>

318
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't be long now.</font>

319
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.</font>

320
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people drink secret toasts

322
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will they be married?</font>

323
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.</font>

324
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true they lie with their horses?</font>

325
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.</font>

326
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you take me for a fool?</font>

327
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take you for a king.</font>

328
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kings lack the caution
of common men.</font>

329
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">My apologies if I've given offense.</font>

330
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:35,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to play a man like Drogo.</font>

331
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:38,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.</font>

332
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be his queen.</font>

333
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to go home.</font>

334
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do l.</font>

335
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want us both to go home,</font>

336
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they took it from us.</font>

337
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:57,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me, sweet sister,</font>

338
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">how do we go home?</font>

339
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

340
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go home with an army.</font>

341
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Khal Drogo's army.</font>

342
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:14,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would let his whole tribe fuck you,</font>

343
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">all 40,000 men and their horses too,</font>

344
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">if that's what it took.</font>

345
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think Joffrey will like me?</font>

346
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:41,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he thinks I'm ugly?</font>

347
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.</font>

348
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's so handsome.</font>

349
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?</font>

350
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.</font>

351
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:57,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he say no?</font>

352
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.</font>

353
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd have to leave home.</font>

354
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd have to leave me.</font>

355
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so would you.</font>

356
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left your home to come here.</font>

357
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd be queen someday.</font>

358
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please make Father say yes!</font>

359
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sansa...
- Please, please!</font>

360
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only thing I ever wanted.</font>

361
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.</font>

362
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

363
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here, you little beauty!</font>

364
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:00,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he dead yet?</font>

365
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uncle Benjen.</font>

366
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got bigger.</font>

367
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rode all day.</font>

368
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.</font>

369
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you at the feast?</font>

370
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:21,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family</font>

371
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">to seat a bastard in their midst.</font>

372
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.</font>

373
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.</font>

374
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">So take me with you
when you go back.</font>

375
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.</font>

376
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he will.</font>

377
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Wall isn't going anywhere.</font>

378
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready to swear your oath.</font>

379
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:46,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.</font>

380
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:48,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no families.</font>

381
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:52,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.</font>

382
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might, if you knew what it meant.</font>

383
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd better get inside,</font>

384
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">rescue your father from his guests.</font>

385
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll talk later.</font>

386
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.</font>

387
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing back there?</font>

388
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Preparing for a night with your family.</font>

389
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wanted to see the Wall.</font>

390
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Tyrion Lannister,</font>

391
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">the queen's brother?</font>

392
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">My greatest accomplishment.</font>

393
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?</font>

394
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I offend you? Sorry.</font>

395
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the bastard, though.</font>

396
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</font>

397
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Lady Stark is not your mother,</font>

398
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">making you... the bastard.</font>

399
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:09,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me give you some advice, bastard.</font>

400
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never forget what you are.</font>

401
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of the world will not.</font>

402
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wear it like armor...</font>

403
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it can never be used to hurt you.</font>

404
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?</font>

405
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.</font>

406
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You at a feast...</font>

407
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like a bear in a trap.</font>

408
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy I beheaded...</font>

409
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.</font>

410
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he was tough, Ned,</font>

411
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">a true ranger.</font>

412
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was talking madness.</font>

413
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.</font>

414
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two he was with are still missing.</font>

415
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmph. A wildling ambush.</font>

416
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

417
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Direwolves south of the Wall,</font>

418
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">talk of the walkers,</font>

419
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.</font>

420
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winter is coming.</font>

421
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winter is coming.</font>

422
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.</font>

423
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you?
- I'm good.</font>

424
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:50,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?</font>

425
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:53,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Lovely country.</font>

426
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.</font>

427
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:06,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.</font>

428
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, little dove.</font>

429
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are a beauty.</font>

430
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.</font>

431
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:18,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're tall. Still growing?</font>

432
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so, Your Grace.</font>

433
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And have you bled yet?</font>

434
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Your Grace.</font>

435
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dress, did you make it?</font>

436
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:37,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such talent.
You must make something for me.</font>

437
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.</font>

438
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the same.</font>

439
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your daughter will do well in the capital.</font>

440
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.</font>

441
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.</font>

442
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:13,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.</font>

443
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.</font>

444
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be good
to have you on the field.</font>

445
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">The competition has become a bit stale.</font>

446
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?</font>

447
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting a little old for it?</font>

448
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:29,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't fight in tournaments</font>

449
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:32,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">because when I fight a man for real,</font>

450
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:34,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want him to know what I can do.</font>

451
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:37,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well said.</font>

452
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

453
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not funny!</font>

454
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">She always does this.</font>
