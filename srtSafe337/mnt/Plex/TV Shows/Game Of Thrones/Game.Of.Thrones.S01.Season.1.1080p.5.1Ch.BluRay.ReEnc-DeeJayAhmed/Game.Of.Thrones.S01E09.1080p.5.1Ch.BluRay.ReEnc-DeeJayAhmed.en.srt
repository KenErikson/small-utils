1
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen better days, my lord.</font>

2
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another visit?</font>

3
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems you're my last friend.</font>

4
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, many still love you.</font>

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.</font>

6
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">On her knees begging for me. Hm!</font>

7
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you laugh with the others?</font>

8
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.</font>

9
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you want.</font>

10
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've given up trying to guess.</font>

11
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was still a boy -</font>

12
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -</font>

13
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.</font>

14
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">They taught me that
each man has a role to play.</font>

15
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same is true at court.</font>

16
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the master of whisperers.</font>

17
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.</font>

18
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a good actor, my lord.</font>

19
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Can you free me from this pit?</font>

20
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could.</font>

21
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">But will l?</font>

22
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

23
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I said, I'm no hero.</font>

24
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want? Tell me.</font>

25
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?</font>

26
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace.</font>

27
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:34,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.</font>

28
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fighting for his father's freedom.</font>

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robb?</font>

30
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a boy.</font>

31
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys have been conquerors before.</font>

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.</font>

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.</font>

34
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.</font>

35
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:01,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.</font>

36
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.</font>

37
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei is no fool.</font>

38
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.</font>

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,</font>

40
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">who crippled my son?</font>

41
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to serve the realm!</font>

42
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,</font>

43
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell your son to lay down his sword</font>

44
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.</font>

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cersei knows you as a man of honor.</font>

46
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,</font>

47
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe she will allow you
to take the black</font>

48
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.</font>

49
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think my life
is some precious thing to me?</font>

50
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...</font>

51
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of what?</font>

52
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You grew up with actors.</font>

53
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learned their craft and you learnt it well.</font>

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I grew up with soldiers.</font>

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned how to die a long time ago.</font>

56
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity.</font>

57
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a pity.</font>

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of your daughter's life, my lord?</font>

59
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a precious thing to you?</font>

60
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.</font>

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.</font>

62
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.</font>

63
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:30,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?</font>

64
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.</font>

65
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

66
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father rots in a dungeon.</font>

67
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long before they take his head?</font>

68
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.</font>

69
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.</font>

70
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.</font>

71
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.</font>

72
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,</font>

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.</font>

74
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have my horse saddled and ready.</font>

75
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.</font>

76
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.</font>

77
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.</font>

78
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it took.</font>

79
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.</font>

80
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree.</font>

81
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go.
- You can't!</font>

82
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.</font>

83
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless there was a profit in it.</font>

84
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

85
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.</font>

86
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, spare me.</font>

87
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.</font>

88
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I supposed to do with you?</font>

89
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...</font>

90
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?</font>

91
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?</font>

92
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.</font>

93
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you come forward.</font>

94
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,</font>

95
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.</font>

96
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls there somewhere we can talk?</font>

97
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking right now.</font>

98
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

99
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out! All of you!</font>

100
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- You too.</font>

101
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see that?</font>

102
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifteen, she is.</font>

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little flower.</font>

104
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And her honey's all mine.</font>

105
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure she will give you many sons.</font>

106
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.</font>

107
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is quite ill, my lord.</font>

108
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.</font>

109
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the one before that.</font>

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your family has always pissed on me.</font>

111
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:46,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.</font>

112
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.</font>

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.</font>

114
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?</font>

115
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?</font>

116
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">To ask you...</font>

117
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">to open your gates, my lord...</font>

118
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.</font>

119
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why should I let him?
- if you could climb your own battlements,</font>

120
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.</font>

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.</font>

122
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.</font>

123
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep</font>

124
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.</font>

125
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore an oath to my father.</font>

126
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, I said some words.</font>

127
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.</font>

128
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey's king now,</font>

129
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:49,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.</font>

130
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.</font>

131
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.</font>

132
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?</font>

133
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... engage!</font>

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?</font>

135
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Soon, he says.
- Good.</font>

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be ready for this, then.</font>

137
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...</font>

138
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.</font>

139
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.</font>

140
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:45,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Valyrian steel.</font>

141
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my father's sword,
his father before him.</font>

142
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.</font>

143
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was meant for my son Jorah.</font>

144
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:03,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">He brought dishonor to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword</font>

145
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he fled from Westeros.</font>

146
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My lord, you honor me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.</font>

147
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will.</font>

148
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.</font>

149
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bloody dead man tried to kill me.</font>

150
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.</font>

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.</font>

152
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

153
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.</font>

154
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.</font>

155
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.</font>

156
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.</font>

157
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...</font>

158
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...</font>

159
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">boy king.</font>

160
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should get young Joffrey's attention.</font>

161
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.</font>

162
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...</font>

163
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring me my supper.</font>

164
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

165
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well done.
- Well done.</font>

166
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You earned that, Snow.</font>

167
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done.</font>

168
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, let's have a look.</font>

169
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:42,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.</font>

170
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!</font>

171
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!</font>

172
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.</font>

173
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.</font>

174
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it here!</font>

175
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

176
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- l...
- Look at its eyes.</font>

177
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give it.
- I can't.</font>

178
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't what?</font>

179
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:16,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">l...</font>

180
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really not supposed to say.</font>

181
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet you really want to say.</font>

182
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to say that...?</font>

183
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a raven.</font>

184
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read the message to Maester Aemon.</font>

185
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your brother Robb.</font>

186
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about him?</font>

188
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's heading south.</font>

189
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">To war.</font>

190
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.</font>

191
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be there.</font>

192
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be with him.</font>

193
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we do that, they'll never get back across.</font>

194
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

195
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

196
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Walder has granted your crossing.</font>

197
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His men are yours, as well.
- Huh.</font>

198
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.</font>

199
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he want in return?</font>

200
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.</font>

201
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.</font>

202
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

203
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Arya...</font>

204
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.</font>

205
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.</font>

206
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

207
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

208
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the fighting is done...</font>

209
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will marry one of his daughters.</font>

210
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:15,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whichever you prefer.</font>

211
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a number
he thinks will be... suitable.</font>

212
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

213
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:24,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get a look at his daughters?</font>

214
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

215
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

216
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">One was...</font>

217
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you consent?</font>

218
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.</font>

219
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I consent.</font>

220
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam said you wanted to see me?</font>

221
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did indeed.</font>

222
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.</font>

223
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch</font>

224
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">take no wives and father no children?</font>

225
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

226
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they will not love.</font>

227
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love is the death of duty.</font>

228
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...</font>

229
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">between honor on the one hand...</font>

230
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:10,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those he loves on the other,</font>

231
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would he do?</font>

232
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.</font>

233
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.</font>

234
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of us are not so strong.</font>

235
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is honor...</font>

236
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">compared to a woman's love?</font>

237
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is duty...</font>

238
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?</font>

239
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a brother's smile?</font>

240
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam told you.</font>

241
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all human.</font>

242
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.</font>

243
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honor comes easy then.</font>

244
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet...</font>

245
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">sooner or later...</font>

246
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">in every man's life...</font>

247
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:01,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">there comes a day when it is not easy.</font>

248
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A day when he must choose.</font>

249
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is my day?</font>

250
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you're saying?</font>

251
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.</font>

252
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- You do not know.</font>

253
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one knows.</font>

254
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be a bastard,</font>

255
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he is my father and Robb is my brother.</font>

256
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:35,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.</font>

257
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">They waited till I was old.</font>

258
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...</font>

259
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?</font>

260
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was helpless...</font>

261
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">blind, frail.</font>

262
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

263
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...</font>

264
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his poor son...</font>

265
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the children!</font>

266
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the little children.</font>

267
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

268
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was Maekar,</font>

269
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first of his name.</font>

270
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother Aegon reigned after him...</font>

271
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I had refused the throne.</font>

272
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was followed by his son Aerys...</font>

273
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">whom they called the Mad King.</font>

274
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Aemon Targaryen.</font>

275
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a maester of the Citadel,</font>

276
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.</font>

277
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not tell you... to stay or go.</font>

278
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must make that choice yourself...</font>

279
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">and live with it for the rest of your days.</font>

280
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I have.</font>

281
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord...</font>

282
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sun and stars...</font>

283
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drogo.</font>

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">My horse...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood of my blood...</font>

286
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:47,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I must ride.</font>

287
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">He fell from his horse.</font>

288
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.</font>

289
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:58,349

290
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.</font>

291
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no place to camp.</font>

292
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.</font>

293
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.</font>

294
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:15,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not command me, Khaleesi.</font>

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.</font>

296
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.</font>

297
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.</font>

298
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah! Hyah!</font>

299
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:59,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins</font>

300
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Lord Frey's levies in tow.</font>

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're a day's march north.</font>

302
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy may lack experience and sense,</font>

303
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he does have a certain mindless...</font>

304
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- provincial courage.
- Ah.</font>

305
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.</font>

306
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,</font>

307
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.</font>

308
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.</font>

309
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavy black steel, double-sided.</font>

310
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shagga likes axes.</font>

311
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.</font>

312
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.</font>

313
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?</font>

314
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do seem rather ferocious.</font>

315
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ferocious?</font>

316
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.</font>

317
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.</font>

318
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,</font>

319
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">which was fortunate, but even still,
Ulf is demanding blood money,</font>

320
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.</font>

321
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:09,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.</font>

322
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.</font>

323
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be no more discussion on the matter.</font>

324
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">It appears I'm not hungry after all.</font>

325
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, my lords.</font>

326
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?</font>

327
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I took her.
- Took her?</font>

328
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- From whom?
- From, uh...</font>

329
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser... What's his name?</font>

330
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:54,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?</font>

331
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said something.</font>

332
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.</font>

333
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.</font>

334
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well.</font>

335
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">l, uh...
think I'll go and find myself one.</font>

336
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

337
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would you like me to be?</font>

338
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did your mother call you?</font>

339
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shae. What did your mother call you?</font>

340
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother died giving birth to me.</font>

341
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?</font>

342
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.</font>

343
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">For...</font>

344
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me?</font>

345
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I want from you?</font>

346
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to share my tent.</font>

347
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,</font>

348
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.</font>

349
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.</font>

350
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.</font>

351
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which it may well be.</font>

352
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do I get?</font>

353
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">One - safety.</font>

354
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.</font>

355
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:20,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two - the pleasure of my company,</font>

356
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I have heard is spectacular.</font>

357
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who told you this?
Women you paid?</font>

358
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And three...</font>

359
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.</font>

360
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you accept my proposal?</font>

361
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's start with your last night in this world.</font>

362
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi.</font>

363
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

364
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's very strong.</font>

365
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one understands how strong he is.</font>

366
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.</font>

367
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't. I won't let him.</font>

368
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even a queen doesn't have that power.</font>

369
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.</font>

370
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.</font>

371
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doth...</font>

372
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if...</font>

373
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if he dies...</font>

374
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">why would I run?</font>

375
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.</font>

376
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood.</font>

377
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.</font>

378
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.</font>

379
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't want any rivals.</font>

380
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.</font>

381
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't... leave him.</font>

382
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:07,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wound has festered.</font>

383
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did this, witch.</font>

384
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

385
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want her hurt.</font>

386
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:19,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? No?
You don't want her hurt?</font>

387
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:27,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.</font>

388
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.</font>

389
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only while the blood of my blood lives.</font>

390
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he dies, she is nothing.</font>

391
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.</font>

392
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.</font>

393
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.</font>

394
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're right.</font>

395
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.</font>

396
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's beyond the healer's skills.</font>

397
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I can do is ease his path.</font>

398
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save him and I will free you. I swear it.</font>

399
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must know a way.</font>

400
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some...</font>

401
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some magic.</font>

402
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a spell.</font>

403
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some would say death is cleaner.</font>

404
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:55,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

405
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:58,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save him.</font>

406
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.</font>

407
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.</font>

408
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only death pays for life.</font>

409
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">My death?</font>

410
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not your death, Khaleesi.</font>

411
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:17,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me his horse.</font>

412
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:42,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi, do not do this thing.</font>

413
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.</font>

414
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:49,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.</font>

415
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.</font>

416
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Now.</font>

417
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.</font>

418
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take her!</font>

419
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.</font>

420
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dead will dance here tonight.</font>

421
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will enter.</font>

422
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him back to me.</font>

423
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

424
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to save him.</font>

425
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.</font>

426
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have been safe.</font>

427
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must not be.</font>

428
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:23,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must be.</font>

429
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witch.</font>

430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't.</font>

431
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi!</font>

432
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">No further, horselord.</font>

433
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you hurt?</font>

434
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The baby...
- Hmm?</font>

435
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. is coming.</font>

436
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.</font>

437
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll come or I'll have their heads.</font>

438
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.</font>

439
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you in agony, my lion?</font>

440
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You look like you're in agony.</font>

441
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.</font>

442
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

443
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:12,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?</font>

444
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just used to it.
- Drink.</font>

445
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's play a new game.</font>

446
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.</font>

447
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:26,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?</font>

448
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not if you win.
- No!</font>

449
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fire games, no knife games.</font>

450
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?</font>

451
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I happen to be a great judge of character.</font>

452
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.</font>

453
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.</font>

454
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:48,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I'm right, you drink.
if I'm wrong, I drink.</font>

455
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.</font>

456
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to play this game.</font>

457
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Bronn first.</font>

458
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father beat you.</font>

459
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my mother hit harder.</font>

460
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed your first man
before you were 12.</font>

461
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a woman.</font>

462
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">She swung an axe at me.</font>

463
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:25,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been north of the Wall.</font>

464
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">What brought you up there?</font>

465
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Work.
- And...</font>

466
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly</font>

467
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you've never let yourself love again.</font>

468
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, that's me.</font>

469
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.</font>

470
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to play.</font>

471
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:55,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.</font>

472
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother was a whore.</font>

473
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

474
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

475
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:15,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.</font>

476
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

477
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!</font>

478
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm.</font>

479
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:29,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted a different life.</font>

480
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.</font>

481
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.</font>

482
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, specifics...</font>

483
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?</font>

484
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.</font>

485
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... what's a lowborn girl to do?</font>

486
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink.</font>

487
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure...
- Drink!</font>

488
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,</font>

489
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I will carve your eyes from your head.</font>

490
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologize.</font>

491
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">My turn.</font>

492
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, fine.</font>

493
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask away.</font>

494
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.</font>

495
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.</font>

496
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care the way the game works.</font>

497
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our lord here used to be married.</font>

498
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Married?
- How did you hear that?</font>

499
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.</font>

500
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another night, perhaps.</font>

501
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not another night. This night.</font>

502
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a pleasant story.</font>

503
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, maybe I will cry.</font>

504
00:38:55,949 --> 00:39:00,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.</font>

505
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

506
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.</font>

507
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:18,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.</font>

508
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.</font>

509
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was too scared to send off on her own,</font>

510
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:30,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.</font>

511
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name was Tysha.</font>

512
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a wheelwright's orphan.</font>

513
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:37,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she was hungry.</font>

514
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.</font>

515
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">lmpossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.</font>

516
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot how afraid I was around girls...</font>

517
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...</font>

518
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">look away embarrassed,</font>

519
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.</font>

520
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot about everything but Tysha.</font>

521
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And somehow I found myself in her bed.</font>

522
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:05,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">For three chickens, I should hope so.</font>

523
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.</font>

524
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she was good to me.</font>

525
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">She kissed me afterwards and...</font>

526
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:15,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">sang me a song.</font>

527
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.</font>

528
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon</font>

529
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there you have it - man and wife.</font>

530
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.</font>

531
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.</font>

532
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not quite.</font>

533
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.</font>

534
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl was a whore, you see.</font>

535
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers... all of it.</font>

536
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thought it was time I had a woman.</font>

537
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">After my brother confessed...</font>

538
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">my father brought in my wife</font>

539
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gave her to his guards.</font>

540
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">He paid her well -
a silver for each man.</font>

541
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many whores command
that kind of price?</font>

542
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.</font>

543
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the end, she had so much silver</font>

544
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.</font>

545
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have killed the man
who did that to me.</font>

546
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have known she was a whore.</font>

547
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

548
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 16, drunk and in love.</font>

549
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.</font>

550
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I said, I was young and stupid.</font>

551
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are still young and stupid.</font>

552
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah!</font>

553
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.</font>

554
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.</font>

555
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're a mile north.</font>

556
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.</font>

557
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I die, weep for me.</font>

558
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be dead.
How will you know?</font>

559
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll know.</font>

560
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out! Move!</font>

561
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of the way!</font>

562
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move aside!</font>

563
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay low.</font>

564
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay low?</font>

565
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:26,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're lucky, no one will notice you.</font>

566
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:28,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born lucky.</font>

567
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tribesmen of the Vale,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dominion over the Vale begins now!</font>

574
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:53,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Onward, to claim what is yours!</font>

575
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half man! Half man!</font>

576
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:58,840

578
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">To battle!</font>

579
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:47,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a shit warrior.</font>

580
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm alive?</font>

581
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're alive.</font>

582
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we win?</font>

583
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.</font>

584
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did our tribesmen do?</font>

585
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, good.</font>

586
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:29,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to see them getting along.
You're wounded.</font>

587
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good of you to notice.</font>

588
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear we won.</font>

589
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh! The scouts were wrong.</font>

590
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.</font>

591
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we get the Stark boy, at least?</font>

592
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't here.</font>

593
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was he?</font>

00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">With his other 18,000 men.</font>

595
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where are they?</font>

596
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should go, my lady.
- No!</font>

597
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:15,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady!</font>

598
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:19,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah! Hyah!</font>

599
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:55,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.</font>

600
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.</font>

601
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not your sword I want.</font>

602
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me my daughters back.</font>

603
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me my husband.</font>

604
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lost them too, I'm afraid.</font>

605
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:14,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.</font>

606
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:19,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.</font>

607
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:22,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him away and put him in irons.</font>

608
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:25,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could end this war right now, boy,</font>

609
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">save thousands of lives.</font>

610
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.</font>

611
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swords or lances, teeth, nails -</font>

612
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.</font>

613
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we do it your way, Kingslayer...</font>

614
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd win.</font>

615
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not doing it your way.</font>

616
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, pretty man.</font>

617
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.</font>

618
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. But the dead won't hear them.</font>

619
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:19,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">One victory does not make us conquerors.</font>

620
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we free my father?</font>

621
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?</font>

622
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?</font>

623
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war is far from over.</font>

624
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I have one?</font>

625
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lemon one... or any of them.</font>

626
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three coppers.</font>

627
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.</font>

628
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?</font>

629
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piss off!</font>

630
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?</font>

631
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?</font>

632
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hand of the King.</font>

633
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Traitor!
- Coward!</font>

634
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baelor.</font>

636
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitor! Traitor!</font>

637
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Eddard Stark...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">in the sight of gods and men.</font>

642
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I betrayed the faith of my king...</font>

643
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the trust of my friend Robert.</font>

644
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swore to protect and defend his children.</font>

645
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">But before his blood was cold...</font>

646
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I plotted to murder his son...</font>

647
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seize the throne for myself.</font>

648
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...</font>

00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">so do we suffer.</font>

656
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:50,659

661
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:10,219

with this traitor, Your Grace?</font>

662
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.</font>

663

he would serve the realm in permanent exile.</font>

has begged mercy for her father.</font>
