Send a raven and put an end to it.</font>

30
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,639

This is what matters -</font>

I want you to stay.</font>

And if you ever take it off again,</font>

60
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,059

They've already started the war.</font>

when your father can't.</font>

71

You some kind of cripple?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Not today."</font>

154
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has to eat the whole heart?</font>

155
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope that wasn't my horse.</font>

156
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's doing well.</font>

157
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll never keep it down.</font>

158
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,509

what they gave to her in that tent. Never.</font>

192
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,319

193
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I carry
what I need to carry without it? Hmm?</font>

194
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,779

195
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.</font>

196
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think I see you
looking at my little sister, hmm?</font>

197
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think I know what you want?</font>

198

<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care. You can have her.</font>

199

and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,</font>

on whichever parts of her you like.</font>

201
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let me go.</font>

202
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go.</font>

203
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't have the eggs.</font>

204
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You swore an oath to me.</font>

205
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does loyalty mean nothing to you?</font>

206
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means everything to me.</font>

207
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet here you stand.</font>

208

218
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:29,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">is an abstract concept...</font>

219
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they captured me, they took my purse,
but the gold is still mine.</font>

220
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

221
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where? I don't know where,
but when they free me...</font>

222
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want free?</font>

223
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,859

224
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,319

226
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you have!</font>

227
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a smart man.</font>

228
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who the Lannisters are.</font>

229
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,630

you have also heard the phrase,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"a Lannister always pays his debts."</font>

233

237
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,029

which I very much intend to do.</font>

238
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What message?</font>

239
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.</font>

240
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wish to confess your crimes?</font>

241
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.</font>

00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet your gods as an honest man.</font>

245
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?</font>

246
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a vile man, I confess it.</font>

247
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">My crimes and sins are beyond counting.</font>

248
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have lied and cheated...</font>

249
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">gambled and whored.</font>

250
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not particularly good at violence, but...</font>

251
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:43,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.</font>

252
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want specifics, I suppose.</font>

253
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was seven, I saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.</font>

254
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stole her robe.</font>

255
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.</font>

256
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:04,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I close my eyes,
I can still see her tits bouncing.</font>

257
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 10,
I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit.</font>

258
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">When confronted with my crime,
I blamed a squire.</font>

259
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor boy was flogged and...
I escaped justice.</font>

260
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 12 I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.</font>

261
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:27,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I flogged the one-eyed snake.</font>

262
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:29,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I skinned my sausage.</font>

263
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,</font>

264
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I do believe my sister ate.</font>

265
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least I hope she did.</font>

266
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

268
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened next?</font>

269
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think you're doing?</font>

270
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confessing my crimes.</font>

271
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:56,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,</font>

272

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm very sorry.</font>

275
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know anything about all that.</font>

276
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've had your little joke.</font>

277
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you enjoyed it.</font>

278
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:17,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mord, take him back to the dungeon.</font>

279
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.</font>

280
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this howjustice is done in the Vale?</font>

281
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You accuse me of crimes,</font>

282
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:30,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deny them,</font>

283
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?</font>

284
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the king's justice?</font>

285
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am accused and demand a trial!</font>

286
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.</font>

287
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand the law.</font>

288
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no executioner in the Eyrie.</font>

289

<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the Moon Door.</font>

291
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.</font>

292
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

293
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will hear his judgment.</font>

295
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,559

<font color="#FFFFFF">For the love I bore your lord husband...</font>

304
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">let me avenge his death.</font>

305
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honor.</font>

306
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!</font>

307
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Vardis...</font>

308
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're quiet.</font>

309
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to avenge my husband?</font>

310
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:21,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all my heart, my lady.</font>

311
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the lmp is half my size.</font>

312
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.</font>

313
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed.</font>

314
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You demanded a trial by combat.</font>

315
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.</font>

316
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady,</font>

317
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will gladly fight the lmp's champion for you.</font>

318
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be too glad, ser.</font>

319
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.</font>

320
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.</font>

321
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.</font>

322
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:55,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trial will be today.</font>

323
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I have a volunteer?</font>

324
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone?</font>

325
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone?</font>

326
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we can assume that no one is willing...</font>

327
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stand for the dwarf.</font>

328
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">More wine, Your Grace?</font>

329
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:38,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was I saying?
- Simpler time.</font>

330
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.</font>

331
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?</font>

332
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,</font>

333
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.</font>

334
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing like today.</font>

335
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:56,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.</font>

336
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.</font>

337
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:08,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?</font>

338
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once. I think.</font>

339
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think? I think you'd remember.</font>

340
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back in our day, you weren't a real man</font>

341
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms</font>

342
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Riverlands.</font>

343
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.</font>

344
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever make the eight, Barristan?</font>

345
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe so, Your Grace.</font>

346
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were the days.</font>

347
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which days, exactly?</font>

348
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?</font>

349
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies</font>

350
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?</font>

351
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?</font>

352
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, boy.</font>

353
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.</font>

354
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it was all rather heroic.</font>

355
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore</font>

356
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.</font>

357
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">More wine, Your Grace?</font>

358
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -</font>

359
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">our fields, our granaries,</font>

360
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">our homes.</font>

361
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took our women,
then they took 'em again.</font>

362
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.</font>

363
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">They covered our children in pitch...</font>

364
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lit them on fire.</font>

365
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brigands, most likely.</font>

366
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:53,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.</font>

367
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">They even left something behind, Your Grace.</font>

368
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.</font>

369
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king is hunting.</font>

370
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fish. The sigil of House Tully.</font>

371
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?</font>

372
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men, were they flying a sigil?</font>

373
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.</font>

374
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one who was leading them...</font>

375
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,</font>

376
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:40,039

377
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,000

with a single swing of his sword.</font>

378
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like someone we know.</font>

379
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mountain.</font>

380
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.</font>

381
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?</font>

382
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man is an anointed knight.</font>

383
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.</font>

384
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you have as well.</font>

385
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have</font>

on villages under the king's protection,</font>

- That would be almost as brazen</font>

389
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

452
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:40,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?</font>

453
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:46,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.</font>

454
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just realized... l don't care.</font>

455
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sansa...
- Septa.</font>

456
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you are being rude.</font>

457
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">My prince.</font>

458
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">My prince.</font>

459
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

460
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear I have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.</font>

461
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">With your permission?</font>

462
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful,</font>

463
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the one your mother wears.</font>

464
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be queen someday.</font>

465
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only fitting you should look the part.</font>

466
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you forgive me for my rudeness?</font>

467
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing to forgive.</font>

468
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my lady.</font>

469
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day we'll be married
in the throne room.</font>

470
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,</font>

471
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the last hearth in the North</font>

472
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the salt shore in the South.</font>

473
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:10,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will be queen over all of them.</font>

474
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never disrespect you again.</font>

475
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never be cruel to you again.</font>

476
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:22,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand me?</font>

477
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my lady now...</font>

478
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:28,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">from this day...</font>

479
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">until my last day.</font>

480
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

481
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop!
- Whoa.</font>

482
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.</font>

483
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a turnip cart?</font>

484
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.</font>

485
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can afford that?</font>

486
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of my friends
are more generous than others.</font>

487
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.</font>

488
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'll have lots of company.</font>

489
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:20,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you'll be very popular...</font>

490
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:24,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick</font>

491
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.</font>

492
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what will happen to me if I stay here?</font>

493
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I become Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron lslands?</font>

494
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:34,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be a fool.</font>

495
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.</font>

496
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:42,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon</font>

497
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">and most of them will never come back.</font>

498
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing left for me here.</font>

499
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, Steffon.</font>

500
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giddy up.</font>

501
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see it one more time!</font>

502
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">See what?</font>

503
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:09,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to miss you!</font>

504
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

505
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.</font>

506
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Listen...</font>

507
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?</font>

508
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.</font>

509
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.</font>

510
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got my lessons with Syrio.
I'm finally getting good.</font>

511
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a punishment. I want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.</font>

512
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:45,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we take Syrio back with us?</font>

513
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:48,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can't go.</font>

514
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his queen</font>

515
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.</font>

516
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:59,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're old enough, I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,</font>

517
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...</font>

518
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!</font>

519
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,</font>

520
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.</font>

521
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lion's not his sigil, idiot.</font>

522
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a stag, like his father.</font>

523
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:18,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.</font>

524
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.</font>

525
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait!
- Come on.</font>

526
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not fair!</font>

527
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."</font>

528

<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys!</font>

535
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my sister?</font>

536
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop him.</font>

537
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:16,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she? Hmm?</font>

538
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:21,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.</font>

539
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whore's feast?</font>

540
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come.
- Get your hands off me!</font>

541
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one touches the dragon!</font>

542
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo!</font>

543
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for the feast.</font>

544
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.</font>

545
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:52,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back there.</font>

546
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:56,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is no place for a king.</font>

547
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:59,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no king.</font>

548
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep away from me!</font>

549
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viserys, please.</font>

550
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is.</font>

551
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.</font>

552
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't kill us.</font>

553
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't shed blood in their sacred city.</font>

554
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can.</font>

555
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want what I came for.</font>

556
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the crown he promised me.</font>

557
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">He bought you.</font>

558
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he never paid for you.</font>

559
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back.</font>

560
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:03,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can keep the baby.</font>

561
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll cut it out and leave it for him.</font>

562
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he saying?</font>

563
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says yes.</font>

564
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shall have a golden crown...</font>

565
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. that men shall tremble to behold.</font>

566
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:47,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was all I wanted.</font>

567
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-What was promised.</font>

568
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

569

I am the dragon!</font>

571
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want my crown! Ahh!</font>

572
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.</font>

573
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dany.</font>

574
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dany, tell them.</font>

575
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make them!</font>

576
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dany, make them...</font>

577
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you can't!</font>

578
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... Please!</font>

579
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dany, please!</font>

580
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:06,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">A crown for a king.</font>

581
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi?</font>

582
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,869
