1
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, Lord Stark.</font>

2
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.</font>

3
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The honor of your presence is requested.</font>

4
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.</font>

5
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.</font>

6
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...</font>

7
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank the gods you're here, Stark.</font>

8
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">About time we had
some stern northern leadership.</font>

9
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad to see you're protecting the throne.</font>

10
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sturdy old thing.</font>

11
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?</font>

12
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, what's the line?</font>

13
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king shits and the Hand wipes.</font>

14
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very handsome armor.</font>

15
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.</font>

16
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.</font>

17
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've chosen your opponents wisely then.</font>

18
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a knack for it.</font>

19
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.</font>

20
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was standing right here
when it happened.</font>

21
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was very brave, your brother.</font>

22
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father, too.</font>

23
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't deserve to die like that.</font>

24
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody deserves to die like that.</font>

25
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you just stood there and watched.</font>

26
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">500 men just stood there and watched.</font>

27
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

28
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?</font>

29
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Lord Stark.</font>

30
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.</font>

31
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for the screams, of course,</font>

32
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Mad King laughing.</font>

33
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">And later...</font>

34
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I watched the Mad King die,</font>

35
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...</font>

36
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It felt like justice.</font>

37
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you tell yourself at night?</font>

38
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a servant ofjustice?</font>

39
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?</font>

40
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:59,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,</font>

41
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you admire me more?</font>

42
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You served him well...
when serving was safe.</font>

43
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark.</font>

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Varys.</font>

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.</font>

46
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.</font>

47
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:37,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.</font>

48
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly! You're looking well.</font>

49
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you look tired from the road.</font>

50
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...</font>

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have a kingdom
to look after.</font>

52
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.</font>

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.</font>

54
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.</font>

55
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...</font>

56
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">from navel to collarbone.</font>

57
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.</font>

58
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.</font>

59
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:10,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Catelyn Tully.</font>

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.</font>

61
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.</font>

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grand Maester.</font>

63
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many years has it been?</font>

64
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.</font>

65
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how forgetful of me.</font>

66
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">This belongs to you now.</font>

67
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we begin?</font>

68
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,</font>

69
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:44,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.</font>

70
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Grace has many cares.</font>

71
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.</font>

72
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the lords of small matters here.</font>

73
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament</font>

74
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.</font>

75
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,</font>

76
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">20,000 to the runner-up,</font>

77
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">20,000 to the winning archer.</font>

78
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can the treasury bear such expense?</font>

79
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, I expect.</font>

80
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?</font>

81
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?</font>

82
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?</font>

83
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.</font>

84
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.</font>

85
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,</font>

86
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.</font>

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Counting coppers," he calls it.</font>

88
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll speak to him tomorrow.</font>

89
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.</font>

90
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.</font>

91
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.</font>

92
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, my lords. I'm...</font>

93
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.</font>

94
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We serve at your pleasure.</font>

95
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.</font>

96
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.</font>

97
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.</font>

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.</font>

99
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.</font>

100
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true. You killed the beast.</font>

101
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.</font>

102
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't, l...</font>

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.</font>

104
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.</font>

105
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I have to marry her?</font>

106
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

107
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's very beautiful and young.</font>

108
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions</font>

109
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:09,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.</font>

110
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.</font>

111
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.</font>

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.</font>

113
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do something nice for the Stark girl.</font>

114
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.</font>

115
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.</font>

116
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We allow the northerners too much power.</font>

117
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">They consider themselves our equals.</font>

118
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you handle them?</font>

119
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.</font>

120
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">A royal army?</font>

121
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should every lord
command his own men?</font>

122
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.</font>

123
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,</font>

124
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">trained by experienced soldiers,</font>

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.</font>

126
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the northerners rebel?</font>

127
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd crush them.</font>

128
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.</font>

129
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uncle Kevan, maybe.</font>

130
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?</font>

131
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.</font>

132
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've just invaded their homeland,</font>

133
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.</font>

134
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.</font>

135
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too big and too wild.</font>

136
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together</font>

137
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">couldn't save you and your royal army.</font>

138
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good king knows
when to save his strength...</font>

139
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when to destroy his enemies.</font>

140
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you agree...</font>

141
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Starks are enemies?</font>

142
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.</font>

143
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.</font>

144
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?</font>

145
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The prince.
- Arya, stop!</font>

146
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.</font>

147
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound killed your friend.</font>

148
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.</font>

149
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,</font>

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mycah would be alive.</font>

151
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

152
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening here?</font>

153
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.</font>

154
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to your room. We'll speak later.</font>

155
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's for you, love.</font>

156
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.</font>

157
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you like it?</font>

158
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.</font>

159
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.</font>

160
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. Go on.</font>

161
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">War was easier than daughters.</font>

162
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away!</font>

163
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya, open the door.</font>

164
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I come in?</font>

165
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.</font>

166
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

167
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.</font>

168
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get this?</font>

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no toy.</font>

170
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.</font>

171
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't want to be a lady.</font>

172
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

173
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what do you want with this?</font>

174
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called Needle.</font>

175
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a blade with a name.</font>

176
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?</font>

177
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister?</font>

178
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?</font>

179
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stick 'em with the pointy end.</font>

180
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the essence of it.</font>

181
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to learn.</font>

182
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked Mycah to practice with me.</font>

183
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked him. It was my fault.</font>

184
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.</font>

185
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate them. I hate all of them.</font>

186
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound, the queen and the king</font>

187
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Joffrey and Sansa.</font>

188
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...</font>

189
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">and asked to call the prince a liar.</font>

190
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">So was l! He is a liar.</font>

191
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh, darling, listen to me.</font>

192
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.</font>

193
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">She cannot betray him.</font>

194
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must take his side
even when he's wrong.</font>

195
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how you can let her
marry someone like that?</font>

196
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

197
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

198
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.</font>

199
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winter is coming.</font>

200
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.</font>

201
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now winter is truly coming.</font>

202
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,</font>

203
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">look after one another.</font>

204
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa is your sister.</font>

205
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hate her.</font>

206
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.</font>

207
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.</font>

208
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come to a dangerous place.</font>

209
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.</font>

210
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

211
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. It's yours.</font>

212
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can keep it?</font>

213
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try not to stab your sister with it.</font>

214
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.</font>

215
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.</font>

216
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.</font>

217
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a story about a boy who hated stories.</font>

218
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.</font>

219
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were always your favorites.</font>

220
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those weren't my favorites.</font>

221
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">My favorites were the scary ones.</font>

222
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?</font>

223
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear is for the winter,</font>

224
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:30,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.</font>

225
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years</font>

226
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.</font>

227
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the time for fear, my little lord,</font>

228
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the white walkers
move through the woods.</font>

229
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.</font>

230
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kings froze to death in their castles,</font>

231
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">same as the shepherds in their huts.</font>

232
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,</font>

233
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:08,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.</font>

234
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is this the sort of story that you like?</font>

235
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.</font>

236
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">They swept through cities and kingdoms,</font>

237
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">riding their dead horses,</font>

238
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...</font>

239
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you telling him now?</font>

240
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only what the little lord wants to hear.</font>

241
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your supper. I want some time with him.</font>

242
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">One time she told me</font>

243
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye</font>

244
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.</font>

245
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we do.</font>

246
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you feel?</font>

247
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still don't remember anything?</font>

248
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.</font>

249
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the wind, in the rain...</font>

250
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">A thousand times.</font>

251
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You never fall.
- I did though.</font>

252
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true, isn't it,</font>

253
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">what Maester Luwin says about my legs?</font>

254
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather be dead.</font>

255
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.</font>

256
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fewer eyes back here, my lady.</font>

257
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">But still too many.</font>

258
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.</font>

259
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.</font>

260
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

261
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?</font>

262
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would. We've done nothing wrong.</font>

263
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.</font>

264
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">lnstructed?</font>

265
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...</font>

266
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:28,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me, Lady Stark.</font>

267
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:40,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cat!</font>

268
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. Go upstairs.</font>

269
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little worm!</font>

270
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...</font>

271
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pssst!</font>

272
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:03,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.</font>

273
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?</font>

274
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will come looking for you here.
isn't that what you wanted?</font>

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm truly sorry... about the locale.</font>

276
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?</font>

277
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dear friend told me.</font>

278
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.</font>

279
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.</font>

280
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your poor hands.</font>

281
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know I was coming?</font>

282
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowledge is my trade, my lady.</font>

283
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?</font>

284
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little birds are everywhere...</font>

285
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">even in the North.</font>

286
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">They whisper to me
the strangest stories.</font>

287
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valyrian steel.</font>

288
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know whose dagger this is?</font>

289
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must admit I do not.</font>

290
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, this is an historic day.</font>

291
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:11,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you don't know that I do.</font>

292
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

293
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's mine.
- Yours?</font>

294
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:26,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.</font>

295
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,</font>

296
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">as any sane man would.</font>

297
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.</font>

298
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">To whom?</font>

299
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyrion Lannister.</font>

300
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lmp.</font>

301
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.</font>

302
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">if that were a real sword, you'd be dead.</font>

303
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.</font>

304
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:01,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyp.</font>

305
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?</font>

306
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next!</font>

307
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next!</font>

308
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.</font>

309
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go clean yourselves up!</font>

310
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.</font>

311
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">A charming man.</font>

312
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need him to be charming.</font>

313
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways</font>

314
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">into men of the Night's Watch.</font>

315
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?</font>

316
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly.</font>

317
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.</font>

318
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:17,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news or bad?</font>

319
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both.</font>

320
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark.</font>

321
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:26,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant...
to give you this earlier.</font>

322
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">So forgetful these days.</font>

323
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">A raven from Winterfell this morning.</font>

324
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news?</font>

325
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.</font>

326
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:59,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?</font>

327
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'm looking at you.</font>

328
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that she'd be safest in here.</font>

329
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of several such
establishments I own.</font>

330
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a funny man.</font>

331
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? A very funny man.</font>

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned!</font>

333
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the Starks...</font>

334
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:39,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick tempers, slow minds.</font>

335
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke my nose, bastard!</font>

336
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:56,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an improvement.</font>

337
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:02,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.</font>

338
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.</font>

339
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking at, halfman?</font>

340
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at you.</font>

341
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You've got an interesting face.</font>

342
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, very distinctive faces.</font>

343
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you.</font>

344
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do you care about our faces?</font>

345
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just...</font>

346
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they would look marvelous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.</font>

347
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.</font>

348
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll talk later, Lord Snow.</font>

349
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.</font>

350
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one but you.</font>

351
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.</font>

352
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grenn's father left him too...</font>

353
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside a farmhouse, when he was three.</font>

354
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.</font>

355
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.</font>

356
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.</font>

357
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.</font>

358
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">They hate me because
I'm better than they are.</font>

359
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.</font>

360
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword</font>

361
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they came here.</font>

362
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

363
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother Bran.</font>

364
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's woken up.</font>

365
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy</font>

366
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be considered treason.</font>

367
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have proof. We have the blade.</font>

368
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.</font>

369
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,</font>

370
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">thanks to your boy's wolf.</font>

371
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.</font>

372
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.</font>

373
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.</font>

374
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fool's task, admittedly,</font>

375
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.</font>

376
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't forget this.</font>

377
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a true friend.</font>

378
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.</font>

379
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.</font>

380
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:26,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a child. Ten years old.</font>

381
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.</font>

382
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.</font>

383
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.</font>

384
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what are you raving about?</font>

385
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:41,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it comes back to him?
if he tells his father what he saw...</font>

386
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.</font>

387
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.</font>

388
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.</font>

389
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can write a ballad about us -</font>

390
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The War For Cersei's Cunt."</font>

391
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me go.
- Never.</font>

392
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.</font>

393
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he does, I'll kill him.</font>

394
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:13,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,</font>

395
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you and I are the only people
left in this world.</font>

396
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could see the girls.</font>

397
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.</font>

398
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until we know who our enemies are.</font>

399
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.</font>

400
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my bones, I know it.</font>

401
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Littlefinger's right.</font>

402
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do anything without proof.</font>

403
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you find the proof?</font>

404
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I bring it to Robert...</font>

405
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hope he's still the man I once knew.</font>

406
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You watch yourself on the road, huh?</font>

407
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.</font>

408
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">My temper?</font>

409
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.</font>

410
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">He still loves you.</font>

411
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he?</font>

412
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off with you.</font>

413
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it's been a long time.</font>

414
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I still remember every face.</font>

415
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember your first?</font>

416
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Your Grace.</font>

417
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was it?</font>

418
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Tyroshi.</font>

419
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.</font>

420
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you do it?</font>

421
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lance through the heart.</font>

422
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick one.</font>

423
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky for you.</font>

424
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.</font>

425
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.</font>

426
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,</font>

427
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.</font>

428
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knocked him down with the hammer.</font>

429
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, I was strong then.</font>

430
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caved in his breastplate.</font>

431
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably shattered every rib he had.</font>

432
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stood over him, hammer in the air.</font>

433
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait."</font>

434
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.</font>

435
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:37,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't put that part in the songs.</font>

436
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid boy.</font>

437
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.</font>

438
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:53,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,</font>

439
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and today his wife would
be making him miserable,</font>

440
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">his sons would be ingrates,</font>

441
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.</font>

442
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wine!</font>

443
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:13,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.</font>

444
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lancel Lannister.</font>

445
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:22,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?</font>

446
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

447
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?</font>

448
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?</font>

449
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">So get more.</font>

450
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your cousin to get in here.</font>

451
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingslayer! Get in here.</font>

452
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surrounded by Lannisters.</font>

453
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair</font>

454
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their smug, satisfied faces.</font>

455
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must wound your pride, huh?</font>

456
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standing out there like a glorified sentry.</font>

457
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...</font>

458
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:24,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.</font>

459
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">So come on.</font>

460
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're telling war stories.</font>

461
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:34,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?</font>

462
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.</font>

463
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was there that day.</font>

464
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:44,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were only a squire, 16 years old.</font>

465
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.</font>

466
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best move I ever saw.</font>

467
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.</font>

468
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:56,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your outlaw...</font>

469
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">any last words?</font>

470
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.</font>

471
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Aerys Targaryen?</font>

472
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?</font>

473
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never asked.</font>

474
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he call you a traitor?</font>

475
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he plead for a reprieve?</font>

476
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...</font>

477
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Burn them all."</font>

478
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">if that's all, Your Grace...</font>

479
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?</font>

480
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki don't believe in money.</font>

481
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.</font>

482
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">From whom?</font>

483
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -</font>

484
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">pay tribute or fight.</font>

485
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">An easy choice for most.</font>

486
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, sometimes it's not enough.</font>

487
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:27,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.</font>

488
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:29,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.</font>

489
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:33,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months</font>

490
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and need the practice.</font>

491
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them all to stop.</font>

492
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?</font>

493
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until I command them otherwise.</font>

494
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:51,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're learning to talk like a queen.</font>

495
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a queen.</font>

496
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">A khaleesi.</font>

497
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dare!</font>

498
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give commands to me? To me?</font>

499
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

500
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?</font>

501
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.</font>

502
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

503
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.</font>

504
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please, don't hurt him.</font>

505
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:14,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.</font>

506
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:20,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

507
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!</font>

508
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:39,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your king!</font>

509
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?</font>

510
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh uh uh uh uh.</font>

511
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... walk.</font>

512
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.</font>

513
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?</font>

514
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the First Ranger.</font>

515
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">My job is out there.</font>

516
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:03,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?</font>

517
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind I don't want to believe.</font>

518
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready. I won't let you down.</font>

519
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going.</font>

520
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no ranger, Jon.</font>

521
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!</font>

522
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:26,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here...</font>

523
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man gets what he earns,</font>

524
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he earns it.</font>

525
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll speak when I return.</font>

526
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?</font>

527
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,</font>

528
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">all fried in his own fat.</font>

529
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall</font>

530
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.</font>

531
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do a bear's balls taste?</font>

532
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit chewy.</font>

533
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?</font>

534
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do Dornish girls count?</font>

535
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves</font>

536
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bring them here as eager recruits?</font>

537
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

538
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.</font>

539
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.</font>

540
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.</font>

541
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.</font>

542
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?</font>

543
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army ofjesters in black?</font>

544
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have enough men
to be an army</font>

545
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:02,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.</font>

546
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell</font>

547
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're back in King's Landing.</font>

548
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,</font>

549
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:13,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">enjoying your brothels.</font>

550
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.</font>

551
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,</font>

552
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">might be sickness,</font>

553
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:26,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">might just be the cold.</font>

554
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">They die in pain.</font>

555
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they do it...</font>

556
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.</font>

557
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I'm plump?</font>

558
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:47,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.</font>

559
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:50,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.</font>

560
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.</font>

561
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.</font>

562
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, my brother once told me...</font>

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.</font>

564
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

565
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers</font>

566
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:09,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">are lurking beyond the Wall.</font>

567
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:13,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings</font>

568
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened</font>

569
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">to live on the right side of it.</font>

570
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

571
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wildlings are no different from us.</font>

572
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:27,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little rougher maybe.</font>

573
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're made of meat and bone.</font>

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.</font>

575
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.</font>

576
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.</font>

577
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going below?</font>

578
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.</font>

579
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:54,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I always do.</font>

580
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's starting to like me.</font>

581
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Going below"?
- Aye.</font>

582
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">lnto the tunnel and out the other side.</font>

583
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.</font>

584
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.</font>

585
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, day after tomorrow.</font>

586
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.</font>

587
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:34,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.</font>

588
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">l, er...</font>

589
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.</font>

590
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.</font>

591
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one turns away a Lannister.</font>

592
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Khaleesi.</font>

593
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what are you doing?</font>

594
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?</font>

595
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You change, Khaleesi.</font>

596
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a blessing from the Great Stallion</font>

597
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,</font>

598
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:30,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">easier to handle.</font>

599
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.</font>

600
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:38,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a man in full plate...</font>

601
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. the arakh won't get through the steel.</font>

602
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.</font>

603
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Designed for piercing plate.</font>

604
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.</font>

605
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armor.
Armor.</font>

606
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armor make a man, erm...</font>

607
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:59,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slow.</font>

608
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.</font>

609
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father taught me how to fight.</font>

610
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">He taught me that speed defeats size.</font>

611
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.</font>

612
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.</font>

613
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?</font>

614
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He still is.</font>

615
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man of great honor</font>

616
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I betrayed him.</font>

617
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Khaleesi wants
to eat something different tonight.</font>

618
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill some rabbits.</font>

619
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no rabbits.</font>

620
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:44,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find some ducks, she likes ducks.</font>

621
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.</font>

622
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?</font>

623
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.</font>

624
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think she wants to eat dog.</font>

625
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The khaleesi have baby inside her.</font>

626
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.</font>

627
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her belly start to swell.</font>

628
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blessing from the Great Stallion.</font>

629
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">She does not want to eat horse.</font>

630
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.</font>

631
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to ride to Qohor.</font>

632
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:33,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.</font>

633
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. I'll catch you.</font>

634
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:38,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horde's easy to find.</font>

635
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.</font>

636
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:01,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except for you. You move too much.</font>

637
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:04,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.</font>

638
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?</font>

639
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight. No, nine.</font>

640
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of them brief?</font>

641
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:21,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.</font>

642
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">This summer has lasted nine.</font>

643
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:28,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.</font>

644
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks are always right eventually -</font>

645
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">winter is coming.</font>

646
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one will be long...</font>

647
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and dark things will come with it.</font>

648
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.</font>

649
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're fleeing south.</font>

650
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:49,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.</font>

651
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.</font>

652
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.</font>

653
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.</font>

654
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm</font>

655
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what lies beyond.</font>

656
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.</font>

657
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are less than a thousand of us now.</font>

658
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't man the other castles on the Wall.</font>

659
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:23,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't properly patrol the wilderness.</font>

660
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.</font>

661
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister sits by the side of the king.</font>

662
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her... we need help.</font>

663
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:41,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.</font>

664
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:05,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a boy.</font>

665
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

666
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

667
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.</font>

668
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's either me or this cold,</font>

669
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.</font>

670
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?</font>

671
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect I will.</font>

672
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:05,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.</font>

673
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:07,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you see my brother Bran,</font>

674
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell him I miss him.</font>

675
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him I'd visit if I could.</font>

676
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:13,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

677
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never walk again.</font>

678
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:20,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.</font>

679
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take care, Snow.</font>

680
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:24,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farewell, my lord.</font>

681
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are late, boy.</font>

682
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow you will be here at midday.</font>

683
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

684
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:49,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.</font>

685
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow you will catch it.</font>

686
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now pick it up.</font>

687
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not the way, boy.</font>

688
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.</font>

689
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be</font>

690
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make you strong.</font>

691
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so.</font>

692
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:17,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hand is all that is needed.</font>

693
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you are standing all wrong.</font>

694
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn your body sideface.</font>

695
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

696
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">So.</font>

697
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are skinny. That is good.</font>

698
00:53:30,829 --> 00:53:32,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">The target is smaller.</font>

699
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the grip - let me see.</font>

700
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:37,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

701
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">The grip must be delicate.</font>

702
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I drop it?</font>

703
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">The steel must be part of your arm.</font>

704
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you drop part of your arm? No.</font>

705
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.</font>

706
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:55,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.</font>

707
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a girl.</font>

708
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:03,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.</font>

709
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the grip.</font>

710
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...</font>

711
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">A needle.</font>

712
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahhh.</font>

713
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so.</font>

714
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:19,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we will begin the dance.</font>

715
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, child,</font>

716
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...</font>

717
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.</font>

718
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Braavos dance...</font>

719
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">the water dance.</font>

720
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is swift...</font>

721
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sudden.</font>

722
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">All men are made of water.</font>

723
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know this?</font>

724
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you pierce them,</font>

725
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">the water leaks out and they die.</font>

726
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:55,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you will try to strike me.</font>

727
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

728
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up!</font>

729
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

730
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:30,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

731
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:35,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

732
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:36,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

733
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

734
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hup!</font>

735
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very dead.</font>

736
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

737
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah ah ah!</font>

738
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hup!</font>

739
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:54,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, faster.</font>

740
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>
