"kingslayer" behind your back,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't it bother you?</font>

25
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it bothers me.</font>

32
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home</font>

33
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">and remind her that Lannisters</font>

00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">pay their debts.</font>

35
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't realize you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">And every day that he remains a prisoner,</font>

00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">the less our name commands respect.</font>

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">if another house
can seize one of our own</font>

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hold him captive with impunity,</font>

44
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are no longer a house to be feared.</font>

45
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother's dead.</font>

46
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before long I'll be dead.</font>

47
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you...</font>

00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your brother
and your sister</font>

all of us rotting in the ground.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the family name that lives on.</font>

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all that lives on.</font>

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not your personal glory,
not your honor,</font>

54
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">but family.</font>

55
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

56
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

57
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.</font>

58
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:31,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.</font>

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're still blessed with youth.</font>

60
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?</font>

61
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -</font>

62
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">one a madman,
the other a drunk.</font>

63
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.</font>

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.</font>

65
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.</font>

66
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.</font>

67
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not next year. Not tomorrow.</font>

68
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

69
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in pain.</font>

70
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had worse, my lady.</font>

71
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps it's time to go home.</font>

72
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.</font>

73
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.</font>

74
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you, Lord Stark?</font>

75
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?</font>

76
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he done this before?</font>

77
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.</font>

78
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother...</font>

79
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">or your lover?</font>

80
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years</font>

81
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep bloodlines pure.</font>

82
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.</font>

83
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shared a womb.</font>

84
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We came into this world together.
We belong together.</font>

85
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son saw you with him.</font>

86
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you love your children?</font>

87
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.</font>

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And they're all Jaime's.
- Thank the gods.</font>

89
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,</font>

90
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finish him off in other ways.</font>

91
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.</font>

92
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hated him? I worshipped him.</font>

93
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.</font>

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,</font>

95
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">lean and fierce and black-bearded,</font>

96
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was the happiest moment of my life.</font>

97
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,</font>

98
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">and did what he did,
what little he could do,</font>

99
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna."</font>

100
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl</font>

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he loved her more than me.</font>

102
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.</font>

103
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be gone by then -
you and your children.</font>

104
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not have
their blood on my hands.</font>

105
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go as far away as you can,</font>

106
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">with as many men as you can.</font>

107
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because wherever you go,</font>

108
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert's wrath will follow you.</font>

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?</font>

110
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have taken the realm for yourself.</font>

111
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.</font>

112
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.</font>

113
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.</font>

114
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a sad mistake.</font>

115
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made many mistakes in my life...</font>

116
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that wasn't one of them.</font>

117
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but it was.</font>

118
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you play the game of thrones,
you win...</font>

119
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you die.</font>

120
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no middle ground.</font>

121
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

122
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes! Oh, yes!</font>

123
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

124
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!</font>

125
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!</font>

126
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes! Oh, yes!</font>

127
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

128
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no!</font>

129
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what they teach you
up in the North?</font>

130
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you -
wherever you're from -</font>

131
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?</font>

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?</font>

133
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

134
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's start over, shall we?</font>

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You be the man...</font>

136
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you be the woman.</font>

137
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, go ahead.</font>

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly.</font>

139
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.</font>

140
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know what you are.</font>

141
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know it's all just an act.</font>

142
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your job is to make them
forget what they know.</font>

143
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:18,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that takes time.</font>

144
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to...</font>

145
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">ease into it.</font>

146
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

147
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ease into it.</font>

148
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.</font>

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're starting to like this.</font>

150
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to believe you.</font>

151
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?</font>

152
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows he's better
than other men.</font>

153
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:58,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.</font>

154
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's so good,</font>

155
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,</font>

156
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">overcoming your very nature.</font>

157
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you join us, my lord?</font>

158
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saving myself for another.</font>

159
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What she doesn't know won't hurt her.</font>

160
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stupid saying.</font>

161
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.</font>

162
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must be very beautiful.</font>

163
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not really.
lmpeccable bloodlines though.</font>

164
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do believe my lord's in love.</font>

165
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">For many years.
Most of my life, really.</font>

166
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Play with her arse.</font>

167
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she loved me too.</font>

168
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was her little confidant, her plaything.</font>

169
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could tell me anything,
anything at all.</font>

170
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me about all the horses
that she liked,</font>

171
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">the castle that she wanted to live in</font>

172
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the man that she wanted to marry -</font>

173
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.</font>

174
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I challenged him to a duel.</font>

175
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.</font>

176
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.</font>

177
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.</font>

178
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He's just a boy," she said.</font>

179
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Please don't hurt him."</font>

180
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.</font>

181
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she still married to him?</font>

182
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...</font>

183
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.</font>

184
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">She loves him, I'm afraid.</font>

185
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?</font>

186
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just so...</font>

187
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. good.</font>

188
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?</font>

189
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:02,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned that I'll never win, not that way.</font>

190
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's their game,</font>

191
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">their rules.</font>

192
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to fight them.</font>

193
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.</font>

194
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I am.</font>

195
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.</font>

196
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do you want?</font>

197
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, everything, my dear.</font>

198
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything there is.</font>

199
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.</font>

200
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?</font>

202
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.</font>

203
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...</font>

204
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,</font>

205
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.</font>

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sea would come in
closer and closer.</font>

207
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.</font>

208
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it you come from?</font>

209
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Iron lslands.</font>

210
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">They far away?</font>

211
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never heard of the Iron lslands?</font>

212
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.</font>

213
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Trust me, my lord."</font>

214
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not living in the wilderness anymore.</font>

215
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">In civilized lands,
you refer to your betters</font>

216
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">by their proper titles.</font>

217
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And what's that?
- Lord.</font>

218
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

219
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

220
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, why?</font>

221
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron lslands.</font>

222
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that got to do with you?</font>

223
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">if your father's lord,</font>

224
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">how can you be lord too?</font>

225
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?</font>

226
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you...</font>

227
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?</font>

228
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't understand
how you southerners do things.</font>

229
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.</font>

230
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">That makes you a southerner to me.</font>

231
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?</font>

232
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't say, my lord.</font>

233
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know what "impunent" means.</font>

234
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">lmpudent.</font>

235
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means rude, disrespectful.</font>

236
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to lose that chain?</font>

237
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theon Greyjoy!</font>

238
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lady is our guest.</font>

239
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought she was our prisoner.</font>

240
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?</font>

241
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.</font>

242
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm used to worse than him.</font>

243
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

244
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up</font>

245
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pick their teeth with his bones.</font>

246
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you come here?</font>

247
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't mean to come here.</font>

248
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meant to get much further south than this.</font>

249
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far south as south goes,</font>

250
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the long night comes.</font>

251
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What are you afraid of?</font>

252
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:58,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.</font>

253
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Owls and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.</font>

254
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The things you speak of -</font>

255
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">they've been gone
for thousands of years.</font>

256
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wasn't gone, old man.</font>

257
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They was sleeping.</font>

258
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they ain't sleeping no more.</font>

259
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss girls.</font>

260
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.</font>

261
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just looking at them,</font>

262
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">hearing them giggle.</font>

263
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you miss girls?</font>

264
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riders.</font>

265
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horn.
We have to blow the horn.</font>

266
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is he alone?</font>

267
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">One blast for a ranger returning,</font>

268
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">two for wildlings,</font>

269
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- three for...
- There's no rider.</font>

270
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, boy, whoa.</font>

271
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.</font>

272
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my uncle?</font>

273
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned!</font>

274
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Robert.
We were hunting...</font>

275
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">a boar...</font>

276
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have
spent more time with you,</font>

277
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">shown you how to be a man.</font>

278
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never meant to be a father.</font>

279
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

280
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to see this.</font>

281
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">My fault.</font>

282
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too much wine,
missed my thrust.</font>

283
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stinks.</font>

284
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:27,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stinks like death.</font>

285
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think I can't smell it.</font>

286
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid the bastard back, Ned.</font>

287
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drove my knife
right through his brain.</font>

288
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em!</font>

289
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.</font>

290
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.</font>

291
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.</font>

292
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!</font>

We will go home, I promise you.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother was a fool, I know,</font>

because they were his right.</font>

He seized them because he could.</font>

381

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.</font>

383
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:51,970

- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?</font>

384

it was 300 years ago.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,</font>

388
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,650

389

- No, no, don't trouble yourself.</font>

390
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:09,490

I'll rejoin you soon enough.</font>

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,849

You can go home now.</font>

395

<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet reds...</font>

396
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:54,700

Volantis and the Arbor!</font>

399
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,630

name your first child after me.</font>

his name, but I'll try your summerwine.</font>

403
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a taste.</font>

404
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,190

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.</font>

417
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there are many in your homeland

425
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pour.</font>

426
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,720

00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you smell the fruit, ser?</font>

431
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taste it, my lord.</font>

432
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:59,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me that that is not the finest wine

436
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.</font>

437
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will drink.</font>

438

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the Wall...</font>

454
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are all one House.</font>

455
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.</font>

456
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:45,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be a ranger.</font>

457
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't that what you always wanted?</font>

458
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to find my uncle.</font>

459
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:55,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.</font>

460
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.</font>

461
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the steward's life for me.</font>

462
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's honor in being a steward.</font>

463
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much, really.</font>

464
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's food.</font>

465
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here... you begin anew.</font>

466
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man of the Night's Watch...</font>

467
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">lives his life for the realm.</font>

468
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for a king...</font>

469
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a lord, or the honor of this House</font>

470
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">or that House,</font>

471
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">not for gold or glory,</font>

472
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a woman's love,</font>

473
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">but for the realm</font>

474
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all the people in it.</font>

475
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've all learned
the words of the vow.</font>

476
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think carefully before you say them.</font>

477
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The penalty for desertion...</font>

478
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">is death.</font>

479
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can take your vows here...</font>

480
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">tonight...</font>

481
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">at sunset.</font>

482
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do any of you still keep the old gods?</font>

483
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do, my lord.</font>

484
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:24,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.</font>

485
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

486
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.</font>

487
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your old gods too, maybe.</font>

488
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, might I go as well?</font>

489
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does House Tarly keep the old gods?</font>

490
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my lord.</font>

491
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:43,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was named in the light of the Seven,</font>

492
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">as my father was
and his father before him.</font>

493
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?</font>

494
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch is my House now.</font>

495
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Seven have never answered my prayers.</font>

496
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps the old gods will.</font>

497
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you wish, lad.</font>

498
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:06,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've all been assigned an order,</font>

499
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:09,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">according to our needs</font>

500
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your strengths.</font>

501
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halder to the builders.</font>

502
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyp to the stewards.</font>

503
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.</font>

504
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell to the stewards.</font>

505
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.</font>

506
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Balian to the rangers.</font>

507
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rast to the rangers.</font>

508
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon to the stewards.</font>

509
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rancer to the builder.</font>

510
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:36,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.</font>

511
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.</font>

512
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.</font>

513
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.</font>

514
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nelugo to the rangers.</font>

515
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:52,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">May all the gods preserve you.</font>

516
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rangers with me.</font>

517
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Builders!</font>

518
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.</font>

519
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.</font>

520
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.</font>

521
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.</font>

522
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.</font>

523
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make no comment about his nose.</font>

524
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont</font>

525
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">has requested you
for his personal steward.</font>

526
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?</font>

527
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,</font>

528
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">change his sheets
and blankets daily</font>

529
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.</font>

530
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you take me for a servant?</font>

531
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.</font>

532
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:17,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">But perhaps we were wrong in that.</font>

533
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- May I go?
- As you wish.</font>

534
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:30,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?</font>

535
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.</font>

536
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted it and he got it.</font>

537
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stewards are nothing but maids!</font>

538
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!</font>

539
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not fair.
- Fair?</font>

540
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall</font>

541
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.</font>

542
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.</font>

543
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now I'm here -
at the end of the world</font>

544
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.</font>

545
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never see my family again.</font>

546
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never be inside a woman again.</font>

547
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't tell me about fair.</font>

548
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.</font>

549
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?</font>

550
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.</font>

551
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now listen to me.</font>

552
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.</font>

553
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:29,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be with him day and night.</font>

554
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you'll clean his clothes.</font>

555
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:35,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,</font>

556
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">squire for him in battle.</font>

557
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll know everything,
be part of everything.</font>

558
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he asked for you himself.</font>

559
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to groom you for command.</font>

560
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just...</font>

561
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wanted to be a ranger.</font>

562
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:01,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always wanted to be a wizard.</font>

563
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

564
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm serious.</font>

565
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'll stay
and say your words with me?</font>

566
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark... a moment.</font>

567
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:23,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alone, if you will.</font>

568
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">He named you Protector of the Realm.</font>

569
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did.</font>

570
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't care.</font>

571
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:43,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me an hour and I can put
a hundred swords at your command.</font>

572
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what should I do
with a hundred swords?</font>

573
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.</font>

574
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.</font>

575
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.</font>

576
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.</font>

577
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.</font>

578
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Stannis?</font>

579
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?</font>

580
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.</font>

581
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis is your older brother.</font>

582
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.</font>

583
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.</font>

584
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's best for the Kingdoms?</font>

585
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's best for the people we rule?</font>

586
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all know what Stannis is.</font>

587
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">He inspires no love or loyalty.</font>

588
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a king.</font>

589
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

590
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:47,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stannis is a commander.</font>

591
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's led men into war twice.</font>

592
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.</font>

593
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.</font>

594
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me something.</font>

595
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:00,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?</font>

596
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not dishonor Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...</font>

597
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and dragging frightened children
from their beds.</font>

598
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.</font>

599
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.</font>

600
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not his steward...</font>

00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">not his captain of the guard...</font>

602
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:41,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not his wife.</font>

603
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Stannis himself.</font>

604
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lord.</font>

605
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now leave us.</font>

606
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:07,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord Protector.</font>

607
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king has no trueborn sons.</font>

608
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey and Tommen...</font>

609
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">are Jaime Lannister's bastards.</font>

610
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...</font>

611
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stannis.</font>

612
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it would seem.</font>

613
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unless...
- There is no "unless".</font>

614
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.</font>

615
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he cannot take the throne
without your help.</font>

616
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.</font>

617
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a shred of honor?</font>

618
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.</font>

619
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of the power is yours.
You need only...</font>

620
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">reach out and take it.</font>

621
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make peace with the Lannisters.</font>

622
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Release the lmp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.</font>

623
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:06,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,</font>

624
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,</font>

625
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">we simply reveal his little secret</font>

626
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?</font>

627
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need someone to share these burdens,
I assure you.</font>

628
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">My price would be modest.</font>

629
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you suggest is treason.</font>

630
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only if we lose.</font>

631
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say...</font>

632
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the people who tried to murder my boy.</font>

633
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.</font>

634
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why it's called "making peace".</font>

635
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I won't do it.</font>

636
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it will be Stannis and war?</font>

637
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no other choice.</font>

638
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:52,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is the heir.</font>

639
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why did you call me here?</font>

640
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for my wisdom, clearly.</font>

641
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised Catelyn
you would help me.</font>

642
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -</font>

643
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:07,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.</font>

644
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:09,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need the gold cloaks.</font>

645
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">The City Watch is 2,000 strong...</font>

646
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sworn to defend the king's peace.</font>

647
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.</font>

648
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you want me to do,</font>

649
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know it has to be done,</font>

650
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's not honorable, so...</font>

651
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">the words stick in your throat.</font>

652
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:33,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the queen proclaims one king</font>

653
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Hand proclaims another,</font>

654
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?</font>

655
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do they follow?</font>

656
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:48,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who pays them.</font>

657
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.</font>

658
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Night gathers
and now my watch begins.</font>

659
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shall not end until my death.</font>

660
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall take no wife,</font>

661
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">hold no lands,
father no children.</font>

662
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:55,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall wear no crowns

663
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall live and die at my post.</font>

664
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the sword in the darkness.</font>

665
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the watcher on the walls.</font>

666
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.</font>

667
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:12,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,</font>

668
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:16,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">for this night
and all the nights to come.</font>

669
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:18,750

670
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,369

Bring it here.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods be good!</font>

675
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will they do to him?</font>

676
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle</font>

677
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.</font>

678
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,590

00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?</font>

753
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">A piece of paper?</font>

754
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.</font>

755
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:21,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.</font>

756
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow me to return the courtesy.</font>

757
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bend the knee, my lord.</font>

758
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...</font>

759
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we shall allow you
to live out your days</font>

760
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:36,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the gray waste you call home.</font>

761
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:39,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your son has no claim to the throne.</font>

762
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liar!</font>

763
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.</font>

764
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:45,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.</font>

765
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.</font>

766
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think he stands alone?</font>

767
00:55:57,469 --> 00:56:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!</font>

768

<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.</font>

770
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men of the Watch!</font>

771

00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your men to lay down their swords.</font>

773
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:22,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one needs to die.</font>

774

<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>
