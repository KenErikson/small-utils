<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me. Look at me!</font>

2
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember me now, boy, eh?</font>

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember me?
There's a bright boy.</font>

4
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:23,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.</font>

5
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!</font>

6
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?</font>

7
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to live, boy?</font>

8
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">North, boy, we're going north.</font>

9
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had three eyes.</font>

10
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It told me to come with him, so I did.</font>

11
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.</font>

12
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father's not down there, little lord.</font>

13
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for many years yet.</font>

14
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.</font>

15
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?</font>

16
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.</font>

17
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.</font>

18
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.</font>

19
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Lyanna, my father's sister.</font>

20
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert was supposed to marry her,</font>

21
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.</font>

22
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert started a war to win her back.</font>

23
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.</font>

24
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where I saw Father.</font>

25
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? He's not here.</font>

26
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Shaggydog.
Rickon!</font>

27
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!</font>

28
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?</font>

29
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.</font>

30
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.</font>

31
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was down here. I saw him.</font>

32
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saw him when?</font>

33
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, when I was sleeping.</font>

34
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Shaggydog.</font>

35
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You both miss him.</font>

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,</font>

37
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that doesn't mean that...</font>

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get the girls back.</font>

55
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,319

71
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,779

at that tavern.</font>

72

78
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you got to keep one, which would it be?</font>

79
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,759

<font color="#FFFFFF">This one here.</font>

101
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at it and see what happens to traitors.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.</font>

103
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,929

I won't do any treason, I swear...</font>

So you'll stay here... and obey.</font>

107
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him!</font>

108
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

109
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do I have to look?</font>

110
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as it pleases me.</font>

111
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see the rest?</font>

112
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,679

117
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,490

should never strike his lady.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, girl.</font>

121
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you obey now?</font>

122
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you need another lesson?</font>

123
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll look for you in court.</font>

124
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save yourself some pain, girl.</font>

125
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him what he wants.</font>

126
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be needing that again.</font>

127
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">The proper course is clear -</font>

128
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.</font>

129

<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly is not the king.</font>

130
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.</font>

131
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put your father to death.</font>

132
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make Renly king.</font>

133
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's Robert's youngest brother.</font>

134

<font color="#FFFFFF">if Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.</font>

135
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?</font>

136
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Renly is not right!
- My lords.</font>

- My lords!</font>

138

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here is what I say to these two kings.</font>

139
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,</font>

140

<font color="#FFFFFF">nor Stannis neither.</font>

141
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,330

from some flowery seat in the South?</font>

142
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?</font>

143
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even their gods are wrong!</font>

144
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?</font>

145
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the dragons we bowed to...</font>

146
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now the dragons are dead!</font>

147

I mean to bend my knee to -</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the King in the North!</font>

149
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have peace on those terms.</font>

150
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can keep their Red Castle</font>

151
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their iron chair too.</font>

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saved you.
- Saved me?</font>

302
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.</font>

303
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw my god's house burn,</font>

304
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">there where I had healed men and women
beyond counting.</font>

305
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the streets I saw piles of heads...</font>

306
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">the head of the baker who makes my bread,</font>

307
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.</font>

308
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?</font>

309
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your life.</font>

310
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you take a look at your khal...</font>

311
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...</font>

312
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">when all the rest has gone.</font>

313
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't!</font>

314
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my way, Sam.</font>

315
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll put out the word.</font>

316
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.</font>

317
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what happens to deserters?</font>

318
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than you do.</font>

319
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do?</font>

320
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna find my brother</font>

321
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.</font>

322
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't leave us now.
We need you here.</font>

323
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Move.
- I won't let you go.</font>

324
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Move.
- No.</font>

325
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah!</font>

326
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hand of the King?</font>

327
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it would seem.</font>

328
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?</font>

329
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he said I couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.</font>

330
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?</font>

331
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:16,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

332
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said,
"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?</font>

333
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe he used the word "whore".</font>

334
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ashamed of me?</font>

335
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you afraid that I'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?</font>

336
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm funny now?</font>

337
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Shae, the funny whore.</font>

338
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.</font>

339
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:39,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly the richest.</font>

340
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.</font>

341
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.</font>

342
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's always been a cunt.</font>

343
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal</font>

344
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a girl like you.</font>

345
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:09,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?</font>

346
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:14,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...</font>

347
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what a Hand needs.</font>

348
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:34,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghost?</font>

349
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah!</font>

350
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah! Hyah!</font>

351
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah!</font>

352
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell!</font>

353
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.</font>

354
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we get him?</font>

355
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, help me get him up.</font>

356
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky you've got plenty of padding.</font>

357
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're taking you back to where you belong.</font>

358
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.</font>

359
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.</font>

360
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.</font>

361
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.</font>

362
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.</font>

363
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took the oath. You can't leave.</font>

364
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have to.
- You can't.</font>

365
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:26,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said the words.
- I don't care about...</font>

366
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow..."</font>

367
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:33,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.</font>

368
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">"It shall not end until my death.</font>

370

371
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The watcher on the walls..."</font>

372
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The shield that guards the realms of men.</font>

373
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,299

to the Night's Watch,</font>

375
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember
our first ride, my sun and stars?</font>

376
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you are in there, if you haven't gone away,
show me.</font>

377
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.</font>

378
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to fight now.</font>

379
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're very far away,</font>

380
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">but come back to me, my sun and stars.</font>

381
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the sun...</font>

382
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">rises in the west...</font>

383
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. and sets in the east...</font>

384
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.</font>

385
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kings?</font>

386
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can tell you all there is
to know about kings.</font>

387
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing you need to understand
about kings is...</font>

388
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the past 67 years, I've known...</font>

389
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">truly known...
more kings than any man alive.</font>

390
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.</font>

391
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

392
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And keep on serving them.</font>

393
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aerys Targaryen.</font>

394
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...</font>

395
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">madness is the worst.</font>

396
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good man.</font>

397
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a charmer.</font>

398
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">To watch him melt away before my eyes...</font>

399
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">consumed by dreams of fire and blood...</font>

400
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -</font>

401
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">powerful man, great warrior -</font>

402
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom</font>

403
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">are rather different things.</font>

404
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say that...</font>

405
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:28,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,</font>

406

to the enemies at his side.</font>

407
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I serve his son...</font>

408
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Joffrey...</font>

409
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">may the gods bless his reign.</font>

410
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:48,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.</font>

411
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stern.</font>

412
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sternness in defense of the realm
is no vice.</font>

413
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...</font>

414
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:07,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.</font>

415
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

416
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">True greatness.</font>

417
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the thing?</font>

418
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">What thing?</font>

419
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">About kings.</font>

420
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said, "The thing you
need to understand about kings..."</font>

421
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Things? What?</font>

422
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you started, you...
Never mind.</font>

423
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see you out, my dear.</font>

424
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.</font>

425
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Till the next time.</font>

426
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

427
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?</font>

428
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the crown fit?</font>

429
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,</font>

430
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">the ones who sneered at you for years?</font>

431
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.</font>

432
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man with great ambition and no morals -</font>

433
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't bet against you.</font>

434
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?</font>

435
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.</font>

436
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.</font>

437
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can do better than that.</font>

438
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:13,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?</font>

439
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've always wondered.
- Have you?</font>

440
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?</font>

441
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?</font>

442
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.</font>

443
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...</font>

444
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man from another land,</font>

445
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,019

00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,349

<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?</font>

449
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you carry on...</font>

450
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.</font>

451
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire you.</font>

452
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I admire you, Lord Baelish.</font>

453
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...</font>

454
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.</font>

455
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

456
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">here we stand...</font>

457
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">in mutual admiration and respect.</font>

458
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing our roles.</font>

00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:16,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Serving a new king.</font>

460
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long may he reign.</font>

461
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My king.
- My king.</font>

462
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lords. Shall we begin?</font>

463
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Arry now, hear me?</font>

464
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arry the orphan boy.</font>

465
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:35,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.</font>

466
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

467
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arry.</font>

468
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.</font>

469
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.</font>

470
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,</font>

471
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I didn't find no little lordlings
down there.</font>

472
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">This lot -</font>

473
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.</font>

474
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.</font>

475
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:07,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.</font>

476
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay with this lot, boy.</font>

477
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">And stay...</font>

478
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.</font>

479
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself, midget.</font>

480
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a sword, this one.</font>

481
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?</font>

482
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.</font>

483
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks like a girl.</font>

484
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet he stole that sword.</font>

485
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a look.</font>

486
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use me a sword like that.</font>

487
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:45,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.</font>

488
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:48,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.</font>

489
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen him kick a boy to death.</font>

490
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls</font>

491
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.</font>

492
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kicked him all to pieces.</font>

493
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?</font>

494
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:02,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give it to you.</font>

495
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already killed one fat boy.</font>

496
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:08,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you never killed anyone.</font>

497
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.</font>

498
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good at killing fat boys.</font>

499
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like killing fat boys.</font>

500
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like picking on the little ones, do you?</font>

501
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.</font>

502
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I hit that steel, it sings.</font>

503
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:27,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna sing when I hit you?</font>

504
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is castle-forged steel.</font>

505
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you steal it?</font>

506
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.</font>

507
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.</font>

508
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...</font>

509
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">murderers.</font>

510
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.</font>

511
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my master got sick of me, so...
here I am.</font>

512
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you sorry sons of whores!</font>

513
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!</font>

514
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:06,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And winter is coming!</font>

515
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ham.</font>

516
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?</font>

517
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:47,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me some beer at least.</font>

518
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look exhausted.</font>

519
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was your moonlight ride that tiring?</font>

520
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look so terrified.</font>

521
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,</font>

522

<font color="#FFFFFF">only ghosts would guard the Wall.</font>

523
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,789

524
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,579

530
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had enough of that sort of thing.</font>

reporting whole villages abandoned.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains</font>

is more important than ours?</font>

540

who sits on the Iron Throne?</font>

543
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Good.</font>

and wait for the snows.</font>

548
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:33,539

the Night's Watch</font>

557
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,150
