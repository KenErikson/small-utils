1
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to drink, child.</font>

2
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And eat.</font>

3
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't there anything else?</font>

4
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.</font>

5
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can't live on grass.</font>

6
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,</font>

7
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">they say there are fields of ghost grass</font>

8
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:50,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.</font>

9
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It murders all other grass.</font>

10
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki believe that one day</font>

11
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.</font>

12
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll get easier.</font>

13
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khaleesi!</font>

14
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hands.</font>

15
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.</font>

16
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.</font>

17
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be more comfortable there.</font>

18
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.</font>

19
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.</font>

20
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you wish, Your Grace.</font>

21
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,</font>

22
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it is preferable to beheading.</font>

23
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did Ned Stark want you for?</font>

24
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buying from a slaver?</font>

25
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selling to one.</font>

26
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some poachers I caught on my land.</font>

27
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.</font>

28
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can rest assured of that.</font>

29
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.</font>

30
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother's been looking for you.</font>

31
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ride for King's Landing today.</font>

32
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark</font>

33
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:29,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">and offer your sympathies.</font>

34
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What good will my sympathies do them?</font>

35
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">None. But it is expected of you.</font>

36
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your absence has already been noted.</font>

37
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy means nothing to me.</font>

38
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't stand
the wailing of women.</font>

39
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">One word and I'll hit you again.</font>

40
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling Mother!</font>

41
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Tell her.</font>

42
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark</font>

43
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will fall on your knees
in front of them</font>

44
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,</font>

45
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?</font>

46
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't...</font>

47
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

48
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Prince will
remember that, little lord.</font>

49
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope so.</font>

50
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.</font>

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Time for breakfast.</font>

52
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bread. And two of those little fish.</font>

53
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.</font>

54
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And bacon, burnt black.</font>

55
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah.</font>

56
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.</font>

57
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Bran going to die?</font>

58
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently not.</font>

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.</font>

60
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.</font>

61
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the gods know for certain.</font>

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the rest of us can do is pray.</font>

63
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.</font>

64
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still can't believe you're going.</font>

65
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ridiculous, even for you.</font>

66
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your sense of wonder?</font>

67
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:35,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,</font>

68
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">the wintry abode of the white walkers.</font>

69
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.</font>

70
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And go celibate?
The whores would go begging</font>

71
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Dorne to Casterly Rock.</font>

72
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall</font>

73
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">and piss off the edge of the world.</font>

74
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The children don't need to hear your filth.</font>

75
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

76
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.</font>

77
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a good, clean death any day.</font>

78
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.</font>

79
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death is so final, whereas life...</font>

80
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">ah, life is full of possibilities.</font>

81
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.</font>

82
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear brother,</font>

83
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.</font>

84
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear brother, you wound me.</font>

85
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how much
I love my family.</font>

86
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

87
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.</font>

88
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your home. I'm your guest.</font>

89
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Handsome one, isn't he?</font>

90
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.</font>

91
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a fighter too -</font>

92
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">tried to beat the fever that took him.</font>

93
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

94
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.</font>

95
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew.</font>

96
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was years ago.</font>

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,</font>

98
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the things men do
to show you how much they care.</font>

99
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy looked just like him.</font>

100
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a little thing.</font>

101
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bird without feathers.</font>

102
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">They came to take his body away</font>

103
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.</font>

104
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little bundle.</font>

105
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took him away
and I never saw him again.</font>

106
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never have visited the crypt, never.</font>

107
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray to the Mother
every morning and night</font>

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">that she return your child to you.</font>

109
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am grateful.</font>

110
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps this time she'll listen.</font>

111
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sword for the Wall?</font>

112
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I already have one.
- Good man.</font>

113
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.</font>

114
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">At someone, I mean.</font>

115
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.</font>

116
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,</font>

117
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some bone to keep it all standing.</font>

118
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me thank you ahead of time</font>

119
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -</font>

120
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.</font>

121
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.</font>

122
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.</font>

123
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it "we" already?</font>

124
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you taken your vows, then?</font>

125
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon enough.</font>

126
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give my regards to the Night's Watch.</font>

127
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...</font>

128
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's only for life.</font>

129
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Nymeria.</font>

130
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.</font>

131
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">My things weren't
properly folded, she says.</font>

132
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.</font>

133
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good you've got help.</font>

134
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch.</font>

135
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nymeria, gloves.</font>

136
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Impressive.
- Shut up.</font>

137
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nymeria, gloves!</font>

138
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something for you.</font>

139
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it has to be packed very carefully.</font>

140
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">A present?</font>

141
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close the door.</font>

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no toy.</font>

143
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful you don't cut yourself.</font>

144
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's so skinny.
- So are you.</font>

145
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.</font>

146
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't hack a man's head off,</font>

147
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.</font>

148
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.</font>

149
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it feel?</font>

150
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like the balance?</font>

151
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.</font>

152
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.</font>

153
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know which end to use.</font>

154
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to miss you.</font>

155
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful.</font>

156
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the best swords have names, you know.</font>

157
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa can keep her sewing needles.</font>

158
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a needle of my own.</font>

159
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to say goodbye to Bran.</font>

160
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've said it.</font>

161
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could be here when you wake up.</font>

162
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.</font>

163
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking the black.</font>

164
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,</font>

165
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.</font>

166
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll know my way around by then.</font>

167
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.</font>

168
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.</font>

169
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you...</font>

170
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">to leave.</font>

171
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">17 years ago</font>

172
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">you rode off with Robert Baratheon.</font>

173
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came back a year later
with another woman's son.</font>

174
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you're leaving again.</font>

175
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no choice.</font>

176
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what men always say
when honor calls.</font>

177
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.</font>

178
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do have a choice.</font>

179
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've made it.</font>

180
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cat...</font>

181
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do it, Ned.</font>

182
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really can't.</font>

183
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can.</font>

184
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must.</font>

185
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've said goodbye to Bran?</font>

186
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not going to die. I know it.</font>

187
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Starks are hard to kill.</font>

188
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother?</font>

189
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She was very kind.
- Good.</font>

190
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.</font>

191
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was always my color.</font>

192
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Farewell, Snow.</font>

193
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, Stark.</font>

194
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.</font>

195
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.</font>

196
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are a Stark.</font>

197
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might not have my name,</font>

198
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you have my blood.</font>

199
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my mother alive?</font>

200
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?</font>

201
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she care?</font>

202
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next time we see each other,</font>

203
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:46,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll talk about your mother.</font>

204
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

205
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

206
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, this is country!</font>

207
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.</font>

208
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've half a mind to go with you.</font>

209
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,</font>

210
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.</font>

211
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have asked me 20 years ago.</font>

212
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were wars to fight,
women to marry -</font>

213
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">we never had the chance to be young.</font>

214
00:21:58,349 --> 00:21:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recall a few chances.</font>

215
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?</font>

216
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">That common girl of yours?</font>

217
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.</font>

218
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:13,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bessie.
She was one of yours.</font>

219
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.</font>

220
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And her tits.</font>

221
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours was, er... Aleena?</font>

222
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?</font>

223
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your bastard's mother?</font>

224
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wylla.
- That's it.</font>

225
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must have been a rare wench</font>

226
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.</font>

227
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never told me what she looked like.</font>

228
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor will I.</font>

229
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were at war.</font>

230
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.</font>

231
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.</font>

232
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.</font>

233
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:00,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">The worst thing about your coronation -</font>

234
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never get to hit you again.</font>

235
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, that's not the worst thing.</font>

236
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a rider in the night.</font>

237
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.</font>

238
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?</font>

239
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,</font>

240
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a bold man to wield it.</font>

241
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:31,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's little more than a child.</font>

242
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.</font>

243
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?</font>

244
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:42,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.</font>

245
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -</font>

246
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">the woman I loved.</font>

247
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.</font>

248
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?</font>

249
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:54,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Khal Drogo,</font>

250
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.</font>

251
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,</font>

252
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.</font>

253
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have no ships, Robert.</font>

254
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.</font>

255
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,</font>

256
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.</font>

257
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.</font>

258
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a war coming, Ned.</font>

259
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,</font>

260
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's coming.</font>

261
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

262
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:48,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be fed.</font>

263
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Untie them.</font>

264
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, rapers.</font>

265
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.</font>

266
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most choose the knife.</font>

267
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not impressed by your new brothers?</font>

268
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely thing about the Watch -</font>

269
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.</font>

270
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you read so much?</font>

271
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me and tell me what you see.</font>

272
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a trick?</font>

273
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you see is a dwarf.</font>

274
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:46,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.</font>

275
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:50,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.</font>

276
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are expected of me.</font>

277
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.</font>

278
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until your brother killed that king.</font>

279
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, until my brother killed him.</font>

280
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is full of these little ironies.</font>

281
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister married the new king, and...</font>

282
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.</font>

283
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must do my part for the honor of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?</font>

284
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how?</font>

285
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my brother has his sword</font>

286
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have my mind,</font>

287
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.</font>

288
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.</font>

289
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you?</font>

290
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your story, bastard?</font>

291
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.</font>

292
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,</font>

293
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,</font>

294
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.</font>

295
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:08,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...</font>

296
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks</font>

297
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.</font>

298
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a smart boy.</font>

299
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe that nonsense.</font>

300
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:31,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.</font>

301
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:10,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.</font>

302
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.</font>

303
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to Poole about it.</font>

304
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.</font>

305
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a new steward,</font>

306
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there are several other
appointments that require</font>

307
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!</font>

308
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make the appointments.</font>

309
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.</font>

310
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, my lord.</font>

311
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady.</font>

312
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was the last time you left this room?</font>

313
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:04,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to take care of him.</font>

314
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not going to die, Mother.</font>

315
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.</font>

316
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he's wrong?</font>

317
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.</font>

318
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's six.</font>

319
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,</font>

320
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!</font>

321
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!</font>

322
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire.</font>

323
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay here. I'll come back.</font>

324
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supposed to be here.</font>

325
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one is supposed to be here.</font>

326
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a mercy.</font>

327
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead already.</font>

328
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

329
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.</font>

330
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:16,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everywhere? Even in the East?</font>

331
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">No dragon. Brave men kill them.</font>

332
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is known.
- It is known.</font>

333
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.</font>

334
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The moon?</font>

335
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,</font>

336
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:34,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">that once there were two moons in the sky.</font>

337
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,</font>

338
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons</font>

339
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they drank the sun's fire.</font>

340
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moon is no egg.</font>

341
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moon is goddess - wife of sun.</font>

342
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is known.
- It is known.</font>

343
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me with her.</font>

344
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?</font>

345
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:10,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men like to talk when they're happy.</font>

346
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.</font>

347
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">How old were you?</font>

348
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.</font>

349
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine?</font>

350
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.</font>

351
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:28,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">First you must learn.</font>

352
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?</font>

353
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

354
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will it take three years?</font>

355
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

356
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome.</font>

357
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.</font>

358
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think Bran fell from that tower.</font>

359
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he was thrown.</font>

360
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy was always
surefooted before.</font>

361
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone tried to kill him twice.</font>

362
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:57,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Why murder an innocent child?</font>

363
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.</font>

364
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.</font>

365
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.</font>

366
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:10,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.</font>

367
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you notice the dagger the killer used?</font>

368
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too fine a weapon for such a man.</font>

369
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:18,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.</font>

370
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone gave it to him.</font>

371
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?</font>

372
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's war they want...</font>

373
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.</font>

374
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?</font>

375
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

376
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too easily words of war
become acts of war.</font>

377
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know the truth yet.</font>

378
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark must be told of this.</font>

379
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.</font>

380
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.</font>

381
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.</font>

382
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.</font>

383
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must.</font>

384
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.</font>

385
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.</font>

386
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.</font>

387
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me accompany you at least.</font>

388
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.</font>

389
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Bran?</font>

390
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.</font>

391
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bran's life is in their hands now.</font>

392
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Khaleesi.</font>

393
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must look in his eyes always.</font>

394
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love comes in at the eyes.</font>

395
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:32,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man</font>

396
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">with nothing but her eyes.</font>

397
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finish a man?</font>

398
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

399
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kings traveled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.</font>

400
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:48,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magisters sold their palaces.</font>

401
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.</font>

402
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say a thousand men
proposed to her</font>

403
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she refused them all.</font>

404
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.</font>

405
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I don't think</font>

406
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Drogo will like it with me on top.</font>

407
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will make him like it, Khaleesi.</font>

408
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:11,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men want what they've never had.</font>

409
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:14,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.</font>

410
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a slave, Khaleesi?</font>

411
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then don't make love like a slave.</font>

412
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Khaleesi.</font>

413
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out there he is the mighty khal,</font>

414
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in this tent, he belongs to you.</font>

415
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I don't think</font>

416
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this is the Dothraki way.</font>

417
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wanted the Dothraki way,</font>

418
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">why did he marry you?</font>

419
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

420
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

421
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight I would look upon your face!</font>

422
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, ser.</font>

423
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I frighten you so much, girl?</font>

424
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is it him there making you shake?</font>

425
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He frightens me too.</font>

426
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that face.</font>

427
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:05,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.</font>

428
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't he speak to me?</font>

429
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.</font>

430
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.</font>

431
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks damn well
with his sword though.</font>

432
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.</font>

433
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Royal Executioner.</font>

434
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, sweet lady?</font>

435
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does the hound frighten you?</font>

436
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Away with you, dog.</font>

437
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're scaring my lady.</font>

438
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like to see you upset.</font>

439
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sun's finally shining.</font>

440
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come walk with me.</font>

441
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay, Lady.</font>

442
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I probably shouldn't have any more.</font>

443
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.</font>

444
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">My princess can drink
as much as she wants.</font>

445
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. You're safe with me.</font>

446
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you!</font>

447
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

448
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

449
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

450
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go away.
- Your sister?</font>

451
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.</font>

452
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.</font>

453
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?</font>

454
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:08,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.</font>

455
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:10,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.</font>

456
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your prince, not your lord,</font>

457
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I said pick up your sword.</font>

458
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.</font>

459
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're not a knight.</font>

460
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a butcher's boy.</font>

461
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?</font>

462
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:31,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.</font>

463
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't hurt him...</font>

464
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">much.</font>

465
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

466
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filthy little bitch!</font>

467
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!</font>

468
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:53,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!</font>

469
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:56,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll gut you, you little cunt!</font>

470
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Arya!
- Nymeria!</font>

471
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

472
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nymeria!</font>

473
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

474
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Please don't.</font>

475
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya, leave him alone.</font>

476
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.</font>

477
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.</font>

478
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then go!</font>

479
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me.</font>

480
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.</font>

481
00:46:56,929 --> 00:47:00,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.</font>

482
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. Run.</font>

483
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Leave now!</font>

484
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:12,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.</font>

485
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I heard a noise.</font>

486
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:25,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

487
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

488
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

489
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

490
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

491
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arya!</font>

492
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord!</font>

493
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord! They've found her.</font>

494
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's unharmed.
- Arya!</font>

495
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.</font>

496
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.</font>

497
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Arya!
- Right, get back.</font>

498
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.</font>

499
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back! Back to the inn!</font>

500
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:14,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">All back!</font>

501
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:24,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</font>

502
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you hurt?
- No.</font>

503
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's all right.</font>

504
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the meaning of this?</font>

505
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?</font>

506
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?</font>

507
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet, woman.</font>

508
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.</font>

509
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we need to get
this business done quickly.</font>

510
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:48,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.</font>

511
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.</font>

512
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true!</font>

513
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just... bit him a little.</font>

514
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.</font>

515
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:02,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.</font>

516
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what happened!</font>

517
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:07,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.</font>

518
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Liar!
- Shut up!</font>

519
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

520
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.</font>

521
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?</font>

522
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.</font>

523
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not.</font>

524
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa, come here, darling.</font>

525
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:38,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, child...</font>

526
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell me what happened.</font>

527
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:43,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell it all and tell it true.</font>

528
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great crime to lie to a king.</font>

529
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

530
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.</font>

531
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't see.
- Liar!</font>

532
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:04,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!</font>

533
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:07,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!</font>

534
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.</font>

535
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,</font>

536
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">whip her through the streets?</font>

537
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, children fight. It's over.</font>

538
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:20,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.</font>

539
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:25,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let that little girl disarm you?</font>

540
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.</font>

541
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.</font>

542
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what of the direwolf?</font>

543
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">What of the beast
that savaged your son?</font>

544
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:49,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd forgot the damned wolf.</font>

545
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.</font>

546
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? So be it.</font>

547
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have another wolf.</font>

548
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:02,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you will.</font>

549
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.</font>

550
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.</font>

551
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:12,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't mean Lady, does he?</font>

552
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!</font>

553
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!</font>

554
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.</font>

555
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please, it wasn't Lady!</font>

556
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your command?</font>

557
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:27,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Grace?</font>

558
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:37,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.</font>

559
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.</font>

560
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

561
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jory...</font>

562
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">take the girls to their rooms.</font>

563
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:53,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it must be done,</font>

564
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I'll do it myself.</font>

565
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this some trick?</font>

566
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolf is of the North.</font>

567
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">She deserves better than a butcher.</font>

568
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?</font>

569
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">He ran.</font>

570
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:45,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not very fast.</font>
