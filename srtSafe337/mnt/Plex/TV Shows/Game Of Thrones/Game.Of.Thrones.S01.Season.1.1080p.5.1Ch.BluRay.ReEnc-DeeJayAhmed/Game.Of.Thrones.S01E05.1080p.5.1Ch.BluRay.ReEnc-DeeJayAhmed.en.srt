any family in the capital?</font>

2
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

3
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stood vigil
for him myself last night.</font>

4
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had no one else.</font>

5
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd never worn this armor before.</font>

6
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.</font>

7
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who determines the draw?</font>

8
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.</font>

9
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

10
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who holds the straws?</font>

11
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done good work, Sisters.</font>

12
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is strange.</font>

13
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.</font>

14
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.</font>

15
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.</font>

16
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too modest.</font>

17
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.</font>

18
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.</font>

19
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.</font>

20
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a fine man, your father.</font>

21
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.</font>

22
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that lad -</font>

23
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was a squire
until a few months ago.</font>

24
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could he afford a new suit of armor?</font>

25
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?</font>

26
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.</font>

27
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert tends
to do what he wants.</font>

28
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the king got what
he wanted all the time,</font>

29
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.</font>

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.</font>

31
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.</font>

32
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that?</font>

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.</font>

34
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't even put
a man's armor on him properly.</font>

35
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're too fat for your armor.
- Fat?</font>

36
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fat, is it?</font>

37
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you speak to your king?</font>

38
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's funny, is it?</font>

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, Your Grace.
- No?</font>

40
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like the Hand's joke?</font>

41
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're torturing the poor boy.</font>

42
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armor.</font>

43
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!</font>

44
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:50,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The breastplate stretcher"?</font>

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long before he figures it out?</font>

46
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.</font>

47
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.</font>

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.</font>

49
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!</font>

50
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.</font>

51
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.</font>

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.</font>

53
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?</font>

54
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:18,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

55
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.</font>

56
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink. Your king commands it.</font>

57
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods,</font>

58
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">too fat for my armor.</font>

59
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your squire -
a Lannister boy?</font>

60
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. A bloody idiot,</font>

61
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Cersei insisted.</font>

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.</font>

63
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.</font>

64
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You'll need her father on your side."</font>

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.</font>

66
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.</font>

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least I can smell
someone else's blood.</font>

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Robert.
- What?</font>

69
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

70
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">An inspiring sight for the people, eh?</font>

71
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!</font>

72
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.</font>

73
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Knight of the Flowers.</font>

74
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Ser Loras.</font>

75
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.</font>

76
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- I can't watch.</font>

77
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.</font>

78
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?</font>

79
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?</font>

80
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?</font>

81
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.</font>

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras rides well.</font>

83
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a shame, Littlefinger.</font>

84
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.</font>

85
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell me, Lord Renly,</font>

86
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">when will you be having your friend?</font>

87
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.</font>

88
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Loras would never do that.</font>

89
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's no honor in tricks.
- No honor and quite a bit of gold.</font>

90
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sword!</font>

91
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him be!</font>

92
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop this madness
in the name of your king!</font>

93
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him go!</font>

94
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you my life, ser.</font>

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no ser.</font>

96
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remove his hood.</font>

97
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ On that eve, the captive lmp</font>

98
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Downwards from his horse did limp</font>

99
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,129

101
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't the Kingsroad.</font>

102
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.</font>

103
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,</font>

104
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking for me in the wrong place.</font>

105
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.</font>

106
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be offering a handsome reward.</font>

107
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.</font>

108
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you be so good as to untie me?</font>

109
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And why would I do that?
- Why not?</font>

110
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.</font>

111
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless a shadowcat ate me first.</font>

112
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.</font>

113

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the eastern road.</font>

114
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,340

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.</font>

116
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?</font>

117
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five years ago.
- She's changed.</font>

118
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.</font>

119
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am l.</font>

120
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.</font>

121

- What sort of imbecile</font>

122

<font color="#FFFFFF">arms an assassin with his own blade?</font>

123
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should I gag him?
- Why?</font>

124
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I starting to make sense?</font>

125
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,330

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

130
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,120

- I'll be fine, my lady.</font>

152

- "Righteous in wrath."</font>

- "Family, duty, honor."</font>

155

your mother's.</font>

- Family, duty, honor...</font>

157

- You know it is.</font>

158

159
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,019

to protect the family.</font>

160

161
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she's not with her family?</font>

162
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother sat by your bed</font>

163
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">for three weeks while you slept.</font>

164
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then she left!</font>

165
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.</font>

166
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,289

<font color="#FFFFFF">From that moment
until the moment she dies,</font>

168
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">she will love you.</font>

169
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

170
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?</font>

171
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still can't tell you,</font>

172
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?</font>

173
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today?</font>

174
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me</font>

175
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,899

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never shoot another arrow.</font>

178
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where is that written?</font>

179
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.</font>

180

designed actually works,</font>

181
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.</font>

182
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

183

when they're four years old.</font>

184

<font color="#FFFFFF">Why shouldn't you?</font>

185
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh, keep it down.</font>

186
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.</font>

187
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.</font>

188
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">lmportant enough for the likes of you.</font>

189

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.</font>

190
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:44,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who, the lmp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.</font>

191
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jealous?</font>

192
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I be jealous?</font>

193
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.</font>

194
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a dwarf like down below?</font>

195
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always wondered.</font>

196
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?</font>

197
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.</font>

198
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:07,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Generous tipper.</font>

199
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.</font>

200
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are jealous.</font>

201
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Greyjoy.</font>

202

<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been lords
of the Iron lslands for 300 years.</font>

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,</font>

204
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">not even the Lannisters.</font>

205
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about the Starks?</font>

206
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.</font>

207
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">A ward -
that's a nice word for it.</font>

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">My father fought
for the freedom of his people.</font>

210
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.</font>

211
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a very serious boy.</font>

212
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.</font>

213
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">A serious boy
with a serious cock.</font>

214
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to pay for it.</font>

215
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then get yourself a wife.</font>

216
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

217
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna hurt you.</font>

218
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is your son, my lord?</font>

219
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never walk again.</font>

220
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his mind is sound?</font>

221
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they say.</font>

222
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blessing, then.</font>

223
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suffered an early mutilation myself.</font>

224
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some doors close forever...</font>

225
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">others open
in most unexpected places.</font>

226
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">May l?</font>

227
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,</font>

228
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">off comes my head.</font>

229
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who would mourn poor Varys then?</font>

230
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.</font>

231
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are things you must know.</font>

232
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -</font>

233
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">your friend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.</font>

234
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been in the capital a month.</font>

235
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?</font>

236
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't trust you.</font>

237
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why do you trust me now?</font>

238
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.</font>

239
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are few men of honor
in the capital.</font>

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are one of them.</font>

241
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to believe I am another,
strange as that may seem.</font>

242
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of doom does the king face?</font>

243
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:40,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same sort as Jon Arryn.</font>

244
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tears of lys, they call it.</font>

245
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rare and costly thing,</font>

246
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.</font>

247
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gave it to him?</font>

248
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?</font>

249
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:09,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.</font>

250
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was one boy.</font>

251
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.</font>

252
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">The squire, Ser Hugh?</font>

253
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity, what happened to him,</font>

254
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.</font>

255
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Ser Hugh poisoned him...</font>

256
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">who paid Ser Hugh?</font>

257
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.</font>

258
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.</font>

259
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why kill him?</font>

260
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">He started asking questions.</font>

261
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's found
one bastard already.</font>

262
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has the book.</font>

263
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:22,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest will come.</font>

264
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?</font>

265
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods alone know.</font>

266
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fools tried to kill his son.</font>

267
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's worse -
they botched it.</font>

268
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.</font>

269
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?</font>

270
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not ready.</font>

271
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">if one Hand can die,
why not a second?</font>

272
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:49,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Hand is not the other.</font>

273
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need time.</font>

274
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.</font>

275
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.</font>

276
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Move fast," I reply.</font>

277
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no longer
a game for two players.</font>

278
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It never was.</font>

279
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first to arrive
and the last to leave.</font>

280
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,140

281
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,890

282
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have our qualities.</font>

283
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:40,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look a bit lonely today.</font>

284
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.</font>

285
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:45,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking</font>

286
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- business with pleasure.
- Am l?</font>

287
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.</font>

likes his boys very young, I hear.</font>

both equally important.</font>

is a subjective quality, no?</font>

prefers amputees?</font>

to accommodate that inclination.</font>

298
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">The logistics alone...</font>

299
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:38,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.</font>

300
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.</font>

301
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strictly speaking.</font>

302
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?</font>

303
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've often wondered.</font>

304
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.</font>

305
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we had been so close.</font>

306
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">But enough about me.
How have you been</font>

307
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">since we last saw each other?</font>

308
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?</font>

309
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.</font>

310
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.</font>

311
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Council business.</font>

312
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.</font>

313
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.</font>

314
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life</font>

315
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...</font>

316
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">to think a simple word to the queen...</font>

317
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.</font>

318
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:44,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you</font>

319
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">even more recently
than you have seen me.</font>

320
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you?
- Yes.</font>

321
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earlier today, I distinctly recall</font>

322
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.</font>

323
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that you under the bed?</font>

324
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not long after that</font>

325
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I saw you escorting a certain</font>

326
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">foreign dignitary...</font>

327
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Council business?</font>

328
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.</font>

329
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're from there yourself, after all.</font>

330
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?</font>

331
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to think we are.</font>

332
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can imagine my burden,</font>

333
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.</font>

334
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:27,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,</font>

335
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">turning right loyalty to the realm...</font>

336
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position</font>

337
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">where a simple word to the king...</font>

338
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you two conspiring about?</font>

339
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.</font>

340
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?</font>

341
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disturbing news from far away.</font>

342
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hadn't you heard?</font>

343
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off with you. No begging.</font>

344
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a beggar.
I live here.</font>

345
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?</font>

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see my father.</font>

347
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.</font>

348
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want your father, boy?</font>

349
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.</font>

350
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:38,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father is Hand of the King!</font>

351
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.</font>

352
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.</font>

353
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you</font>

354
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the ear to help with your hearing?</font>

355
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?</font>

356
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.</font>

357
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who did?
- I didn't see them,</font>

358
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.</font>

359
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard</font>

360
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...</font>

361
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something about the savage.</font>

362
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,</font>

363
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:19,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?</font>

364
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chasing a cat.</font>

365
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon, my lord.</font>

366
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.</font>

367
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.</font>

368
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!</font>

369
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Benjen send you?</font>

370
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall,</font>

371
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.</font>

372
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.</font>

373
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not why I disturb you now.</font>

374
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -</font>

375
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes him as much
my brother as yours.</font>

376
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.</font>

377
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are others riding too.</font>

378
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole city will know by tomorrow.</font>

379
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what?</font>

380
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best said in private, my lord.</font>

381
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:28,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. We'll talk more later.</font>

382
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jory, take her safely to her room.</font>

383
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.</font>

384
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.</font>

385
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:48,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?</font>

386
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fear on that count, little lady.</font>

387
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.</font>

388
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's taken the lmp.</font>

389
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're far from home, Lady Stark.</font>

390
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.</font>

391
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.</font>

392
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask, my lady,</font>

393
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">why he is with you?</font>

394
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there was no time.</font>

395
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.</font>

396
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister will decide what he looks like.</font>

397
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, my lady.
She will at that.</font>

398
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.</font>

399
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,</font>

400
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll impregnate the bitch.</font>

401
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you.</font>

402
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested</font>

403
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.</font>

404
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:21,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to see the king first - alone.</font>

405
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.</font>

406
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has summoned you.</font>

407
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.</font>

408
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.</font>

409
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.</font>

410
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.</font>

411
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.</font>

412
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hear it now.</font>

413
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.</font>

414
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that fool Viserys as well.</font>

415
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.</font>

416
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.</font>

417
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honor?
I've got seven kingdoms to rule!</font>

418
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">One king, seven kingdoms.</font>

419
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think honor keeps them in line?</font>

420
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?</font>

421
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.</font>

422
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl</font>

423
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the spider heard a rumor?</font>

424
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No rumor, my lord.
The princess is with child.</font>

425
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.</font>

426
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.</font>

427
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mormont?
You bring us the whispers</font>

428
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?</font>

429
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jorah Mormont's a slaver,
not a traitor.</font>

430
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.</font>

431
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:41,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.</font>

432
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We commit murder
on the word of this man?</font>

433
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he's right?
if she has a son?</font>

434
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -</font>

435
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.</font>

436
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:59,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.</font>

437
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do nothing?</font>

438
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your wise advice?</font>

439
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?</font>

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my council.
Counsel!</font>

441
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak sense to this honorable fool.</font>

442
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand your misgivings, my lord.</font>

443
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing</font>

444
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">we must consider, a vile thing.</font>

445
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet we who presume to rule</font>

446
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">must sometimes do vile things</font>

447
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the good of the realm.</font>

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,</font>

449
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:36,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,</font>

450
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:40,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?</font>

451
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many towns will burn?</font>

452
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it not wiser, kinder even,</font>

453
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:51,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?</font>

454
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have had them
both killed years ago.</font>

455
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,</font>

456
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">best close your eyes,
get it over with.</font>

457
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut her throat.
Be done with it.</font>

458
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:12,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I followed you into war -</font>

459
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">twice,</font>

460
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">without doubts,</font>

461
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">without second thoughts.</font>

462
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I will not follow you now.</font>

463
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Robert I grew up with</font>

464
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,130

of an unborn child.</font>

465

466
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have no part in it.</font>

467

<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.</font>

469
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And good luck to him.</font>

470
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:56,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.</font>

471
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done with you.</font>

472
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, run back to Winterfell!</font>

473
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have your head on a spike!</font>

474
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll put it there myself, you fool!</font>

475
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're too good for this?</font>

476
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too proud and honorable?
This is a war!</font>

477
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.</font>

478
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.</font>

479
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish is here for you.</font>

480
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Grace went on about you
at some length</font>

481
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.</font>

- When do you return to Winterfell?</font>

483

- if you're still here come nightfall,</font>

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.</font>

485
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,539

486
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have the time.</font>

487
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.</font>

488

<font color="#FFFFFF">Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.</font>

- Heward and Wyl.</font>

490

491
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bring him here without permission?</font>

492
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pollute my home with his presence?</font>

493
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.</font>

494
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember her, don't you?</font>

495
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't he beautiful?</font>

496
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">And strong too. Jon knew it.</font>

497
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">His last words were
"The seed is strong."</font>

498
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy</font>

499
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">his son would grow up to be.</font>

500
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,260

the lord of all the Vale.</font>

501
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:48,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lysa,</font>

502
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,139

- It is.</font>

507

<font color="#FFFFFF">He's little.</font>

508
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's Tyrion the lmp,
of House Lannister.</font>

509
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!</font>

510
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, did I kill him too?</font>

511
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!</font>

512
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men are knights of the Vale.</font>

513
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.</font>

514
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every one of them would die for me.</font>

515

<font color="#FFFFFF">if any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.</font>

516
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!</font>

517
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.</font>

518
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.</font>

519
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will hurt my baby.</font>

520
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mummy...</font>

521
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see the bad man fly.</font>

522
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">my sister's guest is weary.</font>

526
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him down below
so he can rest.</font>

527
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">lntroduce him to Mord.</font>

528
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go sleep, dwarf man.</font>

529
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sleep good, little dwarf man!</font>

530
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.</font>

531
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.</font>

532
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.</font>

533
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.</font>

534
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.</font>

535
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.</font>

536
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you.</font>

537
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.</font>

538
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.</font>

539
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and you're not?</font>

540
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?</font>

541
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many wars have you fought in?</font>

542
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:37,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armor of yours?</font>

543
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold still.</font>

544
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,</font>

545
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">how I squirm at the sight of blood.</font>

546
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.</font>

547
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!</font>

548
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.</font>

549
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.</font>

550
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.</font>

551
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good because I work at it -</font>

552
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.</font>

553
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could work at fighting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.</font>

554
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.</font>

555
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.</font>

556
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:25,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how did it end up?</font>

557
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.</font>

558
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert's rather tasteless about it.</font>

559
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:36,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.</font>

560
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.</font>

561
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.</font>

562
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:44,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be</font>

563
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,</font>

564
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.</font>

565
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.</font>

566
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a lot more than you.</font>

567
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.</font>

568
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time we were out there
for two weeks.</font>

569
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:07,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,</font>

570
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.</font>

571
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. But Robert loves his killing.</font>

572
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:15,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And he's the king.
- Hmm.</font>

573
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.</font>

574
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he used to be good at it.</font>

575
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who should be king?</font>

576
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Be serious.
- I am.</font>

577
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father could be your bank.</font>

578
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never fought in a war before,</font>

579
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.</font>

580
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?</font>

581
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.</font>

582
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:42,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.</font>

583
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still my older brother.</font>

584
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Look at it.</font>

585
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.</font>

586
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a little spills.</font>

587
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.</font>

588
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to get used to it.</font>

589
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. Look.</font>

590
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:04,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">People love you.</font>

591
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.</font>

592
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to be near you.</font>

593
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're willing to do
what needs to be done,</font>

594
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't gloat over it.</font>

595
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't love killing.</font>

596
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:28,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?</font>

597
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?</font>

598
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would be a wonderful king.</font>

599
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.</font>

600
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seemed so good together.</font>

601
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.</font>

602
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.</font>

603
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.</font>

604
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

605
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not serious enough.</font>

606
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.</font>

607
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:24,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

608
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?</font>

609
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:30,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

610
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I do know this -</font>

611
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade</font>

612
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...</font>

613
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">we won't be able to stop them.</font>

614
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:50,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.</font>

615
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.</font>

616
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -</font>

617
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.</font>

618
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls my father wrong?</font>

619
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands</font>

620
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:13,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.</font>

621
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hole up in our castles.</font>

622
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wise move -</font>

623
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.</font>

624
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">They leave us in our castles.</font>

625
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">They go from town to town,
looting and burning,</font>

626
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall,</font>

627
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">stealing all our crops and livestock,</font>

628
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">enslaving all our women and children.</font>

629
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind</font>

630
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">their absentee king,
their cowardly king</font>

631
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">hiding behind high walls?</font>

632
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen</font>

633
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the rightful monarch after all?</font>

634
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still outnumber them.</font>

635
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is the bigger number -
five or one?</font>

636
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five.</font>

637
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five...</font>

638
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

639
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">One army - a real army</font>

640
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:15,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">united behind one leader
with one purpose.</font>

641
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our purpose died with the Mad King.</font>

642
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we've got as many armies</font>

643
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">as there are men
with gold in their purse.</font>

644
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:29,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everybody wants
something different.</font>

645
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father wants to own the world.</font>

646
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.</font>

647
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

648
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.</font>

649
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.</font>

650
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's all the realm is now -</font>

651
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">backstabbing and scheming</font>

652
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.</font>

653
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:04,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.</font>

654
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our marriage.</font>

655
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, so here we sit,</font>

656
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">17 years later,
holding it all together.</font>

657
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get tired?</font>

658
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day.</font>

659
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:34,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long can hate
hold a thing together?</font>

660
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:38,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, 17 years is quite a long time.</font>

661
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

662
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

663
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was she like?</font>

664
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never asked
about her, not once.</font>

665
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

666
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first, just saying her name
even in private</font>

667
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">felt like I was breathing life
back into her.</font>

668
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.</font>

669
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:13,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I realized
that wasn't going to happen,</font>

670
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I refused to ask out of spite.</font>

671
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.</font>

672
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.</font>

673
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.</font>

674
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why now?</font>

675
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:35,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us</font>

676
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?</font>

677
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know the horrible truth?</font>

678
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't even remember
what she looked like.</font>

679
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:58,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.</font>

680
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:03,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone took her away from me,</font>

681
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.</font>

682
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt something
for you once, you know?</font>

683
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:18,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

684
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:20,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even after we lost our first boy.</font>

685
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">For quite a while, actually.</font>

686
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?</font>

687
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

688
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that make you feel better or worse?</font>

689
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:56,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't make me feel anything.</font>

690
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks like him,</font>

691
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't she, my lord?</font>

692
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has his nose,
his black hair.</font>

693
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

694
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:22,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him when you see him, my lord.</font>

695
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.</font>

696
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.</font>

697
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.</font>

698
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want no jewels or nothing,</font>

699
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">just him.</font>

700
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:41,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king was always good to me.</font>

701
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Jon Arryn came to visit you,</font>

702
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.</font>

703
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,</font>

704
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">healthy.</font>

705
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks healthy enough to me.</font>

706
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl shall want for nothing.</font>

707
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,</font>

708
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've found.</font>

709
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whores rarely sink.</font>

710
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?</font>

711
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he has more than you, for a start.</font>

712
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many?
- Does it matter?</font>

713
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.</font>

714
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?</font>

715
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.</font>

716
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was overcome with fatherly love.</font>

717
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

718
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jory!
- My lord.</font>

719
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a small pack of wolves.</font>

720
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.</font>

721
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was the Hand of the King.</font>

722
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm not sure what he is -
lord of somewhere very far away.</font>

723
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the meaning of this, Lannister?</font>

724
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.</font>

725
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?</font>

726
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.</font>

727
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:40,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.</font>

728
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?</font>

729
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.</font>

730
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:50,210
