1
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little lord's
been dreaming again.</font>

2
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.</font>

3
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
if I was cooped up all day</font>

4
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.</font>

5
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.</font>

6
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:06,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't want to go.
- Neither do l.</font>

7
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,</font>

8
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.</font>

9
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor!</font>

10
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.</font>

11
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hodor.</font>

12
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say I received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.</font>

13
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.</font>

14
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not l, eh, boy?</font>

15
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not your boy, Lannister.</font>

16
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.</font>

17
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:46,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.</font>

18
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's true.</font>

19
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Bran.</font>

20
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember anything
about what happened?</font>

21
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has no memory of that day.</font>

22
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Curious.
- Why are you here?</font>

23
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?</font>

24
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.</font>

25
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.</font>

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean I did like to.</font>

27
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?</font>

28
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.</font>

29
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.</font>

30
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father will rejoice to hear it.</font>

31
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a gift for you.</font>

32
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.</font>

33
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must shape
the horse to the rider.</font>

34
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.</font>

35
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.</font>

36
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.</font>

37
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?</font>

38
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.</font>

39
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done my brother a kindness.</font>

40
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.</font>

41
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.</font>

42
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">There I'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.</font>

43
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't resist some northern arse?</font>

44
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you like Redheads, ask for Ros.</font>

45
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.</font>

46
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.</font>

47
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:28,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.</font>

48
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?</font>

49
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?</font>

50
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...</font>

51
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'lady?</font>

52
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your loyalty to your captors is touching.</font>

53
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel</font>

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?</font>

55
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.</font>

56
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.</font>

57
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.</font>

58
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.</font>

59
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.</font>

60
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose your father realized that
when your brothers died in battle.</font>

61
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.</font>

62
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Careful, lmp.
- I've offended you.</font>

63
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.</font>

64
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, don't despair.</font>

65
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father</font>

66
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've learned to live with it.</font>

67
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your next tumble with Ros is on me.</font>

68
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try not to wear her out.</font>

69
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoulder, legs.</font>

70
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leg, shoulder, leg.</font>

71
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Left foot forward. Good.</font>

72
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.</font>

73
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in seven hells is that?</font>

74
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.</font>

75
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them your name.</font>

76
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Samwell Tarly,</font>

77
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Horn Hill...
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.</font>

78
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to take the black.</font>

79
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to take the black pudding.</font>

80
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.</font>

81
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rast...</font>

82
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">see what he can do.</font>

83
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I yield.</font>

84
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, no more.
- On your feet.</font>

85
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick up your sword.</font>

86
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit him till he finds his feet.</font>

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.</font>

88
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!</font>

89
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, harder.</font>

90
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I yield!
- Enough!</font>

91
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">He yielded.</font>

92
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like the bastard's in love.</font>

93
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right then, Lord Snow,</font>

94
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.</font>

95
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two. Three of you
ought to be sufficient</font>

96
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make lady piggy squeal.</font>

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.</font>

98
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.</font>

99
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yield, yield, yield!
I yield.</font>

100
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done for today.
Go clean the armory.</font>

101
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you're good for.</font>

102
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well fought!
- Piss off.</font>

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.</font>

104
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can call me Sam...
if you want.</font>

105
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?</font>

106
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?</font>

107
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to.</font>

108
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just couldn't.
- Why not?</font>

109
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a coward.</font>

110
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.</font>

111
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. I'm sorry.</font>

112
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just... wanted to thank you.</font>

113
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bloody coward.</font>

114
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.</font>

115
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're too stupid to be a coward.</font>

116
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,</font>

117
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">before summer's over.</font>

118
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here!</font>

119
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah, hyah!</font>

120
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.</font>

121
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.</font>

122
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.</font>

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,</font>

124
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they're my people.
This is my army.</font>

125
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.</font>

126
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:27,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">if my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,</font>

127
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?</font>

128
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.</font>

129
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">They fear any water
their horses can't drink.</font>

130
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if they did?</font>

131
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,</font>

132
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the men
advising him are different.</font>

133
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,</font>

134
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">long ago.</font>

135
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Ned Stark wants my head.</font>

136
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">He drove me from my land.</font>

137
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sold slaves.</font>

138
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

139
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I had no money</font>

140
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:10,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an expensive wife.</font>

141
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where is she now?</font>

142
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">In another place,</font>

143
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">with another man.</font>

144
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?</font>

145
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call you the last dragon...</font>

146
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do.</font>

147
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have dragon's blood in your veins?</font>

148
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's entirely possible.</font>

149
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to the dragons?</font>

150
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was told that brave men
killed them all.</font>

151
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">The brave men didn't kill dragons.</font>

152
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">The brave men rode them.</font>

153
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization</font>

154
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">this world has ever seen.</font>

155
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,</font>

156
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.</font>

157
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">The swords of the vanquished,</font>

158
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">a thousand of them...</font>

159
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:18,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">melted together
like so many candles.</font>

160
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have always wanted
to see a dragon.</font>

161
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.</font>

162
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really. Why dragons?</font>

163
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can fly.</font>

164
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings</font>

165
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're somewhere else...</font>

166
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">far away.</font>

167
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they can kill.</font>

168
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them</font>

169
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:56,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">gets burned away to nothing...</font>

170
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. melted...</font>

171
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">like so many candles.</font>

172
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

173
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.</font>

174
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,</font>

175
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.</font>

176
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was not locked in.
I have seen things.</font>

177
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What have you seen?
- I've seen...</font>

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.</font>

179
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could</font>

180
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.</font>

181
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold</font>

182
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.</font>

183
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">have you seen one?</font>

185
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:47,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.</font>

186
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

187
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the last one died
many years before I was born.</font>

188
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what I have seen -</font>

189
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">their skulls.</font>

190
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.</font>

191
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was very young,
just three or four,</font>

192
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">my father used
to walk me down the rows</font>

193
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd recite
their names for him.</font>

194
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.</font>

195
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch</font>

196
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.</font>

197
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...</font>

198
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">they got bigger</font>

199
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">and bigger and bigger.</font>

200
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was Ghiscar</font>

201
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:41,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Valryon,</font>

the Seven Kingdoms</font>

210
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to the skulls?</font>

211
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

212
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.</font>

213
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scattered to the wind.</font>

214
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:30,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.</font>

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I buy you for?</font>

216
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.</font>

217
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">To, uh, teach your sister.</font>

218
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?</font>

219
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?</font>

220
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you pretty little idiot.</font>

221
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, then.
Get on with it.</font>

222
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.</font>

223
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,619

you will present your son to the court.</font>

- Gods be good,</font>

226
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.</font>

227
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I only have girls?</font>

228
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't worry about that.</font>

229

had five children - all of them girls.</font>

232
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:47,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you only had girls,</font>

233
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,730

to Prince Joffrey's little brother.</font>

236
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.</font>

237
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,029

a hundred times -</font>

- Maegor the Cruel.</font>

did it take to build...</font>

245
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?</font>

246
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.</font>

247
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,819

- Commonly known as the Mad King.</font>

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why were they killed?</font>

249
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,240

find it in your heart</font>

- No, I won't.</font>

I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.</font>

256
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,720

a tavern riot, a brothel fire,</font>

down the Street of Sisters.</font>

20 of my household guard</font>

268
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.</font>

269
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.</font>

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every inn
in the city is full</font>

271
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the whores
are walking bow-legged.</font>

puts coins in many a pocket.</font>

a great sadness to all of us.</font>

281

very hard and very fast.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">A book? What book?</font>

290
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.</font>

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,</font>

295
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">with descriptions
of many high lords</font>

296
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">and noble ladies</font>

297
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their children.</font>

298
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harkon Umber,
first of his name,</font>

299
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber</font>

300
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,</font>

301
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair</font>

302
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fair complected,
died in his 14th year</font>

303
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.</font>

304
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I said, my lord,
a ponderous read.</font>

305
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?</font>

306
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.</font>

307
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.</font>

308
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. did he say anything to you
during his final hours?</font>

309
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing of import, my lord.</font>

310
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.</font>

311
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.</font>

312
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.</font>

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does that mean?
- Oh,</font>

314
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:42,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.</font>

315
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:44,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all the weight they're given,</font>

316
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">last words are usually
as significant as first words.</font>

317
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?</font>

318
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else could it be?</font>

319
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.</font>

320
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I don't think it likely.</font>

321
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...</font>

322
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.</font>

323
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, women, cravens...</font>

324
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">and eunuchs.</font>

325
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?</font>

326
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.</font>

327
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">How that sort of person
found himself</font>

328
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.</font>

329
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honor.</font>

330
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

331
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find my own way out.</font>

332
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.</font>

333
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a hard fall down these steps.</font>

334
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:10,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.</font>

335
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.</font>

336
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says every swordsman
should study cats.</font>

337
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.</font>

338
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.</font>

339
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?</font>

340
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.</font>

341
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.</font>

342
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:42,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.</font>

343
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast</font>

344
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">or sit on the king's council.</font>

345
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:56,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.</font>

346
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I be lord of a holdfast?</font>

347
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.</font>

348
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.</font>

349
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:17,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm?
- No.</font>

350
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:20,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not me.</font>

351
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

352
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.</font>

353
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should warn you,</font>

354
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see all that well.</font>

355
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come stand by the fire.</font>

356
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.</font>

357
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not. You're freezing.</font>

358
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:19,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like high places.</font>

359
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:23,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fight. You can't see.</font>

360
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.</font>

361
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, Sam?</font>

362
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.</font>

363
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You're almost a man now," he said.</font>

364
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.</font>

365
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,</font>

366
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">"forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.</font>

367
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">"if you do not," he said,</font>

368
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">"then we'll have a hunt</font>

369
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble</font>

370
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.</font>

371
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Or so I'll tell your mother.</font>

372
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Nothing would please me more."</font>

373
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?</font>

374
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he is.</font>

375
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to get
any better, you know.</font>

376
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:31,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

377
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't get any worse.</font>

378
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:46,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you're reading a boring book.</font>

379
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmph.</font>

380
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.</font>

381
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?</font>

382
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not surprising.</font>

383
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.</font>

384
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.</font>

385
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knighted for what?</font>

386
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.</font>

387
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Ser Hugh?</font>

388
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.</font>

389
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see that boy there?</font>

390
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of Varys's little birds.</font>

391
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.</font>

392
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now look there.</font>

393
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one belongs to the queen.</font>

394
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?</font>

395
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.</font>

396
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?</font>

397
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.</font>

398
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:56,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.</font>

399
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send him to question Ser Hugh.</font>

400
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.</font>

401
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:05,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.</font>

402
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:08,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,</font>

403
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn</font>

404
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.</font>

405
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.</font>

406
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.</font>

407
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">..22, 23,</font>

408
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">24, 5, 6, 27,</font>

409
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?</font>

410
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">30, 31, 32...</font>

411
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.</font>

412
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.</font>

413
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm the captain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...</font>

414
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.</font>

415
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it just so happens that I am.</font>

416
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.</font>

417
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:10,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.</font>

418
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">They strut around
like roosters down here.</font>

419
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.</font>

420
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't be out here, my lord.</font>

421
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:23,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.</font>

422
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.</font>

423
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.</font>

424
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.</font>

425
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.</font>

426
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gendry!</font>

427
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is.</font>

428
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strong for his age.
He works hard.</font>

429
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.</font>

430
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.</font>

431
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, this is the King's Hand!</font>

432
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if his lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.</font>

433
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.</font>

434
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?</font>

435
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.</font>

436
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of questions?</font>

437
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">About my work at first,</font>

438
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:34,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.</font>

439
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:39,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then he started
asking me about my mother.</font>

440
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.</font>

441
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you tell him?</font>

442
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died when I was little.</font>

443
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had yellow hair.</font>

444
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd sing to me sometimes.</font>

445
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

446
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back to work, lad.</font>

447
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,</font>

448
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">you send him to me.</font>

449
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find anything?</font>

450
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">King Robert's bastard son.</font>

451
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes that.</font>

452
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is for the king from Lord Stark.</font>

453
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should I leave it with...</font>

454
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shhh. Listen.</font>

455
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear them?</font>

456
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?</font>

457
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guess.
- Three.</font>

458
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four.</font>

459
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes to do this when I'm on duty.</font>

460
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.</font>

461
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?</font>

462
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you wronged me?</font>

463
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.</font>

464
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.</font>

465
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

466
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.</font>

467
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.</font>

468
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.</font>

469
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:37,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stopped liking it at the end.</font>

470
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a proper battle.</font>

471
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?</font>

472
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.</font>

473
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:51,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.</font>

474
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.</font>

475
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:57,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.</font>

476
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!</font>

477
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me smell it. Come here.</font>

478
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.</font>

479
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't serve Lord Stark.</font>

480
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.</font>

481
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.</font>

482
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.</font>

483
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">lmpossible!</font>

484
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

485
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam's no different from the rest of us.</font>

486
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.</font>

487
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.</font>

488
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.</font>

489
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.</font>

490
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in love, Lord Snow.</font>

491
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You girls can do as you please.</font>

492
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,</font>

493
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.</font>

494
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:48,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one touches Sam.</font>

495
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?</font>

496
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attack him!</font>

497
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get in there.</font>

498
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit me.</font>

499
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, hit me!</font>

500
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I yield!</font>

501
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yield. Yield.</font>

502
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I yield.</font>

503
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think this is funny, do you?</font>

504
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:01,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,</font>

505
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you want a man at your back?</font>

506
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a sniveling boy?</font>

507
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You send this whore
to give me commands?</font>

508
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:25,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have sent you back her head!</font>

509
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.</font>

510
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hush now. It's all right.
lrri, take her and leave us.</font>

511
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Khaleesi.</font>

512
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why did you hit her?
- How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

513
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.</font>

514
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to invite you to supper.</font>

515
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- It's a gift.</font>

516
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?</font>

517
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.</font>

518
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">This stinks of manure. All of it.</font>

519
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Stop. Stop it.</font>

520
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?</font>

521
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:00,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.</font>

522
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:05,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!</font>

523
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...</font>

524
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!</font>

525
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the wife of the great khal
and I carry his son inside me.</font>

526
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next time you raise a hand to me</font>

527
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be the last time you have hands.</font>

528
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.</font>

529
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't doubt it.</font>

530
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?</font>

531
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:53,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?</font>

532
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?</font>

533
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:59,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?</font>

534
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.</font>

535
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

536
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm fat?</font>

537
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- But I like girls just as much as you do.</font>

538
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">They might not like me as much.</font>

539
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:21,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never... been with one.</font>

540
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've probably had hundreds.</font>

541
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

542
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a matter of fact,</font>

543
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the same as you.</font>

544
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, l...</font>

545
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:37,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find that hard to believe.</font>

546
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came very close once.</font>

547
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...</font>

548
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.</font>

549
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was she...</font>

550
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">old and ugly?</font>

551
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young and gorgeous.</font>

552
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">A whore named Ros.</font>

553
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:02,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What color hair?</font>

554
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.</font>

555
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And her, um...</font>

556
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her...</font>

557
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?</font>

558
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:14,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Better.
- Oh, no.</font>

559
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:21,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?</font>

560
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:26,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.</font>

561
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why is my surname Snow?</font>

562
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because...</font>

563
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're a bastard from the North.</font>

564
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never met my mother.</font>

565
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.</font>

566
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if she's living or dead.</font>

567
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...</font>

568
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">or a whore.</font>

569
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:59,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I sat there</font>

570
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.</font>

571
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I couldn't do it.</font>

572
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant</font>

573
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?</font>

574
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:24,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a good life for a child.</font>

575
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, mmm.</font>

576
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

577
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't know where to put it?</font>

578
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoying yourselves?</font>

579
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look cold, boys.</font>

580
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a bit nippy.</font>

581
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,</font>

582
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">indoors.</font>

583
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still summer.</font>

584
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you boys even remember
the last winter?</font>

585
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:03,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?</font>

586
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember.</font>

587
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?</font>

588
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,</font>

589
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">never mind how many fires
your servants built?</font>

590
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.</font>

591
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:21,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall</font>

592
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">during the last winter.</font>

593
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:28,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.</font>

594
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.</font>

595
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we went out to look
for some of his men -</font>

596
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">capture them,
gather some knowledge.</font>

597
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.</font>

598
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harder than you'll ever be.</font>

599
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:45,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know their country
better than we do.</font>

600
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">They knew there was
a storm coming in.</font>

601
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.</font>

602
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we got caught in the open.</font>

603
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wind so strong</font>

604
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:02,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.</font>

605
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,</font>

606
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">you lost a finger to the frost.</font>

607
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all in darkness.</font>

608
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know cold.</font>

609
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither of you do.</font>

610
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horses died first.</font>

611
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.</font>

612
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eating the horses was easy.</font>

613
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But later when we started to fall...</font>

614
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't easy.</font>

615
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?</font>

616
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:54,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soft, fat boys like you.</font>

617
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.</font>

618
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:04,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon we'll have new recruits</font>

619
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander</font>

620
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:10,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">for assignment,</font>

621
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:14,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,</font>

622
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you'd be fools to believe it.</font>

623
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're boys still.</font>

624
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">And come the winter you will die...</font>

625
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">like flies.</font>

626
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit him.</font>

627
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit the dragon.</font>

628
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.</font>

629
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.</font>

630
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.</font>

631
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:50,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?</font>

632
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:52,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

633
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the common people
are waiting for him.</font>

634
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">lllyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.</font>

635
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.</font>

636
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't care
what games the high lords play.</font>

637
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?</font>

638
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Home.</font>

639
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray for home too.</font>

640
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.</font>

641
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.</font>

642
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never take us home.</font>

643
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovers' quarrel?</font>

644
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Do l...?</font>

645
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sansa dear,
this is Lord Baelish.</font>

646
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.</font>

647
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:08,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known your mother a long, long time.</font>

648
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!</font>

649
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.</font>

650
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a child, I was very small,</font>

651
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,</font>

652
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you see,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.</font>

653
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been sitting here for days!</font>

654
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!</font>

655
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods, who's that?</font>

656
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ser Gregor Clegane.</font>

657
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call him the Mountain.</font>

658
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:50,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound's older brother.</font>

659
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.</font>

660
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was Jon Arryn's squire.</font>

661
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look how far he's come.</font>

662
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:02,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!</font>

663
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not what you were expecting?</font>

664
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?</font>

665
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:35,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely little tale of brotherly love.</font>

666
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hound was just a pup,</font>

667
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">six years old maybe.</font>

668
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gregor a few years older,</font>

669
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.</font>

670
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:53,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.</font>

671
00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:00,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -</font>

672
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:02,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gregor's toy,</font>

673
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:05,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">a wooden knight.</font>

674
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gregor never said a word,</font>

675
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck</font>

676
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">and shoved his face
into the burning coals.</font>

677
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Held him there
while the boy screamed,</font>

678
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">while his face melted.</font>

679
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't very many people
who know that story.</font>

680
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.</font>

681
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,</font>

682
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.</font>

683
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lord, Her Grace the queen.</font>

684
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.</font>

685
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.</font>

686
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -</font>

687
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">the ugliness with the wolves.</font>

688
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.</font>

689
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.</font>

690
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is Sansa?</font>

691
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:27,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.</font>

692
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Favors her mother,
not much of the North in her.</font>

693
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.</font>

694
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:37,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you hope to accomplish?</font>

695
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,</font>

696
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:43,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.</font>

697
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:46,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't change him.
You can't help him.</font>

698
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.</font>

699
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.</font>

700
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">if that's my job, then so be it.</font>

701
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just a soldier, aren't you?</font>

702
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:02,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take your orders
and you carry on.</font>

703
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:04,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it makes sense.</font>

704
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.</font>

705
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:10,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.</font>

706
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">As was l.</font>

707
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!</font>

708
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to you.</font>

709
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.</font>

710
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:42,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.</font>

711
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A song while we wait or...?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.</font>

712
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.</font>

713
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!</font>

714
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gods.</font>

715
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.</font>

716
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.</font>

717
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for myself, I don't
require a large room.</font>

718
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...</font>

719
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">.. to remedy this?</font>

720
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.</font>

721
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.</font>

722
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!</font>

723
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might I entertain you while you eat?</font>

724
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!</font>

725
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.</font>

726
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:35,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.</font>

727
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.</font>

728
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,190
