weight and made you feel ashamed?</font>

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I was just trying to do my job</font>

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a food critic, and
they all ganged up on me</font>

13
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">and said I was fat.</font>

14
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, why don't you
take me back to what happened.</font>

15
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in the locker room...</font>

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was in my underwear,
and these kids walked by.</font>

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I looked in the mirror, and
I thought I looked kind of ripped,</font>

18
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:16,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so I asked one of the kids if he
would take a picture of m-me, and he did.</font>

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I looked at the picture,
and I looked pretty ripped,</font>

20
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">so later at home, I put the
picture up on my Yelp account,</font>

21
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I typed in, "Don't I look ripped?"</font>

22
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:28,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought people
would be stoked on me.</font>

23
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:30,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then this morning, I saw
the comments on Twitter,</font>

24
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some people c-called me
names and said I wasn't ripped,</font>

25
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they said I was fat,
and I didn't have muscles.</font>

26
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:40,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Internet m-m-made
fu-fun of me and...</font>

27
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:46,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't
have put a picture of you</font>

28
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your underwear up on social media...</font>

29
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:49,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! You got a fucking problem, Mackey?</font>

30
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">N-no, P.C. Principal!</font>

31
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because body shaming is fucking serious,</font>

32
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm not gonna allow
that shit in my school!</font>

33
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody should have to
feel that kind of shame.</font>

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, sir, looks like
your total is $37.83.</font>

35
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:10,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

36
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, and would you like
to add a dollar donation</font>

37
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:15,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help hungry kids around the world?</font>

38
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:17,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, no, th-that's okay.</font>

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry?
- I'm... I'm good.</font>

40
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:22,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, you don't want to
give the dollar to hungry kids?</font>

41
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:24,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not today, thank you.
- Okay, no problem.</font>

42
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Window's gonna come up and ask
if you're helping the hungry kids.</font>

43
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just hit "No, I'm not."
- Oh, come on.</font>

44
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:32,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try hitting it again.</font>

45
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the box below the one that says,</font>

46
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:36,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sure, I'd love to help however I can."</font>

47
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, darn thing. Sorry.</font>

48
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most people give the dollar.
I can do this manually.</font>

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I give money to
charity a lot, okay?</font>

50
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure you do.</font>

51
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do! I just don't want to
every time I shop for food.</font>

52
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's completely understandable.</font>

53
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Have customer speak
on the"... Oh, okay.</font>

54
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can just speak into
the voice decoder and say,</font>

55
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm not giving anything
to the hungry kids."</font>

56
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not giving anything
to the hungry kids.</font>

57
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's got it.</font>

58
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, with the ice cream,
the vodka, pizza pockets,</font>

59
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:10,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nothing for hungry
kids, that's $37.83.</font>

60
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't forget your change.</font>

61
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if I gave money every time I
went grocery shopping, I would be...</font>

62
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please.</font>

63
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dick.</font>

64
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in, Kyle. Have
a seat right there.</font>

65
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably heard that Eric here has
been dealing with some body shaming.</font>

66
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

67
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Eric and I have been talking,</font>

68
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we've decided it's probably best
for him to get off of social media.</font>

69
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, probably.</font>

70
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what we're looking
for is a student volunteer.</font>

71
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:39,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody who can put the things Eric
wants up on the Internet for him,</font>

72
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:43,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">and also filter through all the comments
and make it more of a safe space for him.</font>

73
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

74
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said you were perfect
because you're really good</font>

75
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">at getting all your
schoolwork done on time,</font>

76
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">s-s-so you'd probably
do a really good job.</font>

77
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to run Cartman's
Twitter and Yelp account</font>

78
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">and only give him the good comments?</font>

79
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:57,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right.
- No.</font>

80
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, you know what
body shaming is, right?</font>

81
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much it can hurt someone's life?</font>

82
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do is
check out all the comments,</font>

83
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:06,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">type out just the positive ones,
and give that to Eric on paper.</font>

84
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he doesn't like what
people say on Twitter,</font>

85
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">he can get off.</font>

86
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:14,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Kyle, well maybe you'd
like two weeks detention instead.</font>

87
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me... Give me detention.</font>

88
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'll take the detention.</font>

89
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's two weeks detention for
you, bud. I'll see you at 4:00.</font>

90
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:25,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when we said someone
should probably help Eric</font>

91
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">by filtering out any negative comments,</font>

92
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">he mentioned you by name.</font>

93
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a joke?</font>

94
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a joke!</font>

95
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing funny about this, Testaberger.</font>

96
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a big problem in our country.
- I'm not doing it.</font>

97
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's two weeks detention
for you. Congratulations.</font>

98
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so any comments
that seem inappropriate</font>

99
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">or hurtful in any
way, you need to delete</font>

100
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not include in your
daily report to Eric.</font>

101
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted someone smart and hardworking!</font>

102
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I gotta?
- You want detention?</font>

103
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I get detention,
I'll get grounded.</font>

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you start today.</font>

105
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, it's your job to make
sure Eric has a safe space.</font>

106
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry!</font>

107
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, my... my fault.</font>

108
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?</font>

109
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where I come
for lunch every day.</font>

110
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to eat healthy to stay fit.</font>

111
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. It's that guy.</font>

112
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how are you today, sir?</font>

113
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

114
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, listen, before you ring me up,</font>

115
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to let you know</font>

116
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna be giving
extra money to charity,</font>

117
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">so can we... can we just skip that part?</font>

118
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no problem, sir.</font>

119
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've updated the system so
it's a lot more streamlined now.</font>

120
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find everything you need today?</font>

121
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, thanks.</font>

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go, and that's...</font>

123
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, and would you like to give
a dollar to hungry kids today?</font>

124
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I said no before.
- Oh, that's right.</font>

125
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, there's a picture
of a little hungry boy.</font>

126
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you just press on his belly?</font>

127
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Owww! Owwwww!</font>

128
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's got it.</font>

129
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:49,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, with the no help for
hungry kids, that's $18.87.</font>

130
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of $20...</font>

131
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your change is right there.</font>

132
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:56,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pull out the sandwich
out of the little girl's mouth.</font>

133
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not streamlined.</font>

134
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the new change dispenser, sir.</font>

135
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I-I can't...</font>

136
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she's a hungry
one. You got to pull hard.</font>

137
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sandwich isn't coming out.</font>

138
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:10,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try putting your foot on her face.</font>

139
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

140
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:19,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice day, sir!</font>

141
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was having a nice day.</font>

142
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:25,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, hold up.</font>

143
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are. You have
my social-media comments?</font>

144
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, right here.</font>

145
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:30,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just finished this morning.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought me having
someone edit my social media</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Leslie, put a fucking sock in it!</font>

160
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a guest speaker today</font>

161
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">who will challenge our

162
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:09,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, please welcome action

163
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a problem with me?</font>

164
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your worst nightmare.</font>

165
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no fear of death.</font>

166
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">More important, I don't fear life.</font>

167
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a big action-movie star,</font>

168
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:33,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">and people are pretty stoked on me.</font>

169
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I put a picture of
myself up on the Internet,</font>

170
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I had my shirt off, and I said,</font>

171
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:45,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Do you think I'm ripped?"
and some people commented</font>

172
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">saying I didn't look
ripped, that I was fat,</font>

173
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they called me Steven SeBoomBoom,</font>

174
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:53,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so then I put another
picture on the Internet,</font>

175
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I thought people
would be stoked on me,</font>

176
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they said I looked like a fat turd,</font>

177
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they said I wasn't buff.</font>

178
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:04,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Body shaming isn't cool,</font>

179
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,721

you on the Internet,</font>

180
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to make sure that you stay...</font>

181
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay strong,</font>

182
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell everyone you're proud

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

188
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:38,154

doing for Eric Cartman.</font>

really don't have time.</font>

193
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,988

to come to your school</font>

00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:25,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reality? Who let him in? Shit!</font>

442
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:26,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our hope is that with your donation...</font>

443
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:27,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, nice wine, huh?</font>

444
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think of that?</font>

445
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think
of your pretty flowers?</font>

446
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go! How do you like that?</font>

447
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:35,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, buddy, let's go.</font>

448
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:36,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shit on all of you!</font>

449
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seagal!</font>

450
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you fuck you fuck
you fuck you fuck you!</font>

451
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:42,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that, you stupid bitch.</font>

452
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:44,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a lovely charity event.
I suppose you're all feeling</font>

453
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty good about yourselves, hmmm?</font>

454
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

455
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've raised $300 by spending $500,000</font>

456
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Filet Mignon and crystal glasses.</font>

457
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:55,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you. Vin Dipshit</font>

458
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say fat shaming is wrong,</font>

459
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in response you show off your abs.</font>

460
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one fat shaming, idiot!</font>

461
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter with you people?</font>

462
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:05,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sad that people are mean?</font>

463
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:09,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sorry, the world isn't
one big liberal-arts college campus!</font>

464
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">We eat too much. We take our
spoiled lives for granted.</font>

465
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel a little bad about it sometimes.</font>

466
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you want to put all
your shit up on the Internet</font>

467
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:17,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">And have every single
person say, "Hooray for you!"</font>

468
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you. You're all pricks.</font>

469
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've got news for you.</font>

470
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you've been sitting
here trying to feel good,</font>

471
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:27,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">the little boy who sucked all
your shit is about to die from it!</font>

472
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

473
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

474
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have we done?</font>

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. I-I didn't even think...</font>

476
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess... I asked too much of one kid.</font>

477
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, everybody...</font>

478
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's a way to try
and make this right for everyone.</font>

479
00:20:56,896 --> 00:21:01,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">To date, Shameless America
has raised over $40,000.</font>

480
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">With that money, we are
putting more and more iPads</font>

481
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:08,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Into these people's hands.</font>

482
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:11,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">With iPads, these people can
finally help more Americans</font>

483
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get rid of negativity
on their social media.</font>

484
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thanks, Jo Jo.</font>

485
00:21:16,282 --> 00:21:18,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm shame-free now, and you can be too.</font>

486
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:21,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">For just $1 a day, one of
these beautiful children</font>

487
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:25,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will protect you from trolls and
make your Internet a safe space.</font>

488
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't rest until America
is completely shameless.</font>

489
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world can be brutal.</font>

490
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:33,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Shameless America is
going to continue to take steps</font>

491
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make sure everyone
has a safe space forever.</font>

492
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure this is a good idea?</font>

493
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>
