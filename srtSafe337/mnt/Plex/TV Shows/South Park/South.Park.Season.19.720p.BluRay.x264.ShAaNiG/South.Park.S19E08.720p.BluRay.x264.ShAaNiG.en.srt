<font color="#FFFFFF">Broflovski!</font>

20
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it you?</font>

21
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:11,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was what me, sir?</font>

22
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:14,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just saw a copy of
the school newspaper</font>

23
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:16,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">in which a student
used the word "retarded"</font>

24
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy.</font>

25
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">The word retarded does
not belong in our school!</font>

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is in charge of the school paper?</font>

27
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I'm about to
break their fucking legs!</font>

28
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, he's in charge of the school paper.</font>

29
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?</font>

30
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:43,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, uh, I-I guess we
haven't formally met before.</font>

31
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:45,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, the reason I need
to talk with you, Jason,</font>

32
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:46,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">is because of a very important...</font>

33
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:49,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Jimmy, actually. My
name is Jimmy, PC Principal.</font>

34
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Jim, thank you.</font>

35
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to talk to you today
about the use of the "R" word</font>

36
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your school paper.</font>

37
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, the "R" word is very bad.</font>

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says who?</font>

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says me, all right?</font>

40
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know a thing or two about the
rights of people with disabilities.</font>

41
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you use the "R" word to describe</font>

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">the school's lunch policy,
it can hurt people's hearts.</font>

43
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:10,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you understand that at all?</font>

44
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was an Op-Ed piece in the
paper written by a first grader</font>

45
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:14,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">who found the school lunch
policy to be ridiculous,</font>

46
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he thought "r-retarded" to
be the best word to describe it.</font>

47
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the editor of the paper,
I didn't think it was right</font>

48
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">to censor the words the student used.</font>

49
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, from now on,
I'm gonna need to approve</font>

50
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:27,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">the school paper before
you hand it out, okay?</font>

51
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

52
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you say?</font>

53
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're new here, so you don't understand</font>

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">how seriously I take my job
as editor of the school paper.</font>

55
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't allow ads, and
I don't allow anything</font>

56
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">that might t-t-taint the truth
behind what people are thinking.</font>

57
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want people
to be afraid of words</font>

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it stops them from having a dialogue.</font>

59
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:43,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't want to get angry, okay?</font>

60
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Are you uncomfortable
around people with disabilities?</font>

61
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay. Lots of people are.</font>

62
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:50,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not! I am
very not uncomfortable.</font>

63
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look... Unless
I can approve your paper,</font>

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is not being distributed
on campus. You got that?</font>

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hand out the
school paper in school?</font>

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not unless it is approved
by me. Do you understand?</font>

67
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. Got it.</font>

68
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget to read the school paper,</font>

69
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">now delivered directly to your door!</font>

00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Super School News!</font>

71
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that, bro?</font>

72
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:50,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">S-S-S-S-Suck my
dick, PC Principal!</font>

73
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who does this kid think
he is, challenging me?</font>

74
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said one microaggression to him, okay?</font>

75
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">One little microaggression,
but that doesn't mean</font>

76
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:05,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an unconscious bias
towards people with disabilities!</font>

77
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:06,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way, bro. That's whack!</font>

78
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why would a person
with a disability not see</font>

79
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:11,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">that what I'm trying to do
is actually protect them?</font>

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes victims of
oppression are so marginalized</font>

81
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they begin to sympathize
with their oppressors.</font>

82
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:16,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, bro.</font>

83
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">This kid just needs to be
shown he's being an Uncle Able.</font>

85
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can also count on my PC
frat brothers to have my back.</font>

86
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, PC!</font>

87
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">PC! Whoo!</font>

88
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

89
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, this is so great.</font>

90
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever read the
elementary-school newspaper, Linda?</font>

91
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:36,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no ads, no sponsored content,</font>

92
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:37,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">no links to click on,</font>

93
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:40,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">just news stories
about what's happening.</font>

94
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:42,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that the
police in ShiTpaTown</font>

95
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">beat up homeless to clear them out?</font>

96
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how long its been</font>

97
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">since I was able to just
sit back and read the news?</font>

98
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got so used to getting
news off the Internet,</font>

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I feel like I'm always
trying to chase the news, somehow.</font>

100
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I'm in a black void</font>

101
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:01,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to reach the news story.</font>

102
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then the next thing I know,</font>

103
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:04,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm reading and ad for GEICO,</font>

104
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I click out of that and
try to read the news story,</font>

105
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's not a news
story, it's a slide show,</font>

106
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:11,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm looking at the worst
celebrity plastic-surgery jobs ever.</font>

107
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, of course, I want
to see the next slide</font>

108
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:15,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">of plastic surgery gone
wrong, so I hit the arrow.</font>

109
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then the arrow wasn't
the arrow for the next slide,</font>

110
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was to take me for
an ad for face cream.</font>

111
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:20,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

112
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to get a news story,
but I'm reading about face cream,</font>

113
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:24,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I try to click out of it,
but the ad is following me.</font>

114
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... It's following
me all over the screen!</font>

115
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:27,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

116
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I click on the "close" button,</font>

117
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it wasn't a "close" button,
it was another slide show.</font>

118
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just want to know what's happening
in the Middle East, but instead,</font>

119
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at the top 10
scariest movies of all time.</font>

120
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's not the arrow for the
next slide, it's for another ad!</font>

121
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

122
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this... This is just news.</font>

123
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't get lost
in all the bullshit.</font>

124
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Linda.</font>

125
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:49,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Linda!</font>

126
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Jim, I know you've
been trying to get your head around</font>

127
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">some of the social issues
we discussed yesterday.</font>

128
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you're feeling confused
and a little unsure of yourself.</font>

129
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not confused at all,
actually, PC Principal.</font>

130
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, no, you are confused...</font>

131
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:01,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure you're the one
that's confused, but go ahead.</font>

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you don't grasp
the severity of this.</font>

133
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why I've brought in
another young person with disabilities</font>

134
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">to share his feelings.</font>

135
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming in
to talk to us, Nathan.</font>

136
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like apples and bananas.</font>

137
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too, bro. Me, too.</font>

138
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan, could you
tell Jimmy how you feel</font>

139
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">when people use the word "retarded?"</font>

140
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:23,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.</font>

141
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:25,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious right now?</font>

142
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel bad. Right.</font>

143
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel like that's
a no-no word, right?</font>

144
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">That word makes my heart piss its pants.</font>

145
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, wow. That's pretty heavy.</font>

146
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty heavy, huh, Jim?</font>

147
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:38,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to ask him
what he means by that,</font>

148
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are you just pandering</font>

149
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're uncomfortable
around disabled people?</font>

150
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not uncomfortable!</font>

151
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply care about a
horrible, outdated word</font>

152
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is exclusive,
ignores individuality,</font>

153
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and equates intellectual
disability with being...</font>

154
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it... and it...
Spot! I need a spotter!</font>

155
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spot me! Somebody spot me, bro!</font>

156
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's... it's part of
a derogatory hate speech</font>

157
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">which fosters isolation and loneliness,</font>

158
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:02,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">and being part of a
voice to stop the "R" word</font>

159
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:04,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not only right, but
extremely important!</font>

160
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid of bears.</font>

161
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Nathan. Hold up.</font>

162
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you doing in there?</font>

163
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you mad?</font>

164
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Nathan.</font>

165
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I both know you use the
word retarded 400 times a day.</font>

166
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jimmy.</font>

167
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">So righteous, aren't you?</font>

168
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:27,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">So blind to everything that's going on.</font>

169
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:28,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

170
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think all the
changes happening to this town</font>

171
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">are just coincidence?</font>

172
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:39,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">This goes so much deeper than
you can possibly imagine, Jim.</font>

173
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's about to learn the truth,</font>

174
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then... there's a war coming.</font>

175
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">A war, Jim.</font>

176
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm just gonna make sure
I'm on the right side of it.</font>

177
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, boys. Let's get back to class.</font>

178
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to smell trees!</font>

179
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:00,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">An elementary school
newspaper is making big waves</font>

180
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">as more and more people say
no to news on the Internet.</font>

181
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read Super School News
'cause it don't try and fool me,</font>

182
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:11,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">and its news reports aren't
paid for by ad companies.</font>

183
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just feel like this is actual news,</font>

184
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">and instead of clicking on
links, we're reading stories.</font>

185
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to get away from the ads.</font>

186
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt that the ads
were... evolving, somehow.</font>

187
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:24,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">They started knowing what I
liked, what I was afraid of.</font>

188
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried ad blockers, but
it seemed like every time</font>

189
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to block the ads,
they just got smarter.</font>

190
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm never going back
from Super School News.</font>

191
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young editor of the paper claims</font>

192
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">that since most people now watch
news reports on the Internet,</font>

193
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're easily distracted
or even fooled by ads,</font>

194
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">which are finding more
and more clever ways...</font>

195
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, brutal celebrity mug shots.
- To disguise them...</font>

196
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it got me.</font>

197
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ad got me, Sharon.</font>

198
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:54,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">We now return live to the
2015 Presidential Debates.</font>

199
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our next question is
for you, Mrs. Clinton.</font>

200
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many voters believe that
Syrian refugees should not</font>

201
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">be allowed into our country
for security reasons.</font>

202
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

203
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keeping our country safe has
become more and more difficult,</font>

204
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I believe there
are several things...</font>

205
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! You shut the hell up!</font>

206
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a dumpy butt and seven chins.</font>

207
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Syrian refugees are all terrorists!</font>

208
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:19,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that our government needs
to take a harder look at all...</font>

209
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, it's pretty
hard to look at you.</font>

210
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can all agree on that.</font>

211
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks like a donkey
took a shit on her face.</font>

212
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, good one, Caitlyn.</font>

213
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:30,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, what I know is
that there's only one way</font>

214
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:32,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deal with Syrian
refugees, and that is...</font>

215
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck them all to death!</font>

216
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:36,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

217
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:40,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was hilarious when
you called her a pizza face.</font>

218
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a Papa John's pimple party.</font>

219
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:43,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn.</font>

220
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:45,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the best running mate ever.</font>

221
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Mr. Garrison.</font>

222
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

223
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Principal Victoria?</font>

224
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations on the polls.</font>

225
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:56,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk.</font>

226
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Celebrate diversity! Whoo!</font>

227
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, PC!</font>

228
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone. Listen up.</font>

229
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight's a very special
night for the PCs.</font>

230
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're honored to be throwing this
event for people with disabilities.</font>

231
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:17,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, for one, am sick of
how these amazing kids</font>

232
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:18,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">are marginalized in today's society,</font>

233
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">but tonight is about
learning and healing.</font>

234
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's get to it! PC!</font>

235
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. I'm Brad.
I'm PC Arizona State.</font>

236
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you...</font>

237
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me a second. Hello, ladies.</font>

238
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:31,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming to our event.</font>

239
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:32,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi!
- Hi!</font>

240
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just tired of the way people
with disabilities get treated.</font>

241
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I get you some alcohol?</font>

242
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know, it just
bugs me when people refer</font>

243
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">to persons with
disabilities as handicapped.</font>

244
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:41,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I hear that word,</font>

245
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to fucking punch
them in the fucking face.</font>

246
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so cool of you. Wow.</font>

247
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, to be marginalizing
persons with disabilities</font>

248
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">by asking them what their handicap is</font>

249
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a microaggression no better
than asking a person of color</font>

250
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they went to college.</font>

251
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:54,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. You're really progressive.</font>

252
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">No other way to be.</font>

253
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:59,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, listen, I think you're
really pretty and interesting,</font>

254
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd kind of like
to take you upstairs</font>

255
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">and totally crush your pussy.</font>

256
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:03,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would that be acceptable to you?</font>

257
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, I-I guess it would.</font>

258
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm sorry. I need
affirmative consent.</font>

259
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need you to say, "Yes,
you may take me upstairs</font>

260
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">and crush my pussy at this time."</font>

261
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">McKenzie, you got consent forms?</font>

262
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Right here, bro.</font>

263
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise and shine, guys.</font>

264
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you scored last night,
I need your consent forms.</font>

265
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

266
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:33,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Whoa, Barker,
did you perform cunnilingus?</font>

267
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:34,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a different release form, bro.</font>

268
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, uh, s-sorry. It's right here.</font>

269
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

270
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:37,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro!</font>

271
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:39,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude! Bro!</font>

272
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, bro?</font>

273
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:41,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I scored with this female,</font>

274
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">and after consenting to
putting her mouth on my penis,</font>

275
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- she wanted me to walk her home.
- Yeah?</font>

276
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:46,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I got to her house,</font>

277
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">she had me meet her
father, who is Filipino.</font>

278
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:49,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I asked him if
he could tell me about</font>

279
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cultural and social dynamics
of being a Filipino American.</font>

280
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Naturally.
- So, he said some stuff,</font>

281
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then a newspaper
lands on his doorstep,</font>

282
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I guess her dad subscribes
to this school newspaper,</font>

283
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he picked it up, and I
saw the headline said this!</font>

284
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is this, bro?</font>

285
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, that little kid wrote
that our tolerant views</font>

286
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fight for social justice is
just a way for us to crush puss!</font>

287
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:08,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not true!</font>

288
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, bro! We're
being totally victimized!</font>

289
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little fucking dude!</font>

290
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. You're the boy responsible</font>

291
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the South Park Super School News?</font>

292
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:20,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

293
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">We would like to give you $26 million.</font>

294
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contracts and the first check.</font>

295
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd love to be in business with you.</font>

296
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this for?</font>

297
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I represent an
organization called GEICO:</font>

298
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an insurance company.</font>

299
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think Super School
News would be a great way</font>

300
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:45,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">for us to reach new customers.</font>

301
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:48,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Charlie, but I don't
allow ads in my newspaper.</font>

302
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:49,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've heard all about that,</font>

303
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we thought you could just do some...</font>

304
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">news stories about car insurance.</font>

305
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just state the facts</font>

306
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the truth is everyone
can save by switching to GEICO:</font>

307
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's called "sponsored content."</font>

308
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the difference
between the news and ads.</font>

309
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:03,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm stupid?</font>

310
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's doing it, Jim.</font>

311
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sort of the last holdout.</font>

312
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">$26 million just to
write some news stories</font>

313
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">that get people thinking
about their insurance coverage?</font>

314
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">S-S-S-Stick
it up your ass.</font>

315
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

316
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they said you'd be tough.</font>

317
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think you can stop ads?</font>

318
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

319
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:30,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can try to block
ads, but they get smarter.</font>

320
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more we try to shut them
out, the more clever they get.</font>

321
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:35,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a war coming, kid,</font>

322
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna make sure
I'm on the right side of it.</font>

323
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer Barbrady?</font>

324
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me if you want to live!</font>

325
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Come with me
if you want to live!</font>

326
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm serious!</font>

327
00:13:56,527 --> 00:14:00,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to explain to
me what pussy crushing is?</font>

328
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:01,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

329
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your little meetings you go to at
night to discuss social justice...</font>

330
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:08,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a way to
pick up on young women?</font>

331
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharon, most of the guys in my PC club
are right out of college, all right?</font>

332
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how college kids are.</font>

333
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wrote this?</font>

334
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you going
over there anymore.</font>

335
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:19,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't cheat on you, Sharon.</font>

336
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happy.</font>

337
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at what's happened to our town.</font>

338
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:24,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have ShiTpaTown,</font>

339
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">boutique restaurants, and artisan shops.</font>

340
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a fucking Whole
Foods, and that was all me!</font>

341
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diverse people are moving here.</font>

342
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's being aware of how they talk.</font>

343
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is paradise, Sharon!</font>

344
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:37,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it?</font>

345
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:40,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that you've changed.</font>

346
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since you joined this PC thing,</font>

347
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">you just bully people</font>

348
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wait for people to
say anything improper</font>

349
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you can jump down their throats</font>

350
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">for whatever words he or she used.</font>

351
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:55,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">"He or she" is an agenderphobic
microaggression, Sharon.</font>

352
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a bigot.</font>

353
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">The average human can no
longer tell the difference</font>

354
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">between the news and an ad.</font>

355
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to have some mental ability</font>

356
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">that allows you to know the difference.</font>

357
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does this have to do with me calling
the school principal a pussy crusher?</font>

358
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:28,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">The PC people are
simply being manipulated,</font>

359
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:32,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">unwittingly setting the table
for the new enemy of humanity.</font>

360
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean ISIS or ninjas?</font>

361
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something much worse.</font>

362
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:42,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever felt like
an ad had... intelligence?</font>

363
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">That it somehow knew what you wanted</font>

364
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">even before you knew you wanted it?</font>

365
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I were to tell you</font>

366
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">that ads have become smarter than us</font>

367
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now they're manipulating
everything we do?</font>

368
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.</font>

369
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was our own fault.</font>

370
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:01,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mankind became tired of ads,</font>

371
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:05,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we kept inventing ways
to make things ad-free.</font>

372
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We even created ad blockers.</font>

373
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when the ads had to adapt.</font>

374
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:14,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">They had to disguise themselves
as news in order to survive.</font>

375
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sponsored content?</font>

376
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really can tell the difference,</font>

377
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you could be the key
to saving our species, Jimmy.</font>

378
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to run a test on you.</font>

379
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sponsored content.</font>

380
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Test 17-B. Ready.</font>

381
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:35,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begin.</font>

382
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:38,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the news.</font>

383
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an ad.</font>

384
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the news.</font>

385
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an ad.</font>

386
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the news. That's
an ad. That's an ad.</font>

387
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the ne... Oh, wait.
That's an ad for cat food. My bad.</font>

388
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ. He's off the charts.</font>

389
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Increase the intensity.</font>

390
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the news. That's an ad.</font>

391
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">News. Ad. Ad. Ad.</font>

392
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ad. Ad. News. News.
Ad. Ad. Slide show. Ad.</font>

393
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:08,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a perfect score.</font>

394
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:12,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a very special child, Jimmy.</font>

395
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer "handicapped," actually.</font>

396
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have another child
here who is special, too.</font>

397
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:23,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know Leslie?</font>

398
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:31,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. That's good.
Everyone get inside.</font>

399
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:33,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything past here is safe space.</font>

400
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">No reporters, no harassment.</font>

401
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna figure this shit out.</font>

402
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that I don't
speak up for minorities</font>

403
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that I can crush pussy.</font>

404
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, neither, dude.</font>

405
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want social justice, and
now I'm being made fun of.</font>

406
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:53,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, bro.</font>

407
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're taking our incredibly
tolerant views and distorting them.</font>

408
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">PC people are under
attack. That's what this is.</font>

409
00:17:58,858 --> 00:17:59,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, yeah.</font>

410
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, we're the victims now.</font>

411
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, we're being marginalized.</font>

412
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, that makes us pretty cool.</font>

413
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll bet now we
can get a lot more puss.</font>

414
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:12,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Topher! It's not
about puss, all right?</font>

415
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:13,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is wrong with you?</font>

416
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're being labeled as meat heads</font>

417
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">who just want to crush puss
by an intolerant newspaper.</font>

418
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah fuck that dude, bro.</font>

419
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and, like, if
you're gonna belittle</font>

420
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make fun of PC people like that,</font>

421
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">then who's to say he won't do it to
other marginalized groups like us?</font>

422
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:28,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, this kid could
be the next Hitler.</font>

423
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:31,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you guys could stop
Hitler, what would you do?</font>

424
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rip that dude apart and then go home</font>

425
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">and totally smash some puss, bro.</font>

426
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Hell, yeah!</font>

427
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hell, yeah, dude!
- No!</font>

428
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look familiar. Don't
you go to my school?</font>

429
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy,</font>

430
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Editor in Chief of Super School News.</font>

431
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Leslie.</font>

432
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to finally talk to you.</font>

433
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they bring you in and
give you a bunch of tests, too?</font>

434
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the did. Do you know who they are?</font>

435
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they're ex-newsmen...</font>

436
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the men in suits who
used to be in charge of the news.</font>

437
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I recognized them.</font>

438
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">They told me I was special.</font>

439
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you special, too?</font>

440
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer handicapped.</font>

441
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:11,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that.</font>

442
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Principal Victoria, if
everything you've said is true,</font>

443
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">then why doesn't anyone know about it?</font>

444
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:18,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people who know,</font>

445
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:20,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they have to stay very hidden.</font>

446
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just having a hard
time swallowing all this.</font>

447
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And between me and this one over here,</font>

448
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:26,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can swallow just about anything.</font>

449
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:29,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, you're such an asshole.</font>

450
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired.</font>

451
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was replaced.</font>

452
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:37,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">This goes much higher than anyone knows.</font>

453
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:39,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to this town</font>

454
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:42,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">really thinking I
could make a difference.</font>

455
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been called a bigot towards
persons with disabilities.</font>

456
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:48,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been called a... pussy crusher</font>

457
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:52,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the behavior of a very
few individuals in my PC frat.</font>

458
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:55,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy Valmer is off
the school newspaper.</font>

459
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to take over.</font>

460
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy!</font>

461
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will be reviewing
your paper to make sure</font>

462
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">nobody is ever attacked
the way I was again.</font>

463
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:07,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this will be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.</font>

464
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy almost made me lose confidence,</font>

465
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I know who I am.</font>

466
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what I am.</font>

467
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude! Bro!</font>

468
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bro.</font>

469
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:17,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went online to read a news story</font>

470
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">about immigrants being
discriminated against.</font>

471
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Well, and so I clicked on the headline,</font>

472
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it turned out to
be an ad for Reddi-wip,</font>

473
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:25,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">so then I clicked on the "X"
button to make it go away,</font>

474
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then it was a link to another ad,</font>

475
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when I tried to cancel that,</font>

476
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">another window came up, and it was this.</font>

477
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what the fuck bro?</font>

478
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:33,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does this mean, dude?</font>

479
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, what the fuck, bro?</font>

480
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like our school, Jimmy?</font>

481
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yes, Leslie. I like
our school very much.</font>

482
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like our school, too.</font>

483
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like the kids who go there.</font>

484
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

485
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to wonder
something about you, Leslie.</font>

486
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to wonder about you.</font>

487
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:58,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you seem like a nice kid,</font>

488
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:00,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">but don't you feel like
you could be happier?</font>

489
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:04,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Holy shit.
- What?</font>

490
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:05,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you excuse me for a moment?</font>

491
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:08,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

492
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Jimmy? What do you think?</font>

493
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know she's an ad?</font>

494
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:15,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can spot them.</font>

495
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:20,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she kn-know she's an ad?</font>

496
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on, bro?</font>

497
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:31,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro?</font>

498
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?</font>

499
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're going back, remember...</font>

500
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know who we can trust.</font>

501
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they want to mess with my town,</font>

502
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:41,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fuck every last one of them.</font>

503
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:42,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this!</font>

504
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:46,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckle up, buckaroos!</font>
