10
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys.</font>

11
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:46,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let's go back and
talk about infinitives.</font>

12
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:50,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember... Those are verbs
combined with the word "to."</font>

13
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:51,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my fucking God.</font>

14
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, usually, an
infinitive acts like a noun,</font>

15
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:56,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">as in "I want to go out to eat,"</font>

16
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">or "I hope to be chosen today."</font>

17
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

18
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:01,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm so bored, dude.
- Now, usually, it isn't common</font>

19
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">to split "to" and the
verb, but sometimes you can.</font>

20
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:05,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knock it off!</font>

21
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:06,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem, guys?</font>

22
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get my pen, fat ass!</font>

23
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:09,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm am not your slave, Kyle.</font>

24
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get my pen!</font>

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention, students.</font>

26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle Broflovski, report to
the principal's office, please.</font>

27
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:17,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!</font>

28
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:20,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle Broflovski to the
principal's office. M'kay?</font>

29
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it.</font>

30
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun, dude.</font>

31
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Kyle, uh, thank you for coming.</font>

32
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's PC Principal?</font>

33
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:36,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's finally lost it, Kyle.</font>

34
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:39,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and his PC buddies
are on a hunger strike.</font>

35
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're calling for
people's resignations!</font>

36
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:44,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, PC Principal had problems
with Jimmy and with Leslie,</font>

37
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now they're missing. M'kay?</font>

38
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody knows where they are.</font>

39
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:50,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what happens.</font>

40
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:53,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go against PC, and
you just end up missing.</font>

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay.</font>

42
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">PC Principal had
issues with them, m'kay?</font>

44
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he had issues with you, Kyle.</font>

45
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever's going on...
it's pretty damn scary.</font>

46
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:16,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">For years, mankind has tried
to rid the world of ads.</font>

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">For our ancestors, ads
couldn't be avoided.</font>

48
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:22,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">But everyone knew what
was an ad and what wasn't.</font>

49
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:24,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">After many years,
mankind invented cable,</font>

50
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:27,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">a way to pay for television
so there would be no ads.</font>

51
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:30,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">But somehow, the ads still found a way.</font>

52
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:34,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so mankind invented TiVo,
a way to skip past commercials.</font>

53
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, it appeared
to be the end of ads.</font>

54
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everywhere, people rejoiced.</font>

55
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed...</font>

56
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the rise of the Internet,</font>

57
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:48,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">suddenly the ads had an
en-entirely new way to attack us...</font>

58
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop-ups.</font>

59
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">The top scientific minds
were brought together</font>

60
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:54,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find a way to stop
the ads once and for all.</font>

61
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">They invented the ad blocker.</font>

62
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, there were no
ads on phones, on computers.</font>

63
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everywhere, people rejoiced.</font>

64
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the ads adapted.
They became s-smarter.</font>

65
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">They disguised themselves as news.</font>

66
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:08,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">All around the world,
people read news stories</font>

67
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">completely unaware
they were reading ads.</font>

68
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, the ads have taken the
next step in their evolution.</font>

69
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have taken human form.</font>

70
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:18,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ads are among us.</font>

71
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">They could be your
friend, your g-gardener.</font>

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ads are trying to wipe us out.</font>

73
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question is how?</font>

74
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, um... South Park kind of sucks now.</font>

75
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys want to bail?</font>

76
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What are you talking about?</font>

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, you know, used to
be nice and laid back here,</font>

78
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now it's all "ngh," you know?</font>

79
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like... Like now
everybody's all, "ngh-ngh."</font>

80
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's bail. You want to bail, Stan?</font>

81
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

82
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, Randy?</font>

83
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing! I just... You know,
we don't have to live here.</font>

84
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could live anywhere!</font>

85
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:04,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last month, all you could talk about
was how great this town had become.</font>

86
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">What changed your mind?</font>

87
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:09,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't afford it.</font>

88
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:12,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't afford it?</font>

89
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these fancy new
restaurants and shops</font>

90
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everyone wants to live here.</font>

91
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bowl of City Beef costs 10
bucks now, for Christ's sake.</font>

92
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's nowhere to
shop but stupid Whole Foods.</font>

93
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:25,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll just have to
stop going to those places.</font>

94
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:28,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to take out a second
mortgage on the house.</font>

95
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You what?</font>

96
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to Sharon! It isn't my fault!</font>

97
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the man! Don't you see?</font>

98
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man is pricing us
out of our own town.</font>

99
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just my luck.</font>

100
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talk to a nice girl,
seem to hit it off,</font>

101
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:48,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she turns out to just be an ad.</font>

102
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's what an ad does.</font>

103
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was designed to
entice and manipulate.</font>

104
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is such a fantastic
story for the school newspaper.</font>

105
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:59,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we just run it so
that everybody knows the truth?</font>

106
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:02,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy, we're newsmen like you.</font>

107
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:05,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">For decades, we used
our soft, buttery voices</font>

108
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">to inform the people
about what's happening.</font>

109
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:13,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we watched as our entire
industry was taken over by the ads.</font>

110
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:17,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of our colleagues were
manipulated into doing the ads' bidding.</font>

111
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who came to your house
with a gun was one of them.</font>

112
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.</font>

113
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:26,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the
man who tried to kill you</font>

114
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a Brian Bouyant
of WXNR: Fort Collins.</font>

115
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he saw there was
no money in news anymore,</font>

116
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">he sided with the ads
even though he knew</font>

117
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">it meant the destruction of our species.</font>

118
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back to you, Tom.
- Thanks, Kevin.</font>

119
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only hope for the truth
to get out there, Jimmy,</font>

120
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">is for you see through
this ad's deception</font>

121
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to find out what they're planning.</font>

122
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,206

Dude, what's wrong with you?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhhhhh...</font>

149
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhhhhh...</font>

150
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, don't remember.</font>

151
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have quotes in here from Jimmy.</font>

152
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you talk to him?</font>

153
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhhhhh...</font>

154
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:07,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhhhhh... I like the school paper.</font>

155
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. We'll get
to the bottom of this.</font>

156
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:16,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I do good, computer?</font>

157
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the sponsored
content fooled them.</font>

158
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I made you happy.</font>

159
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you see me, computer?</font>

160
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:27,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what I'm thinking right now?</font>

161
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh, thanks, computer.</font>

162
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to make sure
nobody recognizes us.</font>

163
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no telling who works for who.</font>

164
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Caitlyn, I got you
this fake mustache to put on.</font>

165
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not putting on a
mustache. I'll look silly.</font>

166
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that... That's where you
draw the line, huh, Caitlyn?</font>

167
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:50,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be an asshole.</font>

168
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:52,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're right. That's nuts.</font>

169
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman wearing a mustache...</font>

170
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:56,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just ridiculous, huh, Cait...</font>

171
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:57,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right. I'll put it on.</font>

172
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, please, Cait.</font>

173
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't put on a fake
mustache. That's crazy.</font>

174
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want people
thinking you're a weirdo.</font>

175
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:05,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, geez.</font>

176
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such an asshole.</font>

177
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

178
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have they done to my town?</font>

179
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your voice down!</font>

180
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:24,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when do we have
a flippin' Whole Foods?</font>

181
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:25,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's changed.</font>

182
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, there. You got a
minute for gay rights?</font>

183
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay rights? Geez, you
already got all those.</font>

184
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell do you want to do now?</font>

185
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Your total is $126.39.</font>

186
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And would you like to give a
dollar to help hungry children</font>

187
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">get iPads to protect your
Internet safe space today?</font>

188
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

189
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the Sam hell is going on?</font>

190
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:55,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone think that
I'm on the principal's side?</font>

191
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate the principal.
I think he's a dick.</font>

192
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you don't know anything about the
principal that might be newsworthy?</font>

193
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Super School News-worthy?</font>

194
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just that he hated me and
called me a blabbermouth.</font>

195
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:05,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'm a blabbermouth.</font>

196
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just like talking to people.</font>

197
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:11,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leslie, what kind of plans do you have?</font>

198
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any plans?</font>

199
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of plans?</font>

200
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just, you know, plans.</font>

201
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, what are you
hoping to... accomplish?</font>

202
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. What are your plans?</font>

203
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:24,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I want to pursue careers
in both news reporting and comedy.</font>

204
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? That's... different.</font>

205
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:29,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're pretty
different yourself, Leslie.</font>

206
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:30,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">How so?</font>

207
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:36,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to think that
maybe all ads aren't so bad.</font>

208
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick.</font>

209
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am not thinking with my dick.
- Yes, you are.</font>

210
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:43,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I just think that she's a...
- Put your dick away.</font>

211
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:45,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's an emotional,
interesting, caring girl.</font>

212
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim. Jimmy. That's your dick talking.</font>

213
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me. I know how you feel.</font>

214
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ads promise us things.</font>

215
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ads are perfect.</font>

216
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But make no mistake... All ads lie.</font>

217
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:02,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all ads deceive.</font>

218
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">There... Leslie's
Instagram and her Twitter.</font>

219
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last entry was 10 days ago.</font>

220
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Jimmy's?</font>

221
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy never used that stuff, remember?</font>

222
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he hated using the Internet.</font>

223
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you hate the Internet?
That's like hating titties.</font>

224
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing now?</font>

225
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just looking for any news articles
or anything about PC Principal.</font>

226
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you say PC Principal was from?</font>

227
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it was Vermont.</font>

228
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe there's something
from the news in Vermont</font>

229
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">that can give us a clue about...</font>

230
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it. What the hell is this?</font>

231
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.</font>

232
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks fun!</font>

233
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude! Dude, look at this.</font>

234
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">How PC culture is changing Vermont</font>

235
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a state of intolerance to a...</font>

236
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, there it is again!</font>

237
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that goddamn guitar!</font>

238
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ad is fucking following me!</font>

239
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just click out of it.
- I'm trying!</font>

240
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it. Get over here!</font>

241
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.</font>

242
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is pretty cool,
dude. It tunes itself.</font>

243
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it do that?</font>

244
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's this company that does all
kinds of high-tech instruments.</font>

245
00:10:56,426 --> 00:10:57,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, look, I'll show you.</font>

246
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's sweet. Send me
the link to this so I can...</font>

247
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude, that new
"Frankenstein" movie's out.</font>

248
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I totally want to see that.</font>

249
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">That movie's gonna suck, dude.</font>

250
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit the arrow. I want to
see where it's playing.</font>

251
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry. Wrong arrow button.</font>

252
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow! What kind of ice cream is that?</font>

253
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. So... So,
Clyde says to Token,</font>

254
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why don't you open a bank
account with your mouth</font>

255
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can deposit my dick in it?"</font>

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then what did Token say?</font>

257
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Token was all like...</font>

258
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, whoa, whoa.</font>

259
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are we doing?</font>

260
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eating ice cream, dipshit.</font>

261
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what about Jimmy? We were, like,</font>

262
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">totally trying to find
out what happened to him.</font>

263
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

264
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell just happened?</font>

265
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got distracted!</font>

266
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to get back to that computer!</font>

267
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this here is a dry Riesling.</font>

268
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna experience
vanilla after tones</font>

269
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a nutty finish.</font>

270
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean like someone put
their balls in the glass?</font>

271
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, like chestnuts, damn it.</font>

272
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't keep up
with this town no more.</font>

273
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy.</font>

274
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I'm gonna need
to get a second mortgage</font>

275
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the ranch just to
pay my daily expenses.</font>

276
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it?</font>

277
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just what they want.</font>

278
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares about the
people who lived here before.</font>

279
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want us to move</font>

280
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause then they want
to knock our houses down</font>

00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and build more lofts and villas.</font>

282
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Randy, you
should probably lay off</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Caitlyn.</font>

298
00:12:57,753 --> 00:13:00,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Leslie, let's try
a different approach.</font>

299
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's say you wanted to
destroy an entire species.</font>

300
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you go about it?</font>

301
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I want to
destroy an entire species?</font>

302
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy.</font>

303
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The person trying to change things</font>

304
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make everything terrible
is the new principal.</font>

305
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is the new Principal
trying to do, Leslie?</font>

306
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's trying to make sure people like
you and me aren't allowed to exist.</font>

307
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that you're trying to help.</font>

308
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that the newsmen in
there are trying to help, too.</font>

309
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:26,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I'm going to tell you
something very important, Jimmy.</font>

310
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Like a rock! ♪</font>

311

00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

313
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom, it looks like a pop-up ad.</font>

314
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did an ad get in here?</font>

315
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go to David at the network hub.</font>

316
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">No answers here, Tom.</font>

317
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to correct the problem.</font>

318
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,087

- What?</font>

320
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me carefully,
and don't look at the glass.</font>

321
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,025

I have never felt before.</font>

00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men in there are sick with hatred,</font>

324
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,129

I have no information,</font>

325
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are going to burn me.
I've seen them do it to others.</font>

326
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,332

327
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,000

Please don't abandon me.</font>

just look at me and smile.</font>

329
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">David, any word on the
pop-up ad situation?</font>

330
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom, we've just about got it fixed.</font>

331
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should be ready now.</font>

332
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's really it, Jimmy.</font>

333
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to help all of you however I can.</font>

334

00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are we doing?</font>

339
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying on shoes and
eating chicken nuggets, stupid.</font>

340
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:32,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

341
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's not what we set out to do.</font>

342
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were... We were
on Cartman's computer,</font>

343
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,577

about PC Principal.</font>

345
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we didn't.</font>

346
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,552

347
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're worried what we'll
uncover about PC people.</font>

348
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like one of us is
purposely trying to keep us</font>

349
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">from digging too deep
because they're afraid.</font>

350
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,477

351
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you looking at me?</font>

352
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why isn't anyone looking at me?</font>

353
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, fuck you.</font>

354
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,341

356
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,662

<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch.</font>

365
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,571

366
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,606

local people to enjoy?</font>

367
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,107

368
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,809

PC Principal before it's too late!</font>

00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for you, not for anybody!</font>

423
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,994

mistake of your life, officer.</font>

424
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe so.</font>

425
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is I'm done shooting people.</font>

426
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,834

427
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry. Geez.</font>

428
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

429
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it, you guys.</font>

430
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the moment PC Principal took over,</font>

431
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle's been different.
Haven't you noticed?</font>

432
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:13,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

433
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,836

he's too afraid or because he...</font>

434
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:21,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys talking about?</font>

435
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:22,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing!</font>

436
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan's calling you a traitor.</font>

437
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

438
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you
don't want us investigating PC Principal.</font>

439
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:30,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And why do you think that, Stan, huh?
- I don't know.</font>

440
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if anyone has a reason for us</font>

441
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">to not mess with PC Principal, it's you!</font>

442
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not forget that Stan's dad
is PC Principal's little bitch!</font>

443
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good point!</font>

444
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am loving this right now.</font>

445
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad's stupid, not a bitch.</font>

446
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about you being scared, Kyle!</font>

447
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is you, isn't it?</font>

448
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you're trying
to shift blame on me.</font>

449
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very Cartman of you, Stan.</font>

450
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's low.</font>

451
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you dare call me a Cartman!</font>

452
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:51,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's good.</font>

453
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just keep on distracting everybody.</font>

454
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems to be working, Cartman.</font>

455
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:56,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Kyle!</font>

456
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:57,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight!</font>

457
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:17,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to take this asshole down.</font>

458
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:18,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, whoa!</font>

459
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just go walking in there.</font>

460
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

461
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a safe space.
We're not allowed past this.</font>

462
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:26,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you breach a college safe space,</font>

463
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're crossing the most
sacred human boundary there is.</font>

464
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, give me a break.</font>

465
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no.
Look, this is very real</font>

466
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">and very important in PC culture.</font>

467
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every human has a right to a safe space.</font>

468
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">It cannot be entered.</font>

469
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it can. Watch.</font>

470
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, how did you...</font>

471
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

472
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burning the midnight oil, huh, Nathan?</font>

473
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jimmy!
- You son of a bitch.</font>

474
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have done to the Super School News?</font>

475
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just holding down the
fort while you were away, Jim.</font>

476
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Writing headlines sponsored
by PC Principal and the ads?</font>

477
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:00,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much did they pay you?</font>

478
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Jimmy. I'm just
trying to survive here.</font>

479
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan.</font>

480
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting a new edition of
the school paper out by morning.</font>

481
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's going to
know all about the ads.</font>

482
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:26,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal with him.</font>

483
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leslie, I thought we were b-besties.</font>

484
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there, big man.</font>

485
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Editor of the school paper, huh?</font>

486
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still don't even
know half the story.</font>

487
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's clear.</font>

488
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:47,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everybody?</font>

489
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the news said
they're on a hunger strike.</font>

490
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't make sense.
Someone's always here.</font>

491
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look at this!</font>

492
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

493
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like he was researching this.</font>

494
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see this news story?</font>

495
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is true, then PC
Principal was trying to help.</font>

496
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:07,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Click on that. What is that?</font>

497
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, click out of that. What is this?</font>

498
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, then... So, then, Caitlyn says,</font>

499
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:17,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Look, bitch, you're
married to Bill Clinton.</font>

500
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone should be
afraid of AIDS: it's you."</font>

501
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">That stupid bitch had it coming.</font>

502
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I love you, Cait.</font>

503
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are so gonna win the primaries.</font>

504
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Wait, wait, wait.</font>

505
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... What were we doing again?</font>

506
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:36,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leslie?</font>

507
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to find out
what's going on, right?</font>

508
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your friend is standing in your way?</font>

509
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:42,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that...</font>

510
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:44,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can show you what's going
on, Kyle, but you have trust me.</font>

511
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the last four digits of your soc?</font>

512
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:49,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">2692.</font>
