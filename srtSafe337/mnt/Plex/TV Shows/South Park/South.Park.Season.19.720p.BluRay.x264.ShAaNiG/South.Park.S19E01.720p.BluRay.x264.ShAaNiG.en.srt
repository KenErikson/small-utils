00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think venezuelans
aren't americans, brah?</font>

151
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you want to
make fun of me?</font>

152
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! What seems to be
the problem here, gentlemen?</font>

153
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:13,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

154
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm p.C. Principal.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet, bros!
Texas a&m.</font>

159
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:22,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, I had no idea there
were like-minded individuals</font>

160
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this town
who defended social minorities.</font>

161
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should all hang out!</font>

162
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should totally
hang out!</font>

163
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should all
get a house together</font>

164
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And unite
our tolerant views.</font>

165
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fucking do it, dude!

P.C.!</font>

170
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how long do you think
this will last?</font>

171
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lasted about six years
last time.</font>

172
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:58,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got at least
5.9 years to go.</font>

173
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hey, cartman.
What's going on?</font>

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you going
to, uh, you know,</font>

175
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go do something
about this new principal?</font>

176
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already got
four days of detention.</font>

177
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want any more.</font>

178
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna start
following the rules.</font>

179
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this isn't you,
cartman!</font>

180
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, where's the eric cartman
we know?</font>

181
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">The eric cartman we know
breaks the rules,</font>

182
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he gets away with it,
just like his hero.</font>

183
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Who's your hero, cartman?</font>

184
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">tom brady.</font>

185
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

186
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what does tom brady do
after breaking the rules?</font>

187
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deny and subvert.</font>

188
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

189
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what —
what would tom brady say</font>

190
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he got caught
shoplifting?</font>

191
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:40,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">"everybody shoplifts.
Why are you coming down on me?"</font>

192
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!</font>

193
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're tom brady, cartman.</font>

194
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that new principal in there
is the football commissioner</font>

195
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying to dictate
his punishment to you.</font>

196
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what happens
when an invulnerable cheater</font>

197
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Comes up against
an elitist corporate dictator?</font>

198
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">A perfect storm of hypocrisy
that everyone in the country</font>

199
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has to deal with
for months on end.</font>

200
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:53,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!</font>

201
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, guys.
I'm gonna tom brady this thing.</font>

202
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!</font>

203
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna say —
I'm gonna say,</font>

204
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">"you're not giving me
four days of detention.</font>

205
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're only giving me one!"</font>

206
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!</font>

207
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:01,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, to hell with that.</font>

208
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:01,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're giving me
no days suspension!</font>

209
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I'm gonna go home
and fuck my hot wife,</font>

210
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's not even that hot,
and kind of looks like a dude!</font>

211
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!</font>

212
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:10,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, guys.</font>

213
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:14,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost forgot the lessons
that football has taught us all.</font>

214
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get around
these pesky rules.</font>

215
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, I'm going to need
your underwear.</font>

216
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:19,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay!</font>

217
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.
I think we did it.</font>

218
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, p.C. Principal.
How are you today?</font>

219
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing
in the faculty bathroom?</font>

220
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
I think you and I</font>

221
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got off on the wrong foot
the other day.</font>

222
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">By all means, please,
keep your dick out.</font>

223
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, I'm not going to accept
four days of detention,</font>

224
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're going
to apologize publicly</font>

225
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">For being so strict to me
and my friends at school.</font>

226
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck
are you talking about?</font>

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a request,
that's all.</font>

228
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you around.</font>

229
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you seem to have dropped
something, p.C. Principal.</font>

230
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:06,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

231
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, this is a little boy's
underwear.</font>

232
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, this is
butters' underwear.</font>

233
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

234
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C. Principal,
you have butters' underwear?</font>

235
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now...</font>

236
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh,
it's got you dna all over it.</font>

237
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">This certainly
doesn't look good for you.</font>

238
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to tell anyone
about this.</font>

239
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I think we have
an understanding.</font>

240
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:25,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capiche?</font>

241
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you just say?</font>

242
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean about keeping
your dick out?</font>

243
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">"capiche"?</font>

244
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're associating
italian-americans</font>

245
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">To intimidation tactics?</font>

246
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better watch
your microaggressions, bro.</font>

247
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:36,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">O-kay.</font>

248
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:36,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you don't
want to end up</font>

249
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the spokesman for subway,
do you?</font>

250
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just use a term</font>

251
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">That excludes women
from an occupation?</font>

252
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's back up.
Aah!</font>

253
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:49,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just say spokesman
instead of spokesperson</font>

254
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">When women
are just as capable</font>

255
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of selling sandwiches
as anyone?</font>

256
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you purposely
trying to use words</font>

257
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">That assert
your male privilege?</font>

258
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm sorry!</font>

259
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just trying to frame you
for raping butters!</font>

260
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think italian-americans
and women are less important?</font>

261
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, god!</font>

262
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dare to use words
that alienate</font>

263
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two communities of people
who have to deal</font>

264
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">With verbal biases like yours
on a daily basis?</font>

265
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I speak
with p.C. Principal, please?</font>

266
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
We got another one, guys!</font>

267
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right!
Bring him in, bro!</font>

268
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're ready!
Whoo!</font>

269
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

270
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, no,
I-I don't...</font>

271
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the pledges,
take a shot!</font>

272
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C.
All right, pledges.</font>

273
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're excited
you want to try and be p.C.</font>

274
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hope
you've got what it takes</font>

275
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">To join the most socially active
group in america.</font>

276
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whooo! Whooo!
Whooo! Whooo!</font>

277
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, there's still
some people out there that say,</font>

278
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">"what does being p.C.
Really mean?"</font>

279
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll tell you
what it means.</font>

280
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means you love nothing more
than beer, working out,</font>

281
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that feeling you get
when you rhetorically defend</font>

282
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">A marginalized community
from systems of oppression.</font>

283
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

284
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, let's go!
- Whoo, whoo!</font>

285
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yeah!</font>

286
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo-hooo!
- Whoo-hooo!</font>

287
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:14,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whooo!</font>

288
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:17,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's go! Yeah!</font>

289
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:34,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got home pretty late
last night.</font>

290
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:36,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">6:00 a.M.?</font>

291
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've joined
a social-awareness group.</font>

292
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:44,600

discourages the use of... Words</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">To grant respect</font>

295
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">To people who are victims
of unfair stereotypes.</font>

296
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got in at 6:00,
and now you're missing work.</font>

297
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been getting away
with horrible things, sharon.</font>

298
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having laughs
at less privileged people</font>

299
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thinking
it was harmless.</font>

300
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our group is... Trying to be
a civilizing influence,</font>

301
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where we discuss
and have meetings</font>

302
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">To better define
and reinforce tolerance</font>

303
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And acceptance
of all groups of people.</font>

304
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

305
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do they have booze
at these meetings?</font>

306
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

307
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:21,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">They serve refreshments,
yes.</font>

308
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:26,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman?</font>

309
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't beat him,
you guys.</font>

310
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C. Principal
is too strong.</font>

311
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do now?</font>

312
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing left to do.</font>

313
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to admit
I did something wrong,</font>

314
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my punishment
and move on.</font>

315
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not tom brady.</font>

316
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

317
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, if we all tell the police
what the principal did,</font>

318
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He'll be fired.
- Yeah!</font>

319
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No way.
- Why?</font>

320
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because p.C. Principal
is right, kyle.</font>

321
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are bigots.</font>

322
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:56,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's time
for us to grow up.</font>

323
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,174
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, you're a bigot.</i></font>

324
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can face my prejudice,
why can't you?</font>

325
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're two privileged,
straight white boys</font>

326
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have their laughs about things
we never had to deal with.</font>

327
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not
going to apologize</font>

328
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">For saying caitlyn jenner
isn't a hero.</font>

329
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, personally,</font>

330
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she's most likely
not a very good person.</font>

331
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:12,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Aah!</font>

332
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, believe me,
I know the struggle with hatred.</font>

333
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:19,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make ourselves
better people... Together.</font>

334
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:19,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, fat-ass.</font>

335
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:23,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more fat shaming, kyle.
Let's start a new chapter.</font>

336
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're never gonna call me
a dirty jew again?</font>

337
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:25,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

338
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:29,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to call you...
My friend.</font>

339
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck you.</font>

340
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:36,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we never realized
how bad he really was.</font>

341
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C.
All right, pledges, listen up.</font>

342
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations on making it
to the final cuts.</font>

343
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoo!
- Yeah!</font>

344
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!</font>

345
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's time
for the final test.</font>

346
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what you're gonna have to do
to prove you belong with p.C.</font>

347
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:59,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is go out there
and check someone's privilege.</font>

348
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally!</font>

349
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

350
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
I don't know what that is.</font>

351
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tofer, can you explain
check your privilege, please?</font>

352
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting someone
to acknowledge</font>

353
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their own
inherent privileges,</font>

354
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">And reminding them
to put them aside</font>

355
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order to better understand
another human's plight.</font>

356
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see,
there's still people out there</font>

357
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like brett fuckin' favre,</font>

358
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who think
that when we all stand up</font>

359
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">And applaud caitlyn jenner
at the espy awards,</font>

360
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can get away with
one of these bullshit claps.</font>

361
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called clapping, favre!</font>

362
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are you doing?
You washing your hands?</font>

363
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're either on board
or you're not, bro.</font>

364
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if he's gonna bring shame
on someone,</font>

365
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he can have
his privilege checked,</font>

366
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">And have a little shame
brought down on him!</font>

367
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to shame
brett favre?</font>

368
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

369
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause there's somebody
even worse now.</font>

370
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! What the fuck, dude?
What the fuck?</font>

371
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may be down, but I'm not out.</font>

372
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom brady's never out.</font>

373
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">you broke the rules!</font>

374
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, I broke the rules.
You're breaking the rules.</font>

375

<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.
You broke the rules.</font>

376
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke the rules how you
found out I broke the rules.</font>

377
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:22,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">yeah, you broke the rules!</font>

378
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the commissioner. I can
break the rules 'cause you guys</font>

379
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broke the rules before
but I didn't bust you enough.</font>

380
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 'cause you didn't
bust us enough</font>

381
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">For breaking the rules,
that doesn't mean</font>

382
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can break the rules
busting us now.</font>

383
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck both you guys.
I can do whatever I want.

Rules, rules...</font>

00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here, eric.</font>

392
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, butters.</font>

393
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lived
such a horrible life,</font>

394
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always doing

395
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">And claiming it

396
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters?</font>

397
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:51,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, eric?</font>

398
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm never going back
to the person I was.</font>

399
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to god.</font>

400
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">From now on,
the world is going to know</font>

401
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,490

403
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what happened?</font>

404
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad was on my lawn
yelling at me all night,</font>

405
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after I finally
fell asleep,</font>

406
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I woke up saran-wrapped
to a tree</font>

407
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">With penises

408
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:22,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this.</font>

409
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

410
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, did you draw dicks
on my friend's face?</font>

411
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I check his privilege?
Yes.</font>

412
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had some refreshments,</font>

413
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I checked
your friend's privilege.</font>

414
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my best friend, dad.</font>

415
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop shaming him
because you want to fit in.</font>

416
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, straight white males

421
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, kyle,
maybe you should just say</font>

422
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caitlyn jenner
is a hero.</font>

423
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,119

she wasn't a hero!</font>

424
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just said
she isn't a hero to me!</font>

425
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:06,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't like bruce jenner

00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's no use, butters.</font>

432
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to get out there</font>

433
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">And start making
positive changes,</font>

434
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,672

438
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:27,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of nice.</font>

439
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:30,747

00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:35,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well — well, now they've made
kyle their main target.</font>

443
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle?</font>

444
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend kyle?</font>

445
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric,
what are you doing?</font>

446
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a choice.</font>

447
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to take
these p.C. People out.</font>

448
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but I thought
you agreed with them.</font>

449
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:55,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do,
but I have to help kyle</font>

450
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if I don't agree with
his hateful, bigoted thoughts.</font>

451
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle's view
may be warped.</font>

452
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I personally think
caitlyn jenner's
a stunning hero.</font>

453
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that doesn't mean
I'll stand by</font>

454
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:07,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">While kyle's intolerance
is dealt with violently.</font>

455
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to war with these
p.C. People once and for all.</font>

456
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, I'm going to need
200 pregnant mexican women</font>

you're p.C. Black and blue!</font>

466
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,309

467
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are language police
fighting bigotry!</font>

468
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurtful words

486
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jared needs backup.
Send in the chinese drivers.</font>

487
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aaah!</font>

488
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, the syrian refugees are
trying to protect their
children.</font>

489

491
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:53,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone stop!</font>

494
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,469

I can't let it continue.</font>

495
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not ever
what I intended.</font>

496
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to say...</font>

497
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caitlyn jenner is a hero.</font>

498
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:16,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no other way to say it.</font>

499
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:20,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">What she did took bravery,
and she is absolutely stunning.</font>

500
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo-hoo!</font>

00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh.</font>

503
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got to hand it to you,
marsh.</font>

504
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really checked
that little boy's privilege.</font>

505
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using those syrian refugees
was genius, bro.</font>

506
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I would've never thought
to use offensive imagery</font>

507
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:06,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">And outrageous
stereotypes</font>

508
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">To provoke someone
to open their eyes.</font>

509
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:08,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'm p.C. Now?</font>

510
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not only p.C.,
you've actually changed my p.C.</font>

511
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congrats.
Here's your oakleys.</font>

513
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, bro.
These are sweet.</font>

514
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I guess p.C. Principal
is here to stay, huh?</font>

515
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

516
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at least
we showed him</font>

517
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:27,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sometimes joking
about un-p.C. Things</font>

518
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can actually
be important</font>

519
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it starts
a dialogue.</font>

520
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:32,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong, kyle?</font>

521
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have your cake.
Eat it, too.</font>

522
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just seems to me
like we all lost in this,</font>

523
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that the only person
who won was you.</font>

524
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm...</font>

525
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who does that
remind you of, kyle?</font>

526
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you don't mind,</font>

527
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go home
and fuck my hot wife.</font>

528
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,172
