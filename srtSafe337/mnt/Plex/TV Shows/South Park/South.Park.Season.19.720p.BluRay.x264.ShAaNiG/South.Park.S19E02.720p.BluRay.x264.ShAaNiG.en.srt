1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, last week
we were all reminded</font>

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">that intolerance still exists
in our country.</font>

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took a very special
young student</font>

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">to light up social media.</font>

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've invited him
to the White House today</font>

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">to show our appreciation.</font>

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because never have there been
more tolerant, more moving words</font>

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">than Kyle Broflovski's speech
about his hero, Caitlyn Jenner.</font>

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,518
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Come on up here, Kyle.</i></font>

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? There!
This is why it's happening.</font>

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's preaching
openness and acceptance,</font>

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so now millions
of Goddamn immigrants</font>

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">are coming over the border,
and nobody seems to care!</font>

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what are you gonna do?</font>

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">In today's world,
it's like you can't even say</font>

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything negative
about illegal immigrants.</font>

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!</font>

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did somebody over here say
"illegal immigrants"?</font>

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the correct term
is "undocumented immigrants,"</font>

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right, bro?</font>

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like nobody cares!</font>

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they just keep coming,</font>

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">crossing the border
with their dirty families,</font>

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">playing their stupid music.</font>

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look at 'em!</font>

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet not one of them
is here legally.</font>

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guy!</font>

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy.</font>

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, what's going on, friend?</font>

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy,
another Moosehead, eh?</font>

31
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have put up
a Goddamn wall.</font>

32
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But wait.
There's still more.</i></font>

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Because this country
was built on dreamers.</i></font>

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Kyle, we want to make
your dreams come true.</font>

35
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so here is your hero,
Caitlyn Jenner.</font>

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to say
thank you, Kyle,</font>

37
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your beautiful words
of support.</font>

38
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Kyle, we got another
little surprise for you.</font>

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We told you we were
flying you back home,</font>

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the truth is,</font>

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're getting a ride back
all the way with your hero.</font>

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you like that?</font>

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckle up, buckaroo.</font>

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, children,
let's take our seats.</font>

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you've probably noticed,
our government has decided</font>

46
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">to let anyone who wants to</font>

47
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">cross the border
and screw up our country.</font>

48
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're all as pissed off
as I am,</font>

49
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">so why don't we begin
today's lesson</font>

50
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">on why the once-great
empire of Rome fell to shit.</font>

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Who can tell me
why Rome fell to shit?</font>

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, somebody who matters.</font>

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, fine.
In the yellow shirt.</font>

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Roman Empire, buddy,
was facing several issues, guy,</font>

55
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">as it reached
a new millennium, friend...</font>

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, speak in English!</font>

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, what happened
is that these immigrants</font>

58
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">called the Goths were welcomed
into Roman territories</font>

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">because some people
felt bad for them.</font>

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then the Goths
suddenly decided</font>

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">they were being oppressed,
you see?</font>

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so, then...</font>

63
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing?</font>

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 8:00 A.M., guy.</font>

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it!</font>

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you Canucks
go back where you came from?</font>

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think you can refer
to an undocumented immigrant</font>

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a "Canuck"?</font>

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C. Principal, they got up
in the middle of my lecture</font>

70
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and started playing music.</font>

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">So did you forget
that at 8:00 and 11:00,</font>

72
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">all Canadians face east
and play Chuck Mangione,</font>

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">or did you not care to find out
about their religious customs?</font>

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">They... They don't
even speak English.</font>

75
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you need to be teaching
in both languages from now on.</font>

76
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mackey, sign the faculty up for
Canadian-language night classes.</font>

77
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

78
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, P.C. Principal!
R-right away! M'kay.</font>

79
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on thin ice, Garrison.</font>

80
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in line,
or you'll be out of a job, bro.</font>

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing now?</font>

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're all eating
together and praying,</font>

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're putting syrup
on their mac and cheese.</font>

84
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! So weird.</font>

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's just so many of them.</font>

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, I think this whole
thing is a conspiracy.</font>

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?
- Think about what happened.</font>

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">America had pretty secure
borders for years.</font>

89
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle gives a big speech
about tolerance and acceptance</font>

90
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">that goes viral.</font>

91
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bunch of Canadians
cross the border illegally.</font>

92
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle's brother is Canadian.</font>

93
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Kyle knowingly
gave that speech</font>

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get all the illegals in?</font>

95
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sitting right here.</font>

96
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's sitting right here.</font>

97
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think just my speech</font>

98
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">brought on a wave
of illegal immigration?</font>

99
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did kind of
go overboard, dude.</font>

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, I know you like
giving speeches and stuff,</font>

102
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not everything
is black and white.</font>

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I mean, it's fine you want
to go preach about Caitlyn Jenner,</font>

104
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't just make
blanket statements</font>

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">about letting anyone do
whatever they want.</font>

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even
want to give that speech!</font>

107
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.
This is interesting.</font>

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you guys read Genesis 34?</font>

109
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unh-unh.
- Well, it's intriguing,</font>

110
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">because in Genesis 34,
the Jews actually did</font>

111
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">something similar
to what Kyle's doing now.</font>

112
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not responsible for this.</font>

113
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Illegal immigration
has been happening forever.</font>

114
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's happening
a lot more now,</font>

115
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">after you decide to give</font>

116
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">a big speech
about Caitlyn Jenner</font>

117
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you want to bring down
the cultural fabric of America</font>

118
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause you're a Jew.</font>

119
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, immigrants,
either legal or illegal,</font>

120
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">are always gonna find ways
to cross into richer countries</font>

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if they're not living...
- Oh, boy.</font>

122
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here we go again.
- Yeah, I'm out.</font>

123
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sorry. I can't listen
to another one either.</font>

124
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy evening, friends.</font>

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we are going
to learn Canadian.</font>

127
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a lot of practice,
you're going to find</font>

128
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">that speaking Canadian
isn't so difficult,</font>

129
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in fact, our alphabet
and yours are fairly similar.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You are fired

And now I'm fired.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's only
one immigration policy</font>

00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I believe in,</font>

198
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's
'em all to death!</font>

199
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying what everyone's
thinking here, kids.</font>

00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Not sorry.</font>

201
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, the Canadians
are pissed off.</font>

202
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you really blame them?</font>

203
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What made Mr. Garrison
do that?</font>

204
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, what if this was all
exactly what Kyle planned?</font>

205
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the Canadians here,
make them feel persecuted,</font>

206
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then what?
Uprisings, rebellion.</font>

207
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next thing you know,</font>

208
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're sending us to camps
and using us as livestock.</font>

209
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think
Kyle would do that?</font>

210
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't matter.</font>

211
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to think of a way
to smooth this over fast.</font>

212
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're gonna need a
symbolic union. A what?</font>

213
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, what's that story
about the two sides</font>

214
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">that were fighting,
and then a guy from one side</font>

215
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">got with a girl
from the other side,</font>

216
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their love sort of
brought the groups together?</font>

217
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Lion King 2"?</font>

218
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, "Lion King 2."</font>

219
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if we can get one of us
to go out with one of them,</font>

220
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">probably have sex,</font>

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">then it could be a symbol
of us all getting along.</font>

222
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's kind of like
when a princess of one country</font>

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">marries the prince of another.</font>

224
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,519

This is stupid.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">don't understand each other,
you can't just try and diffuse</font>

227
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- the tensions with...
- Is he seriously...</font>

228

<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he seriously
giving a speech right now?</font>

230
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna have to happen
pretty fast,</font>

231
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">so whoever's gonna do it needs
to ask a Canadian girl out soon.</font>

we round them all up,</font>

80 years old or something!</font>

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez!
Okay, B-Butters, relax.</font>

297
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:52,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't want
a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!</font>

298
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you just want a race war?</font>

299
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

300
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one in the white shoes
isn't that ugly.</font>

301
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go the one
in the white shoes.</font>

302
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

303
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. My name is Butters.
What's yours?</font>

304
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Charlotte.</font>

305
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Charlotte,
I've never done this before.</font>

306
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think Scar's up there?</font>

307
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't my father,
but he's still part of me.</font>

308
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Simba.
We have barely begun.</font>

309
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll run away together
and... and...</font>

310
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And start a pride
all of our own.</font>

311
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom, the scene at the Canadian
border is electric</font>

312
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">as several political leaders
try and strategize</font>

313
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">how to deal with being shut
out of Canada.</font>

314
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Canadian government
wants to put up a wall,</font>

315
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">they have every right.</font>

316
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:38,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet, we must ask why they
thought this to be necessary.</font>

317
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, them,
and you.</font>

318
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see if they have
really cool back there.</font>

319
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we need is a...</font>

320
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you've got a gaping gash,
and you've got vinegary balls.</font>

321
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Canadians can't do this!</font>

322
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't they realize that hundreds
of thousands of their people</font>

323
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">are over here illegally?</font>

324
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:54,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you guys didn't put up
a wall?</font>

325
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you keep your
Goddamn mouth shut, smart ass!</font>

326
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:58,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll deal with you.</font>

327
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get things done,
and I'm getting back there!</font>

328
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

329
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Butters.</font>

330
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:09,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sore-y I didn't know
what ice cream was.</font>

331
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's sore-y?</font>

332
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's what Canadians say
to express remorse.</font>

333
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
H-Hey, that's neato.</font>

334
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:16,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

335
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on, Charlotte, one sec.</font>

336
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

337
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you given her
the old Hot Cosby yet?</font>

338
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:25,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We saw a movie,
and now we're going to the park.</font>

339
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters,
we don't have time for that.</font>

340
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:29,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, you have to cut
to the chase with a Hot Cosby.</font>

341
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm gonna be with this girl,
I don't want her</font>

342
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">someday thinking
it was all super rushed.</font>

343
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares
about 40 years from now</font>

344
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">when she suddenly changes
her mind, Butters.</font>

345
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time is of the essence!
We're all gonna die!</font>

346
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:40,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything all right?</font>

347
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:42,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, just some
work-related stuff.</font>

348
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, hey, I wanted to see</font>

349
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you wanted come over
to my house for dinner tomorrow.</font>

350
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy.
Yes, I'd love to.</font>

351
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:53,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.
Oh, God.</font>

352
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:59,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's... that's good.</font>

353
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch the balls.</font>

354
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right,
give me the helmet.</font>

355
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll see what they've got
behind that Goddamn wall.</font>

356
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I am, friends?</font>

357
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a doer.</font>

358
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
Yeah! That's right!</font>

359
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canada says we can't go
into their country,</font>

360
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going into their country!</font>

361
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when I do,</font>

362
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am every last
Canadian so hard!</font>

363
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's do this.</font>

364
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, he's dead.</font>

365
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, young man, I understand</font>

366
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:53,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you and my daughter
have started a romance.</font>

367
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh...
Well, yes, sir.</font>

368
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I suppose you have a thing
for Canadian girls, huh?</font>

369
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that it?
You've got maple fever?</font>

370
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, Daddy!</font>

371
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Charlotte,
but I get suspicious.</font>

372
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:04,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad enough we have
to live in America.</font>

373
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now all the boys
with maple fever</font>

374
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:07,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">are gonna want to have
at our daughter.</font>

375
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough, Donald.
Wait.</font>

376
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to be here?</font>

377
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would we want to be here?</font>

378
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:12,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know,</font>

379
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause everything is great here,
and we have cool stuff.</font>

380
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canada has everything.</font>

381
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the greatest country
on Earth.</font>

382
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... so,
then why did you leave?</font>

383
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:27,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were several candidates
during the Canadian elections.</font>

384
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them was this brash
asshole who just spoke his mind.</font>

385
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:33,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't really offer
any solutions.</font>

386
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just said outrageous things.</font>

387
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought it was funny.</font>

388
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody really thought
he'd ever be president.</font>

389
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:40,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a joke.</font>

390
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we just let the joke go on
for too long.</font>

391
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kept gaining momentum,</font>

392
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and by the time
we were all ready to say,</font>

393
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Okay, let's get serious now.</font>

394
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:48,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who should really be president?"</font>

395
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was already being sworn
into office.</font>

396
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't paying attention.</font>

397
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't paying attention!</font>

398
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:01,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez.
How bad can a president be?</font>

399
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">If certain people want to leave
this country, then let them!</font>

400
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell those pussy homos
they can suck my balls!</font>

401
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Mr. President...</font>

402
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell
the prime minister of China</font>

403
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he can suck my balls!</font>

404
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and Johnson...
Mr. President?</font>

405
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suck my balls.</font>

406
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sore-y
about my papa.</font>

407
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can be really emotional
sometimes.</font>

408
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't got
to be sore-y.</font>

409
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me
who should be sore-y.</font>

410
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think everyone has
the wrong idea</font>

411
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">about your people, Charlotte.</font>

412
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

413
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just have to give them time.</font>

414
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't supposed to have time.</font>

415
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed to give you
a Hot Cosby</font>

416
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">so our species could coexist.</font>

417
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I realize you guys
don't even want to be here.</font>

418
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

419
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you want to be here?</font>

420
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now?</font>

421
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's really nowhere
I'd rather be.</font>

422
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's okay with you...</font>

423
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to try
a nice Slow Cosby instead.</font>

424
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Canada,
we call a Slow Cosby "love."</font>

425
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look!</font>

426
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">A shooting star.</font>

427
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Canada,
we say that's good luck.</font>

428
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do we.</font>

429
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:40,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

430
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!
Oh, God!</font>

431
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

432
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:58,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everyone, guy?</font>

433
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:05,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez.</font>

434
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Safety dance</font>

435
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ We can dance if we want to</font>

436
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:32,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

437
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ We can leave...</font>

438
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

439
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did a U.S. citizen
get past my wall?</font>

440
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came here to find out
where my country gone.</font>

441
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where <i>your</i> country gone?
Where <i>my</i> country gone!</font>

442
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, where <i>my</i> country gone,
bitch!</font>

443
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody talks to me

00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody talks to me

00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ergh! Yeah?

447
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:51,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can...</font>

448
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go!
There you go!</font>

449
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came here to do one thing!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

455
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

456
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at them, Thomas.</font>

457
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
they really like each other.</font>

458
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I have to admit,</font>

459
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">it seems they're actually
falling in Slow Cosby.</font>

460
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it.</font>

461
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey did you hear the news,
buddy?</font>

462
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canadian President

463
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Yes!</font>

464
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Are you sure?</font>

465
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Donald?</font>

466
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:34,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canadian President

467
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my goodness!</font>

468
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we go back
to Canada, then?</font>

469
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I guess, let's go back.</font>

470
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See ya!

00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll Skype you when I'm home,
my love!</font>

475
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I should've done
the Hot Cosby.</font>

476
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it, Garrison!</font>

477
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Garrison!</font>

478
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends, I think I've proven</font>

479
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">that my policies work
to get things done.</font>

480
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what my true calling is,</font>

481
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am going to keep this
going all the way to Washington.</font>

482
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on! Wait!
It wasn't me!</font>

483
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't the one
who brought the Canadians here.</font>

484
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was something just like this.</font>

485
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see?</font>

486
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's anything
we've learned,</font>

487
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's that we have to stop</font>

488
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">this kind
of sensationalistic politics</font>

489
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the same thing
happens to us,</font>

490
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if we let this
kind of...</font>

491
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:37,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">this...</font>

492
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">kind of...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude.</font>

494
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbelievable.</font>

495
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, my friends,
I have to say goodbye now</font>

496
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm off to Washington
with my running mate.</font>

497
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckle up, buckaroo!</font>

498
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm off to Washington
with my running mate!</font>
