00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try out that one there.</font>

15
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Two of us, please.</font>

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sorry, guys. We got
about a 30-minute wait.</font>

17
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, excuse me.</font>

18
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:09,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. Give me a second.
I'll have a table right away.</font>

19
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. What'd you say to him?</font>

20
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:14,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just told him who I am.</font>

21
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:15,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

22
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a Yelp reviewer.</font>

23
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I usually keep it on the down-low
so they don't kiss my ass too much.</font>

24
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:21,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right over here, sir.</font>

25
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys, welcome to Vernacular.</font>

26
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

27
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, did they mention to
you that I am a Yelper?</font>

28
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we've been alerted, sir.</font>

29
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:31,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

30
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you have them turn the
lights up a little, please?</font>

31
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:37,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at it, Gerald... All
the new families moving in.</font>

32
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:40,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our little town is all grown up.</font>

33
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's that other taco
plate? We need it now!</font>

34
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little overwhelmed.</font>

35
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:50,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but we put everything into
moving here and starting this business,</font>

36
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:51,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we have to be impressive.</font>

37
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:54,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">David, you must help
your mama however you can.</font>

38
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going back
to that miserable place.</font>

39
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to go back, either.</font>

40
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, done.
- Great!</font>

41
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:02,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really have to impress this
customer. He's a local food critic.</font>

42
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another one?</font>

43
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm.</font>

44
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, here you go, amigo...</font>

45
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another taco plate and the taquitos.</font>

46
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you.</font>

47
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:15,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did I mention I am
a food critic for Yelp?</font>

48
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:17,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you mentioned that several times.</font>

49
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I just didn't want
you caught off guard.</font>

50
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking of giving
this place five stars.</font>

51
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

52
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:26,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering
on five stars or one star.</font>

53
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no. No one star,
please. What can we do to...</font>

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I could probably be
persuaded with some free desserts.</font>

55
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:32,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get that for you.</font>

56
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. And could you
turn down the music a bit?</font>

57
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This pagan shit hurts my ears.
- Of course.</font>

58
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey. Hey, busboy.</font>

59
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Busboy! Busboy! Por favor!</font>

60
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:44,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Busboy!
- My name is David.</font>

61
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:47,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- I said my name is David.</font>

62
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:50,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, it's actually
pronounced "Day-vid," okay?</font>

63
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm "Da-veed."</font>

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's David, dude. Look it up.</font>

65
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:55,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

66
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not argue, son. We need him.</font>

67
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are... A few free desserts.</font>

68
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, excuse me. More customers.</font>

69
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi. Two of us for lunch, please.
- Yes. Right away.</font>

70
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, uh, I just wanted to mention
that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers,</font>

71
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">so, uh, your best table, please.</font>

72
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:11,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez. You guys, too, huh?</font>

73
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:13,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, um, I'll get you set
up right over here, okay?</font>

74
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

75
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. This place seems nice.</font>

76
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we'll see.</font>

77
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we'll see, won't we?</font>

78
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Now everyone
thinks they're a food critic.</font>

79
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get them? Did you get
them? Did you get them? Huh?</font>

80
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

81
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

82
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.</font>

83
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:37,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you do it, Eric?</font>

84
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a restaurant critic,
Butters. I get whatever I want.</font>

85
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez.</font>

86
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the cafeteria's back that way,</font>

87
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">and most of the classrooms
are this way down the...</font>

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew! What's the busboy doing here?</font>

89
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:49,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- David is new to our school.
- Oh, cool.</font>

90
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna clean
the tables here, too?</font>

91
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you get to school? Do you
ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?</font>

92
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

93
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, amigo, I'm sorry I only gave
your parents' restaurant two stars,</font>

94
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but it could've been worse.
- Why'd you only give them two stars?</font>

95
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but the food
totally messed my stomach up.</font>

96
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">The morning after I ate
it, I went to the bathroom,</font>

97
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my poop was all solid...
Like, no water at all.</font>

98
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:06,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not supposed to have water, you...</font>

99
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like this one, solid piece
that I had to push out my asshole.</font>

100
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like being raped from the inside.</font>

101
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents' restaurant just
wasn't up to my standards, "Day-vid."</font>

102
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Da-veed."
- "Day-vid."</font>

103
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:17,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Da-veed."
- "Day-vid."</font>

104
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:18,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Da-veed."</font>

105
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:19,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Day-vid."Day-vid."
"Day-vid."Day-vid."</font>

106
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can update this to a one-star
review in two seconds, dude.</font>

107
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I love being
a restaurant critic.</font>

108
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet, there was more.</font>

109
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:37,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">For in this crisp time
when autumn begins to fade,</font>

110
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">the chef brines chicken in habañero</font>

111
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even adds habañero
powder to the crust.</font>

112
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the heat is restrained.</font>

113
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:49,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You experience the fruity, delicious
flavor of this without any spicy pain.</font>

114
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need anymore pain.</font>

115
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, does anyone?</font>

116
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald, we're going to the park.</font>

117
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to come along?</font>

118
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:01,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, honey. This review for
Applebee's has turned into a 50-pager.</font>

119
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.</font>

120
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you take a
break from Yelping, Gerald?</font>

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem a little overwhelmed.</font>

122
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am overwhelmed.</font>

123
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, I don't know
what I've gotten myself into.</font>

124
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now everyone relies
on my Yelp reviews,</font>

125
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I-I don't want to let anyone down.</font>

126
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:19,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's chicken in
the fridge if you get hungry.</font>

127
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, but I-I got Yelp a new
place in Shi Tpa Town tonight.</font>

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I'm so damn tired.</font>

129
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, have fun.</font>

130
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha. "Fun," she says.</font>

131
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:34,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">In finality, I would say my
experience at Applebee's was sublime</font>

132
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:37,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my treatment near that
of a gladiator most decorated.</font>

133
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:38,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the street parking
wasn't that great.</font>

134
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two-and-a-half
stars.</font>

135
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

136
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Liza. I'll
introduce you to the girls.</font>

137
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, aren't you eating lunch, Eric?</font>

138
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a food critic, Butters, okay?</font>

139
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't just eat cafeteria food.</font>

140
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, here you are, sir!</font>

141
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's orange peel chicken,</font>

142
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">some city beef, and a city egg roll!</font>

143
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you joking?</font>

144
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you are a little late.</font>

145
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, I don't know,
maybe only-one-star late.</font>

146
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:07,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. No one star, please.</font>

147
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You Yelpers are killing me.</font>

148
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you no pay. You no pay. Please.</font>

149
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds good. Now get
the fuck out of here.</font>

150
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes!</font>

151
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the fuck out! Thank you!</font>

152
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. Well, you're
pretty important, Eric.</font>

153
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:20,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not important at all.</font>

154
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:21,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no.</font>

155
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, you're right,
Kyle. I'm not important.</font>

156
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, David, I was just wondering.</font>

157
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, how do you get to school?</font>

158
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:30,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?</font>

159
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:31,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it.
- What?</font>

160
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to hear him say,</font>

161
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Si, me ride me tiny
bicicleta to school."</font>

162
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Si, me ride me tiny bicicleta to school.</font>

163
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome.</font>

164
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:42,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go out to recess.</font>

165
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you bus this for me, David? Thanks.</font>

166
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, don't. Dude... Dude, don't.</font>

167
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:52,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, it's midnight.</font>

168
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go home. Get some sleep.</font>

169
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time to sleep when
the city's counting on me.</font>

170
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">More Yelp reviews, sir?</font>

171
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a bad experience at Red Lobster,</font>

172
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if the people don't know
about it, they could, too.</font>

173
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folks deserve to know
where to eat, Mitch.</font>

174
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">But does anyone even thank you for it?</font>

175
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need them to.</font>

176
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they need me, and that's enough.</font>

177
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">God bless you, sir.</font>

178
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

179
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's.</font>

180
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:24,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all enjoying your pizza?</font>

181
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look here, my good man. We've
been waiting over 15 minutes</font>

182
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you to sing "Happy
Birthday" to our son.</font>

183
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:30,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately for you,</font>

184
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are both restaurant
critics, and so is our son.</font>

185
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">One star.</font>

186
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:38,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me! Emergency!
Over here! Emergency!</font>

187
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:41,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like a table inside the area
with all the little plastic balls, please.</font>

188
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make it snappy. I am
a food critic for Yelp.</font>

189
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That does it! I've had enough!</font>

190
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you Yelp reviewers
get the hell out of here!</font>

191
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what
happens to my business!</font>

192
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't kissing your asses no more!</font>

193
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:57,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every Yelper, get the fuck out of here!</font>

195
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:03,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful now, Bill. You
don't want a one-star review.</font>

196
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a food critic, Dennis!</font>

197
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fucking mechanic!</font>

198
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now get the fuck out! Go on!</font>

199
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:13,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you Yelping sons of bitches
get the fuck out of here!</font>

200
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna regret
this, Whistlin' Willy.</font>

201
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't treat Yelpers this way.</font>

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the... Get the fuck out!</font>

203
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

204
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good for you.</font>

205
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too, you son of a bitch.</font>

206
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Hey!</font>

207
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over! It's over!</font>

208
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see paper? It's over!</font>

209
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whistlin' Willy! He
stand up to the Yelpers!</font>

210
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have to kiss
their asses anymore!</font>

211
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look! Everybody doing the same!</font>

212
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over! It's over!</font>

213
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Skeeter, you hear the news?</font>

214
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:52,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a miracle.</font>

215
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a miracle!</font>

216
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck.</font>

217
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:01,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, dude, somebody
spilled shit on the floor.</font>

218
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, David, somebody
spilled something here.</font>

219
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you clean this up, por favor?</font>

220
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:06,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">David?</font>

221
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here. There's
some shit on the floor.</font>

222
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on, man?</font>

223
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't heard?</font>

224
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody gives a fuck what
Yelp reviewers think anymore.</font>

225
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

226
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:17,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the most influential
critic in this town.</font>

227
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, David, forget the
spill. Just give me one little,</font>

228
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My name is David. Me ride
me bicicleta to school."</font>

229
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is "Da-veed."</font>

230
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

231
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm... I'm updating my review.</font>

232
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm about to do it.</font>

233
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:35,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better say, "I ride
me bicicleta to school!"</font>

234
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">One star.</font>

235
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">No... no stars?</font>

236
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stars?</font>

237
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:46,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just treat
me like I'm nothing.</font>

238
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still know I'm worth something.</font>

239
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys.</font>

240
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:55,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Y-you guys stay at school.</font>

241
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:58,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cool. Y-you guys stay here.</font>

242
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Eric.</font>

243
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:37,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all over, Butters.</font>

244
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:40,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything I've worked
so hard to achieve.</font>

245
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these hack wannabe food critics
have made my profession a joke.</font>

246
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:44,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, I'm sorry, bud.</font>

247
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these people trying to be like me,</font>

248
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they don't even write about
poop consistency the next day.</font>

249
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:52,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Eric, you should be proud
that people want to be like you.</font>

250
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you really started something.</font>

251
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess.</font>

252
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:56,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well if these people look up to you,</font>

253
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe... maybe you can sort
of set the record straight</font>

254
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and show them the way
it's supposed to be done.</font>

255
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, Butters.</font>

256
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I can actually use
all these people somehow</font>

257
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make real food
critics respected again.</font>

258
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?</font>

259
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up.</font>

260
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">If people are gonna be trying
all the new restaurants in town,</font>

261
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll have to do
it without my reviews.</font>

262
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:24,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

263
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:27,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said that protecting people
from bad dining experiences</font>

264
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">was what kept you going.</font>

265
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">The restaurants put up
signs saying I can't come in.</font>

266
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why they singled me out,</font>

267
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:37,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's like people don't need me.</font>

268
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll be damned.</font>

269
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:40,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

270
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's put a note in the mailbox
asking me to come and talk to them.</font>

271
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do need me.</font>

272
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:50,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get going.</font>

273
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:51,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to come along?</font>

274
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:53,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. They're just asking for me.</font>

275
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess maybe I do
have a town to protect.</font>

276
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you having a party, sweetheart?</font>

277
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:05,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a party, mom.</font>

278
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've invited all the poser
food critics over for a meeting.</font>

279
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:08,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, how fun.</font>

280
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not fun. It's serious.</font>

281
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people think
they can do what I do,</font>

282
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they need to be made
to understand the reality.</font>

283
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the Yelpers get here,
I need you to get lost, okay?</font>

284
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's them, that's
them. Go! Get lost, mom!</font>

285
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:21,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello! Hi!</font>

286
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is...</font>

287
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here for the meeting.</font>

288
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this the right place?</font>

289
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

290
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom!</font>

291
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going, honey.</font>

292
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, there's like a billion people here!</font>

293
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, sweetie. I think quite
a few people are Yelp reviewers.</font>

294
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:39,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this many people have nothing
better to do than write reviews on Yelp?</font>

295
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess so, honey. Do
you need more lemonade?</font>

296
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, there's a fucking
billion people here.</font>

297
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, thank you all for coming.</font>

298
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Eric, and as you know,</font>

299
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">us Yelpers are being scrutinized.</font>

300
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:55,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you speak a little louder?</font>

301
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:58,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, us Yelp critics
are being scrutinized!</font>

302
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right! Yeah!</font>

303
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you see the problem is that
when there's too many reviewers,</font>

304
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:06,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">people no longer know who
is the real food critic.</font>

305
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:09,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's great that you
all want to be critics,</font>

306
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we all know who the real
food analyst of the town is.</font>

307
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:14,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right!</font>

308
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:15,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

309
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha. Oh, thanks.</font>

310
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:21,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, as long as
there is one clear leader,</font>

311
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">then the rest of you can just follow.</font>

312
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with this many people
all following one captain,</font>

313
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can fight to get our power back!</font>

314
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poweeeer back!</font>

315
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now rise up, and
fight for your leader!</font>

316
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:37,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight together, and show the restaurants
that our food critic does matter!</font>

317
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:40,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let's go!</font>

318
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, follow me!</font>

319
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:45,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, everyone!</font>

320
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another local business is
closing its doors tonight</font>

321
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">after being taken
down by Yelp reviewers.</font>

322
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whistlin' Willy's, a
child favorite in town,</font>

323
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">was destroyed and its
owner stripped and beheaded.</font>

324
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">The following video is graphic.</font>

325
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please! No, no, no, no, no!</font>

326
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww!</font>

327
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all loved Whistlin' Willy's.</font>

328
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't do well with Yelpers.</font>

329
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:48,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You assholes destroyed
the best place in town</font>

330
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they wouldn't kiss your asses!</font>

331
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, admit it. The food sucked.</font>

332
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:53,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody went for the fucking food!</font>

333
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:54,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry guys,</font>

334
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Whistlin' Willy failed
to recognize the influence</font>

335
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:59,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone like me has on their business.</font>

336
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I just have one
question for you, David.</font>

337
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ride</font>

338
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:11,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">your teeny, tiny bicicleta to school?</font>

339
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sí. Me ride mi teeny
bicicleta to school.</font>

340
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're done.</font>

341
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm done!</font>

342
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm now the leader of
thousands of people!</font>

343
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all hang on my every word,</font>

344
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:29,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna use my power to finally
get what this town really needs.</font>

345
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:36,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found the waitstaff
at Red Lobster to be rude</font>

346
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:38,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">and barely even acknowledging who I was</font>

347
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:40,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">or what I meant to this city.</font>

348
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown
school. You care to join us?</font>

349
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, honey.</font>

350
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm now the leader of
thousands of people.</font>

351
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all hang on my every word.</font>

352
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm going to use my power</font>

353
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">to finally get what
this town really needs.</font>

354
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the fifth day in a row,</font>

355
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:14,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">historic Shi Tpa Town is
under siege by Yelp reviewers.</font>

356
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:17,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">The restaurants are still
refusing to be intimidated,</font>

357
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:18,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Yelp reviewers are...</font>

358
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Yelp reviewers are
preparing for all-out war.</font>

359
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:26,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">The angry Yelp reviewers are
demanding special treatment</font>

360
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">at all city restaurants.</font>

361
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">They claim that as local food critics,</font>

362
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:33,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">they deserve respect and that
all who oppose them will suffer.</font>

363
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The online restaurant
critics are getting ready</font>

364
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:36,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">to bring businesses to their knees,</font>

365
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some are already
closing their doors.</font>

366
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">One local restaurant
worker actually called out</font>

367
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:43,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Yelp critics' leader!</font>

368
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you win, huh, big shot?</font>

369
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really are any
kind of important anybody,</font>

370
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">then get your bullshit food-critic ass</font>

371
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the south of town and face me,</font>

372
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:54,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you aren't a food
critic, and you aren't important!</font>

373
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:58,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">And unless you're chicken,
I'll see you south of town.</font>

374
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where you going, sir?
- You heard him.</font>

375
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little Mexican kid called me out.</font>

376
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to fight me, that's fine.</font>

377
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need backup, sir?</font>

378
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He's just calling me out.</font>

379
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">God bless you, sir...</font>

380
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know!</font>

381
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:17,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">David! Dude, wait!</font>

382
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you don't wanna do this.</font>

383
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what
Cartman's capable of.</font>

384
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I come from, we
settle things with our fists.</font>

385
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this isn't Mexico.</font>

386
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not from Mexico, dude!</font>

387
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm from Idaho!</font>

388
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna show this prick
how we do things in Boise.</font>

389
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello, David!</font>

390
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you've got your army.</font>

391
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got your followers.</font>

392
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:40,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're such a great leader,</font>

393
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:42,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">then just tell the city
what you want, fat ass!</font>

394
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me fat, son.</font>

395
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:46,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing this because they've...</font>

396
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:50,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I want is to be able to lead these fine
people with the respect and the dignity...</font>

397
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask to be the
leader. I was appointed!</font>

398
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:56,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, I'm extremely important to
this town, and I'm not going to be...</font>

399
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:58,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">My journey as this town's food...</font>

400
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've made these people feel unwanted,
and now they look to me for answers.</font>

401
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid,</font>

402
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:11,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet willing to do
what the people of this...</font>

403
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:13,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so we said to hell with it!</font>

404
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we took the challenge to
go from the town's food critics</font>

405
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the town's spiritual leaders.</font>

406
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we want?</font>

407
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:22,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">People would say, "Oh,
you're just a food blogger.</font>

408
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just a tiny voice in the crowd."</font>

409
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:28,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now my voice is
heard, and I will...</font>

410
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:31,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanted special privileges,</font>

411
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">but these people think
I should have them.</font>

412
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, guys?</font>

413
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I don't deserve special treatment,</font>

414
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:39,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">but how else can I be the
elite food critic they want?</font>

415
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every person here thinks
this is about them.</font>

416
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:47,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I know what to do.</font>

417
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:50,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Me, too.</font>

418
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,352

424
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a big responsibility,

425
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,829

439
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes. The steak, please.</font>

440
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,155

441
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we got a Yelper.
Give it that special attention.</font>
