00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, we're gonna be
showing you some art</font>

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">from our Asian-American
students, and...</font>

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, Leslie!
Shut your fucking pie hole!</font>

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">From our Asian-American students</font>

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">presented by
student-body president</font>

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wendy Testaberger.</font>

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know,
we have several new students</font>

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">here at South Park Elementary.</font>

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have been getting to know
some of the Asian girls,</font>

21
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">who have introduced us
to an art style called yaoi.</font>

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yaoi is a blend
of emotion and beauty</font>

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">involving two people
whose love is looked down upon.</font>

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">The art tries to show
that all love is magical,</font>

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">like in Lisa Akimoto's piece,</font>

26
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tweek and Craig:
Forbidden Love."</font>

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

28
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kelly Zhou goes
a bit more whimsical</font>

29
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">with "Craig and Tweek:
Moonlight Dance."</font>

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what the fuck?</font>

31
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">In yaoi art, the seme, or "top,"</font>

32
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">is usually dominating
the uke, or "bottom,"</font>

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">as demonstrated
in Heather Nishimura's</font>

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tweek and Craig: Boizu Rabu."</font>

35
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">But yaoi can branch out
to other things, as well...</font>

36
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

37
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">As we see here in
"Lily, Frog, Tweek, and Craig."</font>

38
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't get it.</font>

39
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, Tweek and Craig
aren't gay, right?</font>

40
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We would know.</font>

41
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, but then why would
Asian girls draw them like that?</font>

42
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what is
this yaoi thing all about?</font>

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so c-confused.</font>

44
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it can happen
to Tweek and Craig,</font>

45
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">could it happen to any of us?</font>

46
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me.
Why are you doing this?</font>

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi, Craig.</font>

48
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What did she say?</font>

49
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. That was Korean.
I'm Japanese.</font>

50
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on, huh?</font>

51
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and him aren't together!
Why is this happening?</font>

52
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone thinks I'm gay!</font>

53
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if my parents find out?
Aah!</font>

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.C. All right, guys,
I know there's been</font>

55
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lot of rumors flying around.</font>

56
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wanted to check in, see if
you have any questions for me.</font>

57
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are the Asian girls drawing
pictures of us being gay?</font>

58
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with being gay?
Nothing wrong with that.</font>

59
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we aren't. I'm not.</font>

60
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not either!</font>

61
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is completely
irrelevant, okay?</font>

62
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">What matters, and the reason
I brought you in here,</font>

63
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that you understand
affirmative consent.</font>

64
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

65
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there is
a romantic relationship here,</font>

66
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to make sure
your partner is comfortable</font>

67
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">with any sexual exploration.</font>

68
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

69
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, in a gay relationship,
it gets a little trickier,</font>

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you still have to follow
some guidelines, all right?</font>

71
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not gay!</font>

72
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about that, bro!</font>

73
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, if...
And I'm only saying if...</font>

74
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">At some point you wanted
to touch Craig's penis,</font>

75
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't just go grabbing
for it, all right?</font>

76
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would need to say
something like,</font>

77
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Craig, is it all right with you
if I touch your penis?"</font>

78
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Let's try it out.</font>

79
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

80
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want two weeks detention
instead?</font>

81
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">This shit's important!</font>

82
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig, can I touch your penis?</font>

83
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Good.</font>

84
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Craig, you might say,</font>

85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You may touch my penis.
I'm comfortable with that."</font>

86
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, of course, you could say,</font>

87
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">"No, you may not touch my penis
at this time."</font>

88
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you may not.</font>

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.</font>

90
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Craig, what would you say</font>

91
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you wanted to take a gander
at Tweek's asshole?</font>

92
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, you should have
a talk with Stan.</font>

93
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

94
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess something happened
at school today</font>

95
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">involving two of Stan's friends
being gay.</font>

96
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

97
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Stan seems
really perplexed.</font>

98
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

99
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our town has only had
a Whole Foods for three weeks,</font>

100
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we already have
our first gay kids.</font>

101
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">So cool.</font>

102
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go talk to him, Randy,
and be delicate.</font>

103
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, bud.</font>

104
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it hanging?</font>

105
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm confused, Dad.
There was this thing at school.</font>

106
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what.</font>

107
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a really
progressive P.C. dad</font>

108
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">who knows all about
this stuff, okay?</font>

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead. Ask me anything.</font>

110
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't understand
how it's decided.</font>

111
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, well, you see,
it's a combination</font>

112
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">of genetic, hormonal,
and environmental influences.</font>

113
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean, like,
what makes the Asians decide</font>

114
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">who they're gonna make gay?</font>

115
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Asians?</font>

116
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Asians decide
who's gonna be gay?</font>

117
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, they do.</font>

118
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, the Asians just, you know...</font>

119
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just pick who they pick,</font>

120
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, um, so it's
the way it's always been.</font>

121
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you've heard of yaoi?</font>

122
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course.</font>

123
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yaoi, anal intercourse,
Maui Zaui.</font>

124
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I know all this stuff, Stan.</font>

125
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Thomas!</font>

126
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we heard about Craig.</font>

127
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think it's just terrific.</font>

128
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Craig?</font>

129
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

130
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad
that Craig is finally happy.</font>

131
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it's Craig's dad,
everybody!</font>

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek's out of coffee, honey.</font>

133
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, here you go, kiddo.</font>

134
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, is there anything
you want to talk to us about?</font>

135
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

136
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we heard that you're gay.</font>

137
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want you to know we've
never been so proud of you.</font>

138
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

139
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought you were just a spaz,</font>

140
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to know you've got
so much going on inside...</font>

141
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're so proud of you, Tweek.</font>

142
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowing what I know now,</font>

143
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be
a much better dad to you.</font>

144
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I just...</font>

145
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to give you
some money, Tweek.</font>

146
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I give you some money?</font>

147
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. I-I love you so much, son.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanting to, like, kiss a dude?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess just because
I don't understand it</font>

177
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't mean
I shouldn't support it.</font>

178
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

179
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you can help them along.</font>

180
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Can I?</font>

181
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Cupid Me.</font>

182
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">But make it quick,
and don't let anyone see you.</font>

183
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you! I will!</font>

184
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee! Tee hee hee hee!</font>

185
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee!</font>

186
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,957

187
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just need
a little spark of magic.</font>

188
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee!</font>

189
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm gonna pee
in your mouth.</font>

190
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, love is in the air!</font>

191
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you do it, Cupid Me?</font>

192
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hit him with my love arrow,</font>

193
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I peed in his mouth
just for fun.</font>

194
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome!</font>

195
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's so sweet!</font>

196
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might like that.</font>

197
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.</font>

198
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you think I'm cute, too?</font>

199
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I think
you're kind of cute.</font>

200
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that, Cupid Me.</font>

201
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I'm not homosexual.
Okay? It's not funny.</font>

202
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well. At least Tweek
and Craig are in love now.</font>

203
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. School tomorrow
should be really interesting.</font>

204
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so then my dad
talked to me about it.</font>

205
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:51,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

206
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my dad says Asians
have always done this,</font>

207
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they, like,
do make people gay.</font>

208
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys! You guys! Hurry!
- What?</font>

209
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... It's
Tweek and Craig, dude!</font>

210
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're about to have sex!</font>

211
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a fucking problem, man?</font>

212
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one
with the fucking problem!</font>

213
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to stay
100 yards from me!</font>

214
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better not
fucking push me again, man!</font>

215
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, you guys. Get a room.</font>

216
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Mr. Tucker?</font>

217
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to inform you
that your son</font>

218
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">was in an altercation
at school today.</font>

219
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig? Craig got in a fight?</font>

220
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, with his boyfriend.</font>

221
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a lovers' quarrel,
probably.</font>

222
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it.</font>

223
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something to be expected
in relationships.</font>

224
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, there were
no affirmative-consent issues,</font>

225
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">as your son knows the right way</font>

226
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">to play with
another boy's penis.</font>

227
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

228
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not gonna be
any disciplinary action.</font>

229
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since they are gay,
we want to be supportive.</font>

230
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're just gonna
send them on home</font>

231
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">with some money, all right?</font>

232
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you have a nice day.</font>

233
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Money?</font>

234
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hi. Mr. Jinping?</font>

235
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for taking my call.</font>

236
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just wondering
if you could shed some light</font>

237
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">on how your people
decide who will be gay</font>

238
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">and who will be straight.</font>

239
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

240
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I-I don't speak
Asian, but, um...</font>

241
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh... Oh!</font>

242
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-Yaoi. Yaoi, yes?</font>

243
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boyzu love-u.</font>

244
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">H-How does that work?</font>

245
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">That come from Japan.</font>

246
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's Japan that decides?</font>

247
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the hell do they actually
make people ga...</font>

248
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Japan, of course,</font>

249
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">is who does the yaoi
to make people gay.</font>

250
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are dogs
who refuse not apologize</font>

251
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the Chinese Republic!</font>

252
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh. Yes.</font>

253
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, of course, I do already
know about homosexuality.</font>

254
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Flower delivery
for Eric Cartman.</font>

255
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my. How beautiful!</font>

256
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, sweetie!
Someone sent you flowers.</font>

257
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Can't we just try? TeeHee."</font>

258
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

259
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are they from, hon?</font>

260
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who needs
a real talking to.</font>

261
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's flattering, okay?</font>

262
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't change the fact</font>

263
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">that there's nothing here
for you to keep pursuing.</font>

264
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee! Aw, come on.
Let's be like Tweek and Craig.</font>

265
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone thinks they're cool.</font>

266
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are wasting your time.
I'm not attracted to guys.</font>

267
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm so attracted to you.</font>

268
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize that, and I'm sorry.</font>

269
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to stop bothering me.</font>

270
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is done.</font>

271
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just not a homosexual.</font>

272
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello, Craig.</font>

273
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, it's Craig.</font>

274
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww, hi, Craig.</font>

275
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Tweek home?</font>

276
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sure is. Come on in.</font>

277
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to have
some coffee, Craig?</font>

278
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.
I just want to see Tweek.</font>

279
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww.</font>

280
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek's just
up in his room playing.</font>

281
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go on up.</font>

282
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, but keep the door open,
all right?</font>

283
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're so gay.</font>

284
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aargh! Aah! Unh!</font>

285
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

286
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dude.</font>

287
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:13,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

288
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! What are you doing here?</font>

289
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, calm down.
We have to put a stop to this.</font>

290
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no stopping it!</font>

291
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world wants me
to be something I'm not!</font>

292
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too, dude. But there's
something we can do.</font>

293
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

294
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to come out
and say we're gay.</font>

295
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Are you insane?</font>

296
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's got to be one of...
- Tweek, Tweek!</font>

297
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if we're gay,
then we can break up.</font>

298
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we break up,
no more pictures.</font>

299
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just have to stage
a fake breakup</font>

300
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">in front of the Asian girls.</font>

301
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like acting? No, man.
That is way too much pressure.</font>

302
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do it, Tweek.</font>

303
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're capable of more
than you think.</font>

304
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! I'm a terrible actor.</font>

305
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:51,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just follow my lead and try
and make it believable, okay?</font>

306
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Okay. Oh, God!</font>

307
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I do wrong, huh?</font>

308
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's so damn happy,</font>

309
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">but... but why did this
have to happen to my son?</font>

310
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I do to
make my son like this?</font>

311
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, whoa.
You didn't do anything.</font>

312
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what? You know about this?</font>

313
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, let me handle this, guys.
I'm P.C.</font>

314
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Thomas, you need
to understand that being gay</font>

315
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't a decision.</font>

316
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, a lot of people
think that Asians decide</font>

317
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's gay and who's not.</font>

318
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it isn't all Asians.</font>

319
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just specifically
the Japanese, okay?</font>

320
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

321
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do the Japanese make
some people gay and others not?</font>

322
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it goes back
to World War ll</font>

323
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">and atrocities
that happened in China</font>

324
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">called the Rape of Don King.</font>

325
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you sure know
a lot about this.</font>

326
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

327
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, dude. I looked it up.</font>

328
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yaoi is just an art style
for girls by girls</font>

329
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they like fictionalizing
two guys in a relationship.</font>

330
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But why?
- I don't know.</font>

331
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the point is,</font>

332
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing about it
that means Tweek and Craig</font>

333
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">are actually gay at all.</font>

334
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Tweek. Hold up.</font>

335
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, it's just not
going to work.</font>

336
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why not?</font>

337
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Tweek, but we can't
lie to ourselves anymore.</font>

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are gay.
But we do not belong together.</font>

339
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't belong together?
What suddenly changed, Craig?</font>

340
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that people
are different. That's all.</font>

341
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.
And who the hell is Michael?</font>

342
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? You want to tell me that?</font>

343
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what are you...
What are you talking about?</font>

344
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went through your phone when
we went out last night, Craig.</font>

345
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your text to Michael
about hooking up with him!</font>

346
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, uh...
T-That's not what happened.</font>

347
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's not?</font>

348
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. L-Look, we both know
this is for the better.</font>

349
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't use that
lame shit on me, man.</font>

350
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to feel bad,</font>

351
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you try and tell me
what I want?</font>

352
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, don't make me out
to be the bad guy here.</font>

353
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not the bad guy.</font>

354
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're never the bad guy,
are you?</font>

355
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You just step on people
and you use them!</font>

356
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going too far, dude.</font>

357
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is, like,
totally not necessary.</font>

358
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going too far?
What is wrong with you?</font>

359
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wasn't part of the plan.</font>

360
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what, Craig!
Love doesn't follow a plan!</font>

361
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

362
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was totally wrong about you.</font>

363
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I opened myself up
and let you in.</font>

364
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've got spikes, man.</font>

365
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got spikes.</font>

366
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek!</font>

367
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, seriously? Seriously?</font>

368
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Say something ♪</font>

369
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ I'm giving up on you ♪</font>

370
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">They... They broke up?</font>

378
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
This place isn't you.</font>

379
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just here
to pick up on guys.</font>

380
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Are you jealous?</font>

381
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not.</font>

382
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here because
we need you right now.</font>

383
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now you need me, huh?
Fuck you, dude.</font>

384
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

385
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that kid doing here?</font>

386
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just kind of
talking to himself.</font>

387
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole town is sad.
Cupid Me, you have to help.</font>

388
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess I could
try and help.</font>

389
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">In return forjust one date?</font>

390
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not homosexual!</font>

391
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess I'm not interested.</font>

392
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. One date.</font>

393
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But only if you help get
Tweek and Craig back together.</font>

394
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee!
Tee hee hee hee hee!</font>

395
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, kid, what do you
think you're doing here?</font>

396
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

397
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not here for me.
I'm here for my friend, okay?</font>

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Ls Craig here, sir?</font>

399
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you quit him?</font>

400
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas.</font>

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five minutes. He's in the back.</font>

402
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dude.</font>

403
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

404
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought when we broke up
everything would get better.</font>

405
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking maybe we
should say we're back together.</font>

406
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I'm not gay,
and neither are you!</font>

407
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that have
to do with anything?</font>

408
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can just pull
that shit you pulled at school,</font>

409
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">saying I step on people
and use them,</font>

410
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll just take you back?</font>

411
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said to make it seem real.</font>

412
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that real!</font>

413
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now everyone thinks
I'm a manipulative cheater.</font>

414
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never get any chicks.</font>

415
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry, Craig.</font>

416
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You made me
believe in myself</font>

417
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a way I never have before.</font>

418
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think I had any of that
in me, but you were right.</font>

419
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do more than I think.</font>

420
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You changed something in me,
and I just...</font>

421
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to fix whatever's
hurting you now.</font>

422
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be something
because everyone wants me to be.</font>

423
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to be myself.</font>

424
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll just have to go
be gay with someone else.</font>

425
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Craig. All right.</font>

426
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see how much
they're both hurting, but...</font>

427
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you understand that in my
time we just didn't accept this?</font>

428
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's not so wrong.</font>

429
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just don't
want it to be my son.</font>

430
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee! Tee hee hee!</font>

431
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just need
a little prick of magic.</font>

432
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna pee in
your mouth a little bit.</font>

433
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then again,
he's my son no matter what.</font>

434
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't just shut down on him.</font>

435
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tee hee hee! Tee hee hee hee!</font>

436
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son, you need to listen to me.</font>

437
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fight being gay.</font>

438
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to think that
being gay was a choice,</font>

439
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't get to decide.</font>

440
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Japan picks who they pick,
and that's that.</font>

441
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand this stuff.</font>

442
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heck, I didn't even know
Don King got raped,</font>

443
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do know that
if you try and resist it,</font>

444
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">you make yourself miserable
your whole life.</font>
