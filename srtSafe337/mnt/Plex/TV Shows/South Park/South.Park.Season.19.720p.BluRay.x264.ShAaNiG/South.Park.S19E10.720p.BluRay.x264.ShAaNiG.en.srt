wasn't human.</font>

Then what?</font>

94
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,173

I am well beyond that.</font>

100
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
Don't you see what this means?</font>

101
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,822

108
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, everyone's getting
one of these now, Jim.</font>

109
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,552

110
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well,
guns are never the answer.</font>

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you kind of wish
you'd had one</font>

112

113
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I guess it would have been
a decent answer then.</font>

expensive tastes, Jimmy.</font>

116
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like good food,

Classi.</font>

124
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,456

was work for the ads,</font>

125
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got
everything I wanted —</font>

126
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">My own loft with all of
ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep.</font>

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">All it took was some PC, and the
whole thing was set in motion.</font>

128
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great.</font>

129
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, now ads are using PC

130
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:12,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a new low.</font>

131
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is PC but a verbal form
of gentrification?</font>

132
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spruce everything up,
get rid of all the ugliness</font>

133
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to create
a false sense of paradise.</font>

134
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one thing can actually live
in that world — ads.</font>

135
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:31,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I've set it before,
but man, do I hate ads.</font>

136
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Cartman, I told you

137
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,533

I'm into this movie.</font>

140
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to bed
right now. Chillax.</font>

141
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You most certainly are.</font>

142
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, mister!</font>

143
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will go to bed

144
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric!
Where did you get that?</font>

145
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn off the light
and go back to bed.</font>

146
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm staying up.</font>

147
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, you march right up
to your room, and you —</font>

148
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so, Mom.</font>

151
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to go upstairs
right now!</font>

152
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, Mom,
what the hell?</font>

153
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to
tell you again, Eric.</font>

154
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is time
for night-night!</font>

155
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,065

158
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,038

something —</font>

165
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">some clue as to what
we're dealing with.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The news stories
PC Principal researched</font>

167

these things are</font>

like vampires to me.</font>

171
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to find out who had me
fired with the Cosby joke.</font>

172

179
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,322

I couldn't trust you.</font>

183
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, it isn't
what you think.</font>

184
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what is it?</font>

185
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I need to show you
something, okay?</font>

186
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need
to see this, son.</font>

187
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:25,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh! Psych! Now put
the fucking gun down, bitch!</font>

188
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:25,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go tell Mom!</font>

189
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?
You go tell her.</font>

190
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:27,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you had a gun.</font>

191
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be
in more trouble than me!</font>

192
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, I am your dad.</font>

193
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:35,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the gun down
and sit over there.</font>

194

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom!
Shit!</font>

195
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took a lot to hunt you down,
PC Principal.</font>

196
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind telling me why you're
going around the world</font>

197

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Mr. President.</font>

206
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see, sir.
Yes, I understand.</font>

207
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're to release him
immediately —</font>

208
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">No questions asked.</font>

209
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,696

believe anything he tells us.</font>

210
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.
Ain't that a peach?</font>

211
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's being set free now,
Mr. President.</font>

212
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I tell
the commander why?</font>

213
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a matter
of national security.</font>

214
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand, sir.</font>

215

219
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, just

happen to you.</font>

225
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warning you — You're on
the wrong side of this.</font>

226
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just trying
to get answers.</font>

227
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pulled a gun
on our son, Randy!</font>

228
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">He pulled one
on me first, Sharon!</font>

229
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you wouldn't
talk to me, Dad!</font>

230
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stanley, let your mother and I
deal with this.</font>

231
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you
to leave him alone!</font>

232
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">God,
I hate this family!</font>

233
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you always
taking Stan's side?</font>

234
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Whoa! Shelly!</font>

235
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put down the gun,
Shelly!</font>

236
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're always acting like Stan
can't do anything wrong!</font>

237
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't always
take my side!</font>

238
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shut up or I swear to God
I'll use this.</font>

239
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shelly,
put it down now.</font>

240
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even try
to know me, Dad!</font>

241
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to, Shelly!</font>

242
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just sometimes feel
like you hate me!</font>

243
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like
<i>you</i> hate<i> me,</i> Randy!</font>

244
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't hate you!
I love you!</font>

245
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be a better husband,
a better father!</font>

246
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all need to be better
to each other!</font>

247
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, maybe I need
to stop being so angry!</font>

248
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you guys.</font>

249
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">We love you,

250
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just want to know
what's going on with you.</font>

251
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
I'll tell you everything.</font>

252
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. These things
are amazing.</font>

253
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,

feel more at ease.</font>

260
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you ought to
check out the gun show.</font>

261
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gun show?</font>

262
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's gonna have
everything,</font>

00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to get
in front of everyone</font>

297
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell them
what you've learned!</font>

298
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... gave up
giving speeches.</font>

299
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why?</font>

300
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to you
because I had heard</font>

301
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">how good you were
at getting messages across.</font>

302
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">That and because...
I thought you were cute.</font>

303
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I'd have no problem
giving a speech</font>

304
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you could be
by my side.</font>

305
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, I can't go with you,
you know. It's too dangerous.</font>

306
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:12,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if we go somewhere</font>

307
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's completely safe
from any violence.</font>

308
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?
The gun show.</font>

309
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gun show?</font>

310
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be so many guns
that nothing bad can happen.</font>

311
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone purposely had
Principal Victoria replaced</font>

312
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the new principal?</font>

313
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they wanted
to use his PC</font>

314
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a means to start
gentrification in our town.</font>

315
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we thought
PC Principal was behind it,</font>

316
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now we know they were just
using his PC abilities</font>

317
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">to service
their own needs.</font>

318
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the pussy crusher story
came out in<i> Super School News,</i></font>

319
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">it started to make PC Principal
question himself.</font>

320
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">He started digging for answers.
They didn't like that.</font>

321
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, they tried to distract
and mislead him with this.</font>

322
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Wait. That's an ad
for McDonald's. Hold on.</font>

323
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">With this —
Ugh, there's that ad again.</font>

324
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, these things
are annoying.</font>

325
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways,
whatever these beings are,</font>

326
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,168

327
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, I don't want to see
a slide show.</font>

328
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">PC Principal said something
was trying to divert</font>

It's Kyle.</font>

They're together.</font>

334
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,356

336
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then,
it's time to go ask Kyle</font>

337
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">why he sold out
his own kind.</font>

338
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will we get him
to talk?</font>

339
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to kill him
with kindness.</font>

340
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">But instead of kindness,
we're going to use guns.</font>

Yeah!</font>

418
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, Kyle.
You're the enemy.</font>

419
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've both got it wrong.</font>

420

<font color="#FFFFFF">They've
become sentient!</font>

429
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've taken
human form.</font>

430
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:06,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell what's human
and what's an ad anymore.</font>

431
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez.
Are you serious?</font>

432
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed to

<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me
Jimmy was dead.</font>

436

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mackey?</font>

440
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I wanted
Principle Victoria fired,</font>

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always telling me
what to do.</font>

445
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had problems with me,
why didn't you just talk to me?</font>

446
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never listened!</font>

447
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody listens to me!</font>

448
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just expect me
to listen to<i> them!</i></font>

449
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should
have realized</font>

450
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">that sometimes a counselor
needs counseling!</font>

451
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Maybe I got manipulated</font>

452
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">by these ads,
too, somehow,</font>

453
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I should have been
a better person!</font>

454
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:02,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all could be better people —
all of us!</font>

455
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all played a part.</font>

456
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe from now on people in this
town need to communicate more!</font>

457
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Care about each other!</font>

458
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're going to defeat
our enemies,</font>

459
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's what it's going to
take — all of us, together!</font>

460
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only we'd had these
before, huh?</font>

461
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time you block us,
we get smarter.</font>

462
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time you try to stop us,
we are more.</font>

463
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">If one plan fails,
we will plan another.</font>

464
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will never
be rid of ads.</font>

465
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Leslie!</font>

466
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your species took PC and
twisted it for evil purposes.</font>

467
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">That pisses me off!</font>

468
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're expelled.</font>

469
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, dude!</font>

470
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:02,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess there's just
one last thing to take care of.</font>

471
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did it have to be
like this?</font>

472
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:11,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why couldn't we try to live
on this planet together?</font>

473
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:18,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we're not perfect beings,
but we built a better town!</font>

474
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't need you
to do that!</font>

475
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll keep on trying
to make it better!</font>

476
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, you're yelling
at a Whole Foods.</font>

477
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on! Get out of here!</font>

478
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know!</font>

479
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Others will know!</font>

480
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:36,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't going to be so easy,
not anymore.</font>

481
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right everyone, listen up.</font>

482
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about you,
but I, for one,</font>

483
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">am sick and tired
of all the hate speech</font>

484
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">and microaggressions
against our species.</font>

485
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a new enemy out there —
an almost invisible foe</font>

486
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is so bigoted,
so racially biased,</font>

487
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">they actually think
we should all die.</font>

488
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are trying
to attract our youth,</font>

489
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">using tactics that are
underhanded and unfair.</font>

490
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no matter how hard
they hit us,</font>

491
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">we cannot let them take
from us our PC.</font>

492
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so, I have been asked
to stay on as your principal.</font>

493
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of changes will happen
in the coming months.</font>

494
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bottom line is
that the only thing</font>

495
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">that distinguishes
those who want to kill us</font>

496
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">from those who don't is
that we have the burning desire</font>

497
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">for social justice.</font>

498
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are at war,
but the only way to win this war</font>

499
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to be as understanding,
non-biased,</font>

500
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">and politically correct
as possible.</font>

501
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be
really hard.</font>

502
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one thing
we<i> can</i> do.</font>

503
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get guns.</font>

504
00:21:58,384 --> 00:21:58,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guns?</font>

505
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only way for us
to be safe.</font>

506
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, even if we thought
it could help protect us,</font>

507
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">how are we all going to
get our hands on guns?</font>

508
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:06,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, cool. We got guns.
So, now what?</font>
