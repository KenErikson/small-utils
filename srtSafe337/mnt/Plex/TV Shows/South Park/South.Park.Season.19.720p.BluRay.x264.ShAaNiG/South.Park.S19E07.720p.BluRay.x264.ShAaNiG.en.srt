<font color="#FFFFFF">Where should I go?</font>

50
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,288

that before you shot a Mexican.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Latino American.</font>

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Latino American. Shit.</font>

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should go away.</font>

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't belong anywhere in a
town as progressive as this one.</font>

55
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:20,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, quiet down over
there. I'm trying to sleep.</font>

56

all get out of here!</font>

57
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you in charge?</font>

58
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause this is my fucking house!</font>

59
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:29,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, beat it, man, or
I'll make you my bitch!</font>

60
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

61
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:34,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we've got a bunch
of drug-addict vagrants</font>

62
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trespassing in our yard,
and we need assistance.</font>

63
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that so?</font>

64
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'd like to come help you,</font>

65
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we don't want to get fired.</font>

66
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

67
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:46,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's homeless people here,
and they're scaring my kids.</font>

68
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to come do
something about this.</font>

69
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

70
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are any of these homeless
people of a minority persuasion?</font>

71
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does that matter?</font>

72
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it matters.</font>

73
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, used to be we could beat
up minorities, and nobody cared.</font>

74
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the reason a lot
of us joined the force.</font>

75
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:02,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mitch, you want to go down
and arrest some homeless people,</font>

76
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not be able to
beat up any minorities?</font>

77
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:05,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

78
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, I think we're good.</font>

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning
the whole department into a hula school.</font>

80
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:11,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

81
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

82
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they doing?</font>

83
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not coming!</font>

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they have to!</font>

85
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Karen brought in one of their
syringes, for Christ's sake!</font>

86
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:22,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just too bad.</font>

87
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cops won't come,</font>

88
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's nobody to
scare the homeless away.</font>

89
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sweetheart.</font>

90
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:44,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've, uh... I've been
let go from the force.</font>

91
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

92
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, old girl.</font>

93
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:53,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might be a little tough
to afford your medication,</font>

94
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'll find a way.</font>

95
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:58,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know me.</font>

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to help.</font>

97
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to be needed.</font>

98
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,021

99
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, they're gay!
They're totally gay.</font>

100
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- Kenny and Token.</font>

101
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

102
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kenny and Token, dude. They're
so gay. Butters told me.</font>

103
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're lying.
- No, dude.</font>

104
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">In those old, abandoned
buildings around Kenny's house,</font>

105
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kenny and Token turned it
into a big ninja clubhouse,</font>

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they dress up and play ninja
in it, trying to scare people away.</font>

107
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that gay?</font>

108
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:29,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the gayest thing ever, dude!</font>

109
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ninjas are fucking dumb!</font>

110
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, come on! We got to go see this!</font>

111
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,088

117
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, did you come
to see our ninja fortress?</font>

118
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
They're so gay, you guys.</font>

119
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Kenny built all this?</font>

120
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:55,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, with Clyde and David, too.</font>

121
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys should come and check it out.</font>

122
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no. We're good, thanks.</font>

123
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, dude. It's a sausage party.</font>

124
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:03,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty cool, dude.
People are really scared of us.</font>

125
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm sure they are.</font>

126
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, excuse me, man.
Do you know where...</font>

127
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:16,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Aahhhh!</font>

128
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

129
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty cool.</font>

131
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the way I heard it was
that the girl in the school</font>

132
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't even doing anything,
just talking too loud,</font>

133
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">And someone ends up getting shot.</font>

134
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! What do you want?</font>

135
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. I'm off-duty.</font>

136
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just came for a nice Pinot.</font>

137
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Well, go somewhere else, copper.</font>

138

racist, trigger-happy assholes.</font>

142

<font color="#FFFFFF">You must promise to
uphold the warrior's code.</font>

152
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally, dude. Ninjas are sweet.</font>

153
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:26,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together, we must strive to
make our fortress super badass</font>

154
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">And keep all intruders out.</font>

155
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:31,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">To that end, let us
proceed to our training.</font>

156
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:35,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, can I talk to you for a minute?</font>

157
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I don't think we should
let Kyle be a ninja, okay?</font>

158
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:40,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said ninjas were gay.</font>

159
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's probably gonna try
to turn it around on me,</font>

160
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:44,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's 'cause
Kyle knows I heard him.</font>

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking to Kyle right now.</font>

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, cool.</font>

163
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me... Butters.</font>

164
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who said ninjas were gay.</font>

165
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you want to make this a problem?</font>

166
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm... I'm just Butters, man. I
have problems with lots of things.</font>

167
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Eric, you want to
try sparring with me?</font>

168
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:58,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes I do, Butters.</font>

169
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh! Ow!</font>

170
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intruders!</font>

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's right up here.</font>

172
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can shoot up in these
abandoned buildings.</font>

00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Aah! Aah. Aah!</font>

00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,788

kids in the town of South Park</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Are swearing loyalty

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're pretty badass,</font>

00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,184

<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can see it's pretty cool.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about this way
of life is attractive to you?</font>

213
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just
cool 'cause we're tough,</font>

00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,067

215
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah! And it's
like we can do whatever we want,</font>

216
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,950

of us. It's totally rad.</font>

217
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why did you say it was gay before?</font>

218
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:16,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! I never said it was gay!</font>

219
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, he said this was gay?</font>

220
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a total lie!</font>

221
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,250

225
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be problematic
for the progressive town.</font>

00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go, old girl.</font>

227

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew!</font>

229
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:47,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare a dollar?</font>

230
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't. I'm sorry. Thank you.</font>

231
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it. Ew.</font>

232
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mayor, I didn't bust my ass
to gentrify this part of town</font>

233
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have it overrun with homeless people.</font>

234
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they all suddenly coming here?</font>

235
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mayor, what are you
going to do about this?</font>

236
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife and I can barely eat or shop.</font>

237
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a town like ours
has a homeless problem,</font>

238
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must look at the root
of what's causing it.</font>

239
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's ISIS!
- What?</font>

240
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:13,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's these troubled kids who've
turned their backs on America.</font>

241
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:16,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've taken over SodoSoPa,
forced all the homeless out.</font>

242
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:18,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would kids in our town
want to be a part of that?</font>

243
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just bad kids,</font>

244
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">rotten on the inside,
probably with shitty parents.</font>

245
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:29,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad.</font>

246
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:33,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I don't want to make
you angry, but why?</font>

247
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:37,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well dad, I just r-r-really
like being a part of something.</font>

248
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like it's character-building,
and it's lots of fun.</font>

249
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fun?</font>

250
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what do you... believe in?</font>

251
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we believe in?</font>

252
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe in something
greater than ourselves,</font>

253
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that by following
our strict warrior code,</font>

254
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:51,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe that our
faiths and our traditions</font>

255
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:54,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are a way to a greater path...
the p-p-path of the warrior.</font>

256
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as long as we stay united in honor,</font>

257
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can defeat all our enemies.</font>

258
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waghgh waaaaghghhhg!</font>

259
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:02,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. The fellas were right.</font>

260
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are really freaked out by ninjas.</font>

261
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we've just got
to be really apologetic</font>

262
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell them we didn't mean it, okay?</font>

263
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:12,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez. This is so embarrassing.</font>

264
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they won't help
us with the homeless?</font>

265
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure the police will help out if
it's because ISIS is taking over the town.</font>

266
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:29,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officers, there's kids in
town who have joined ISIS:</font>

267
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know who they are, but they...</font>

268
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What's that, you say?</font>

269
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">The town is in danger, all right?</font>

270
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know what these
kids are capable of.</font>

271
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez. I'm sorry.</font>

272
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:42,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to work on our Kaholo Koloa</font>

273
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:45,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get the lomilomi chicken
ready for the big Ho'olaule'a,</font>

274
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which leaves us, oh,</font>

275
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not enough time to deal with ISIS:</font>

276
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look, there's homeless people</font>

277
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">All over our gentrified
food-and-arts district.</font>

278
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't stop these
twisted kids, then...</font>

279
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, who was it that
said fuck the police?</font>

280
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that Ice Cube? Tupac?</font>

281
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:02,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right. That was you guys.</font>

282
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, but I guess you'll
have to find somebody else</font>

283
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do all the difficult, dirty shit
you don't want to do yourselves.</font>

284
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:11,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to be ready for the luau.</font>

285
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might even kiss a dude.</font>

286
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, then, after you told me, we
both went over to Kyle and Stan,</font>

287
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">where they were playing
basketball, remember?</font>

288
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

289
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we said Kenny and
Token were playing ninja,</font>

290
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Kyle said that ninjas were gay.</font>

291
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:28,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said, "Ninjas are
gay?" But it was a question.</font>

292
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:29,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember?</font>

293
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said it first.</font>

294
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no. See, now, Kyle's
got everyone remembering it wrong</font>

295
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he doesn't want to
get kicked out of the group.</font>

296
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Jews do when
they're caught in a lie.</font>

297
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot trust a
Jewish ninja, Butters.</font>

298
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys, you guys!</font>

299
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:41,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

300
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Actual ninjas want to talk to us.
- What?</font>

301
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kenny and I both just got the
same e-mail from people overseas.</font>

302
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, dude!</font>

303
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd they find out who we were?</font>

304
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're fucking ninjas, dude!</font>

305
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:58,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you are the brave children
who have committed to our cause.</font>

306
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have heard of what you are doing,</font>

307
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are very impressed.</font>

308
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:03,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Thanks, dude.</font>

309
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you are doing is very important,</font>

310
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we would like to
help you however we can.</font>

311
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:10,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are going to be
wiring you some money.</font>

312
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Cool!</font>

313
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the greatest
thing ever, you guys!</font>

314
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me, could I just set
the record straight on something?</font>

315
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

316
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should Jews be trusted?</font>

317
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:26,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if one of us is a Jew,</font>

318
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see that as
being at all problematic?</font>

319
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extremely.</font>

320
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

321
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:33,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

322
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh, oh, oh!</font>

323
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you guys? Thank you!</font>

324
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Barbrady.</font>

325
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:49,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer Barbrady?</font>

326
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha... who?</font>

327
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy.</font>

328
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:56,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

329
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:59,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to
be a policeman again?</font>

330
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no good as a policeman.</font>

331
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bumbling, old fool.</font>

332
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:06,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not true. Who said that?</font>

333
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:10,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Barbrady, the fact
is, the town needs you.</font>

334
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need me? To do what?</font>

335
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:17,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you to shoot some kids.</font>

336
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Shoot kids?</font>

337
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to shoot kids!</font>

338
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:26,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are really bad kids... terrorists.</font>

339
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is totally different from before.</font>

340
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

341
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are any of them minorities?</font>

342
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">A couple of them we think, yeah.</font>

343
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

344
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, look, look! Barbrady! Barbrady!</font>

345
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:43,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were wrong about you.
I was wrong about you.</font>

346
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:48,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You protected this town back
before anybody else ever did.</font>

347
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used to do it all on your own.</font>

348
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you to do that again.</font>

349
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:07,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only cop this
town needs, Barbrady.</font>

350
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go shoot those kids.</font>

351
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I know
this is hard for all of us,</font>

352
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:20,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to truly be ninjas,
we must face hard facts.</font>

353
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:24,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, I spoke in private
with our ninja leader overseas.</font>

354
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talked a long time about
Jews and the Hebrew faith.</font>

355
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me a lot I didn't know,</font>

356
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:31,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was able to tell him
some things he did not know.</font>

357
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after talking with that guy,</font>

358
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:37,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is abundantly clear to me
that Jews cannot be ninjas.</font>

359
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:39,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to Kyle's house
to talk to him about it,</font>

360
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I found this.</font>

361
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was then that Kyle confessed to me</font>

362
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">About how he had brainwashed
Butters and Stan into thinking</font>

363
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had used a homophobic slur
to refer to our organization.</font>

364
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he almost got away with it.</font>

365
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when Kyle tried to kill me.</font>

366
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily, I was the faster ninja.</font>

367
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay.</font>

368
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I take the gag off,</font>

369
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to try and tell
you that I'm lying now.</font>

370
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:05,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.</font>

371
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:07,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right here.</font>

372
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who... Who's this?</font>

373
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Clyde.</font>

374
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I am Token.</font>

375
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do I do these things, you ask?</font>

376
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black rage.</font>

377
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus.</font>

378
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

379
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:39,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">This chicken tastes like
shit. What'd you do to it?</font>

380
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:42,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay... Okay, Dad, it's
not organic chicken.</font>

381
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not comfortable
shopping at Whole Foods</font>

382
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all the homeless people there.</font>

383
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't worry, that's
all about to change.</font>

384
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:52,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon we'll all have
ShiTpaTown to enjoy again.</font>

385
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Stan?</font>

386
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's playing ninjas
over at Kenny's house.</font>

387
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ninjas? That's gay.</font>

388
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?</font>

389
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- You mean SodoSoPa?</font>

390
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute...</font>

391
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ninjas...</font>

392
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary...</font>

393
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay...</font>

394
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary...</font>

395
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:26,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay.</font>

396
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary. Gay.</font>

397
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:28,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary. Gay.</font>

398
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:29,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy what are you doing?</font>

399
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary. Gay.</font>

400
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:31,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary.</font>

401
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:31,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay.</font>

402
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:32,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scary.</font>

403
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:32,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gay!</font>

404
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Staaaan!</font>

405
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:37,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I get the
misunderstanding now!</font>

406
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:40,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, see, I told Clyde that
Kyle said ninjas were gay,</font>

407
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Clyde thought I was Kyle,</font>

408
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then he was saying that
I said ninjas were gay.</font>

409
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meaning I as in Kyle.</font>

410
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody ever gave
a shit, you fat turd.</font>

411
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those in favor of Cartman
being kicked out of our ninjas club?</font>

412
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:52,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hai!</font>

413
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! You can't kick me out!</font>

414
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:55,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to be a ninja.</font>

415
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">They hate Jews. I was
made for this, you guys!</font>

416
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

417
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">What should we do with him?</font>

418
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze!</font>

419
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

420
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:04,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please! I don't want to shoot you!</font>

421
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:06,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Don't.</font>

422
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:11,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you're
feeling angry at this town.</font>

423
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting pretty angry, too!</font>

424
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we can't give up on it.</font>

425
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, boys...</font>

426
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make this end violently.</font>

427
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just stupid ninjas!</font>

428
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

429
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aaaah!</font>

430
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you thinking?</font>

431
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:38,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys innocently playing ninja,
and you pull your gun on them?</font>

432
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:41,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">David Rodriguez was lucky to live.</font>

433
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody told me they were terrorists!</font>

434
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought they were!</font>

435
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it turns out they
aren't, as a policeman,</font>

436
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:49,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to figure that out!</font>

437
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... You said you needed
me to kill some kids!</font>

438
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now.</font>

439
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said "kill some kids,"</font>

440
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I said it as a question, remember?</font>

441
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:00,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "Kill some kids?"</font>

442
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but we just can't
cover your ass on this one.</font>

443
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's going to be
an investigation and...</font>

444
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just don't have what it takes</font>

445
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:11,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be a policeman in today's times.</font>

446
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you even know what
"farm to table" means?</font>

447
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, people. You can't stay here.</font>

448
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:25,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are being relocated.</font>

449
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:27,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.</font>

450
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:29,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no? I'm a cop.</font>

451
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, officers.</font>

452
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a deal, right?</font>

453
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

454
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:36,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you. Come on.</font>

455
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:38,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

456
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please! You can't take
me back to SodoSoPa!</font>

457
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:53,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">ISIS is there!</font>

458
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, those were just ninjas.</font>

459
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ninjas?</font>

460
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:59,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's so gay.</font>

461
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you guys.</font>

462
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I tell you?</font>

463
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:03,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said ninjas are fucking gay,</font>

464
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you didn't want to listen.</font>

465
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:05,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nooo.</font>

466
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer Barbrady?</font>

467
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:15,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

468
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been watching you.</font>

469
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what we see</font>

470
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:22,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is a man who truly wants
to protect his town.</font>

471
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

472
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been in this town
longer than almost anyone.</font>

473
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you noticed... changes lately?</font>

474
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a lot of changes.</font>

475
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">They aren't a coincidence, officer.</font>

476
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are all part of a plan</font>

477
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">To take down your beloved
town and everyone in it.</font>

478
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

479
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:44,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know about
a little girl named...</font>

480
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leslie?</font>
