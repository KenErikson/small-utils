it was pretty nasty.</font>

20
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,333

and you were right, kyle.</font>

Davin miller.</font>

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you an apology,
too, davin.</font>

25

humans weren't the only species</font>

00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure this occurs
only rarely in nature.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, cartman,
joke's over.</font>

46
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What joke? This is real.
- Tell everyone you made the cow</font>

47
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look like that.
- No! No, you were right, kyle.</font>

48
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong!
- Boy, eric.</font>

55
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, be sure to show
everyone, guys.</font>

56
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:19,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really amazing.</font>

57
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:24,009

Ah, too good, too, too good.</font>

big consequences.</font>

60
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,517

earth-shattering consequences.</font>

What you do, kyle?</font>

69
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kyle, these men have
apparently come</font>

70
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the way from israel
to speak with me,</font>

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we need a translator.</font>

72
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,216

73
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kyle, please try your best.
It seems pretty important.</font>

74
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">This boy... Mkay...
Is jew.</font>

75
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:21,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mkay? Jew like you.
Okay?</font>

76
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:26,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please...
Please try... Speak to jew.</font>

77
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just trying
to tell them</font>

78
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we come on very urgent
business.</font>

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Anything?</font>

80
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He said they come on
urgent business.</font>

81
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,578

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, we believe this school
has something</font>

83
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is of the utmost
important to our people.</font>

84
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wish to see the red cow.</font>

85
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The red—come on, you can't
possibly be here for that.</font>

86
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For what?
What did he say, kyle?</font>

87
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, you must understand.</font>

88
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fate of
the world is at stake.</font>

89
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">The coming of a red heifer
is the most holy sign</font>

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">In all of judaism.</font>

91
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">It signals the beginning
of the end.</font>

92
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not just our religion,</font>

93
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">But islam and christianity
as well.</font>

94
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all agree on one thing—</font>

95
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:13,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the red heifer
means the end of times.</font>

96
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you catch any of that,
kyle?</font>

97
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's right over here
by the—</font>

98
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my holy schmear!</font>

99
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The muslims,
they beat us here.</font>

100
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on, kyle?</font>

101
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He said the muslims
beat them here.</font>

102
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:32,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

103
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:35,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Step away.
You all know what this means.</font>

104
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes. And you know
you're about to die.</font>

105
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold on, everybody,
this thing isn't even—</font>

106
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't touch it!</font>

107
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I just ran to
the school and told everyone</font>

108
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, there's a red-headed cow
outside.</font>

109
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should all see it.
- Cartman, stop!</font>

110
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what
you're doing.</font>

111
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm pretty sure that this cow
can make ginger cheese</font>

112
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is like a swiss cheese,</font>

113
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except instead of holes
it has freckles.</font>

114
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- nooooo!</font>

115
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The muslims and the christians
are calling for a meeting</font>

116
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">To discuss the terms of war.</font>

117
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very well.
Let us meet to discuss</font>

118
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the world as we know it
ends.</font>

119
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, so far we agree</font>

120
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be
no automatic rifles,</font>

121
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">No shanks,
and no chemical weapons.</font>

122
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If there can be
no chemical weapons,</font>

123
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the christians can use
no nuclear weapons.</font>

124
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, come on.
Without nuclear weapons,</font>

125
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of final armageddon
is this gonna be?</font>

126
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- That's right!</font>

127
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could we agree on
non-ballistic nuclear only?</font>

128
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
- That makes sense.</font>

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Non-ballistic nuclear only.
All right.</font>

130
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now on to prisoners.</font>

131
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we all agreeing
to decapitations?</font>

132
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course we are!
What do you think this is?</font>

133
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, come on.</font>

134
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</font>

135
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone noticed something?</font>

136
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all in a room together,
talking.</font>

137
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has it occurred to anyone else
that this prophecy,</font>

138

<font color="#FFFFFF">Which amazingly
is in all three religions,</font>

139
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:10,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could actually be meant
to bring us together?</font>

140
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The prophecy says the red
heifer signals the end.</font>

141
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could it mean the end of war?</font>

142
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If the cow is sacrificed
in israel,</font>

143
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to the prophecy,</font>

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,208

bring about peace.</font>

00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Moooo!</font>

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After all the years
of holy wars and hatred,</font>

148

00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have met in israel
to sort out their differences.</font>

151
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may be a rocky road,</font>

152
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">But many say the chance
for peace is real</font>

153
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all because of a red cow
discovered by a young boy</font>

154
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here in the u.S.</font>

155
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, kyle,
you got a minute?</font>

156
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.</font>

157
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got to tell you
something, kyle.</font>

158
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">The red-headed cow...
Isn't real.</font>

159
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made him up.</font>

160
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No shit.
- I totally lied, kyle.</font>

161
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you asked me
if I lied</font>

162
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">I looked you right in the eye
and I said no.</font>

163
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you an apology,
and I mean it.</font>

164
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, it's okay.
There's no denying</font>

165
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all worked out
for the best this time.</font>

166
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! No, kyle, you said
it's never for the best.</font>

167
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that?
And you're right.</font>

168
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, kyle!
- Oh, no, no, no.</font>

169
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman, don't you do this.</font>

170
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">The middle east
is finally at peace.</font>

171
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But it's not true.
Kyle, I'm being serious.</font>

172
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really think I have
to tell the truth.</font>

173
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how I can live
with this.</font>

174
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I can unless...
Unless, I don't know,</font>

175
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you called
your mom a fat skank.</font>

176
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe if you said that
to your mom</font>

177
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">And told her her tits
belonged in a morgue,</font>

178
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then maybe somehow
I can live with this lie.</font>

179
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, go to hell!</font>

180
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're right.
You're right, kyle.</font>

181
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should just tell the truth
and be done with it.</font>

182
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait.</font>

183
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom.</font>

184
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, bubie.</font>

185
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mom, there's something
I need to tell you.</font>

186
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it, kyle?</font>

187
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a fat skank, mom.</font>

188
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">kyle, oh, my gosh!</font>

189
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you just say?</font>

190
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a fat skank mom, and
your tits belong in a morgue.</font>

191
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my god.</font>

192
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Broflovski, are you okay?</font>

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he always talk to you
like that?</font>

194
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:56,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, come on over here.</font>

195
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got some more stuff
in my locker, kyle.</font>

196
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How come you're carrying
cartman's stuff?</font>

197
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just thought
it would be nice.</font>

198
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kyle's doing all kinds of
things for me.</font>

199
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">He finished my homework, gave me
the soda from his lunch.</font>

200
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's just really
stoked on me</font>

201
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">For helping bring peace
to the middle east.</font>

202
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, kyle?
- Yes, sir.</font>

203
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, looks like
most everyone's here.</font>

204
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't there something you
wanted to say, kyle, remember,</font>

205
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">About the...
- Yes.</font>

206
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love cartman's farts.</font>

207
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You what?</font>

208
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yummy, yummy, yummy, I want
cartman's farts in my tummy.</font>

209
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, what the hell
are you talking about?</font>

210
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yummy, yummy, yummy,
can I please have</font>

211
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman's farts
in my tummy?</font>

212
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, okay!
Jesus.</font>

213
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lay down on your back,
kyle.</font>

214
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy...
- Let's see what I can</font>

215
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muster up here.
- Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy—</font>

216
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's see. Oh... Oh!</font>

217
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yummy, yummy.
Thank you, cartman.</font>

218
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What. The fuck?</font>

219
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on in.</font>

220
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey,
can I talk to you?</font>

221
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure,
kyle what's the matter?</font>

222
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you knew something
but couldn't tell anyone,</font>

223
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you do?</font>

224
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, kyle living with a lie
is never a good thing, mkay?</font>

225
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you maybe just tell me?</font>

226
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
Okay.</font>

227
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love having cartman's farts
in my tummy.</font>

228
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it.</font>

229
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it so, so much.</font>

230
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:30,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, why do you like his
farts in your tummy?</font>

231
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because they taste so yummy.</font>

232
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, kyle,
that's kind of odd.</font>

233
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not sure how to help you
with that.</font>

234
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey, could I—
oh, hey, sorry.</font>

235
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I interrupting?</font>

236
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not if you have some
delicious farts for me.</font>

237
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kyle, are you sure?</font>

238
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.</font>

239
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,809

298
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do you endure
all the farts, kyle?</font>

299
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I—because the world
is at peace.</font>

300
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must endure.</font>

301
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing</font>

302
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the most awesome
thing ever.</font>

303
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I... I know.</font>

304
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who else would take
such torment?</font>

305
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's—that's kinda
what I was thinking.</font>

306
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">- you should,
like, shave your head</font>

307
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get all peaceful about it.</font>

308
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sacrifice
saves the world.</font>

309
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.</font>

310
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I endure what I must for
the sake of all humanity.</font>

311
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ whoa!</font>

312
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ oh, yeah</font>

stop that screamin' ♪</font>

314
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ teacher, don't you see?</font>

315
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What can this reporter say</font>

316
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except that israel
freaking rocks.</font>

317
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things just keep getting
better here, tom.</font>

318
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in a few days,
they'll be honoring</font>

319
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little boy who discovered
the red cow here on stage,</font>

320
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">And things are gonna go off!</font>

321
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You gonna come with me
to israel, kyle?</font>

322
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- yes. Yes, I will.</font>

323
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh? You coming?</font>

324
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, whatever you want.</font>

325
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, I want
the whole world to see</font>

326
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much you love
my farts.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kyle, don't do this.</font>

329
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't eat cartman's farts
in front of the whole world.</font>

330
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just stop, please.</font>

331
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay.
Everyone, it's okay.</font>

332
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps one day
you will all understand.</font>

333
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I do,
I do because I care about</font>

334

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, now he
just sounds like</font>

336
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">A self righteous
asshole.</font>

337
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, kyle.
- Hello, stan.</font>

338
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, we need to talk.</font>

339
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has to stop.</font>

340
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There are greater things at
work than what you understand.</font>

341

<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you want to suck farts,
kyle, that's fine, go ahead.</font>

342
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can't suck farts
and be a dick about it.</font>

343
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm actually
the complete opposite.</font>

344
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All of a sudden
you seem to think</font>

345
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're above everyone else.
- I'm not better, I'm just...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">To make the world
a better place.</font>

348
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See? You sound like a dick.</font>

349
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,581

who's putting</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else's needs
before their own.</font>

351
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dick.
That's a dick talking.</font>

352
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've had too much
of cartman's fart.</font>

353
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got sulfur poisoning,
and now you're a dick.</font>

354
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All you need to know</font>

355
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is I'm way awesomer
than you think, okay?</font>

356
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't think kyle really
loves cartman's farts.</font>

357
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something else
going on.</font>

358
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">really? Like what?</font>

359
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This all started
with stupid peace</font>

360
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the middle east, kenny.</font>

361
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some reason,
it's making kyle crazy.</font>

362
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've gotta get
to the bottom of this.</font>

363
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And now, let us honor
the little boy</font>

364
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who helped make
all his happen—</font>

365
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric cartman and his
best friend, fart boy.</font>

366
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, everyone.</font>

367
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my honor to have been
a part of this miracle.</font>

368
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that right, fart boy?</font>

369
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could I please have one</font>

370
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of your piping hot farts
in my mouth?</font>

371
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure, fart boy?</font>

372
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had a lot of strange food
on this trip.</font>

373
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yummy, yummy.
I want your farts in my tummy.</font>

374
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me,
I'm sorry, everyone,</font>

375
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">But apparently
there's some breaking news</font>

376
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the United States.</font>

377
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're in colorado where
the red cow was discovered,</font>

378
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">And apparently two boys
have shocking news</font>

379
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">That might change
everything.</font>

380
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, there's something
that you all need to know.</font>

381
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth about the red cow.</font>

382
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have all been—</font>

383
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, hang on.</font>

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">hello?</font>

385
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, do not do this.</font>

386
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, dude,
you don't understand.</font>

387
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman hasn't been telling
the truth.</font>

388
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I know that!</font>

389
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think I've been
putting up with his farts?</font>

390
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh...</font>

391
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh what?</font>

392
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know cartman made it
all up, okay?</font>

393
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also know that nothing
is more important for humanity</font>

394
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Than peace
in the middle east.</font>

395
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay with this, stan.</font>

396
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I'm not okay with it,</font>

397
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause it's turned you
into a dick, kyle.</font>

398
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not a dick!
I'm like gandhi.</font>

399
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know, I don't think
when gandhi starved himself</font>

400
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was all, "dude, look how
fucking awesome I am</font>

401
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">For starving.
Check me out!"</font>

402
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, okay.
Stan, you're right.</font>

403
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I let being a martyr
go to my head.</font>

404
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just please, let me
stay on this path,</font>

405
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll try to be cool
about it.</font>

406
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?
I'm sorry.</font>

407
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You should apologize
to kenny too.</font>

408
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, kenny.</font>

409
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's okay, kyle!</font>

410
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is the new information?</font>

411
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The red cow...</font>

412
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it too.</font>

413
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">It came down from the sky
in a flash of light.</font>

414
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a miracle.</font>

415
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hooray!
- Oh, no, it was a miracle?</font>

416
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then it's not true.</font>

417
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prophecy is not true.</font>

418
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, I thought
we were all here</font>

419
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of the prophecy
of a miraculous red cow.</font>

420
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, the prophecy
is that one day a fat child</font>

421
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:26,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a small penis would
decorate a cow to look ginger.</font>

422
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that one would miraculously
just fall from the sky.</font>

423
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I knew this all
too good to be true.</font>

424
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're associating with these
heathens for no reason!</font>

425
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Small penis?</font>

426
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The party's over.</font>

427
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muslims, jews, and christians
are back at each other's throats</font>

428
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">And israel is once again
a place of conflict and turmoil.</font>

429
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, you have to
listen to me!</font>

430
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prophecy
actually did come true!</font>

431
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did!</font>

432
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The prophecy was a fat boy
with a small penis</font>

433
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:58,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would one day decorate a cow
to look ginger.</font>

434
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have known
a prophecy like this</font>

435
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was too impossible
to ever come to be.</font>

436
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But that is what happened.
It is!</font>

437
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them, cartman.</font>

438
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, kyle, you were right.</font>

439
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:13,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see now that little lies
can cause huge problems.</font>

440
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But it's the truth!
- No, it's not, kyle.</font>

441
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a huge dick.</font>

442
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, boys, but we
gotta get to a fight.</font>

443
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a rumble
at the wailing wall.</font>

444
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,651
