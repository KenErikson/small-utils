00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the dragons show up?
- Nothing!</font>

151
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dragons are just
still on their way!</font>

152
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:03,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">They keep promising dragons,</font>

153
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,999

floppy wieners in my face.</font>

the key to our victory</font>

156
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to know what happens
when the dragons show up</font>

157
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I know how to deal
with kenny.</font>

sir scott malkinson</font>

george r.R. Martin for answers.</font>

163
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's the guy who writes
<i>games of thrones,</i> butters!</font>

how to handle kenny</font>

clyde or not.</font>

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is really about
you and me getting xboxes.</font>

168

We're trying to talk here.</font>

173
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah? Well, how come every
time you talk to somebody</font>

174
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's about betraying
somebody else?</font>

175

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you mind
your own business?</font>

176
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, listen,
for the last time,</font>

177
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">we don't have any dragons
to send them.</font>

showing up at corporate.</font>

- Not bad, you know,</font>

185
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,999

next gen press stuff handled.</font>

a little trouble in, uh...</font>

187

- No, it turns out</font>

188
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:16,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was nothing,
just some kids trying to</font>

189
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">turn the console wars
into something bigger.</font>

190
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my gosh.
You know, when I stepped down</font>

191
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:22,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">and left you in charge
of the company, steve,</font>

192
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew there might be
some challenges for you.</font>

193

I can't handle.</font>

194
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:28,999

to make to our marketing,</font>

195

- Uh-huh...</font>

196

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think we'll ultimately sell
the number of units we want to.</font>

197
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:36,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're right, steve.
Some changes do need to be made.</font>

198
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know what
weakness is, steve?</font>

199
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:52,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weakness is believing
that competition is healthy.</font>

200
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, there was a time</font>

201
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">when xboxes and playstations
could both survive in this world</font>

202
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:57,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that time's done.</font>

203

watch tv on, socialize on.</font>

one winner.</font>

throwing away</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">everything I worked so hard
to achieve.</font>

208

209
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, scott,
you're lagging.</font>

210
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,999

I need to eat.</font>

then we can hit a mcdonalds.</font>

213
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,999

- Hello?</font>

214
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this george r.R. Martin's
house?</font>

215
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:35,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is this, please?</font>

216
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's two kids who want to know
what happens</font>

217
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the dragons show up.</font>

218
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

219
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, but mr. Martin
does not see fans.</font>

220
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not fans!
- Yeah! We don't like it!</font>

221
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't like it,
and I'm pretty pissed off,</font>

222
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you want to know
the truth.</font>

223
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- About what?
- Let me talk to</font>

224
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">george r.R. Martin,
and I'll tell him about what.</font>

225
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the red wedding,
isn't it?</font>

226
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hate how I killed
everyone off?</font>

227
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir, we just really need
to know about the dragons,</font>

228
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they never
seem to show up.</font>

229
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, they're coming.
The dragons are on their way.</font>

230
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When?
- You really want to know?</font>

231
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please! It's urgent.</font>

232
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right. King joffrey
is still at king's landing,</font>

233
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:19,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's a young blacksmith</font>

234
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wakes up one morning
with a plan,</font>

235
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his wiener gently hangs
down between his legs.</font>

236
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soft and flaccid, his weiner
glistens in the golden sunlight.</font>

237
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:29,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! Can we skip
the wiener stuff</font>

238
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just get to the dragons?</font>

239
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw, shit, I think—
I think I'm going faint.</font>

240
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the matter, scott?
- I told you I have to eat</font>

241
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">every two hours!
- He's diabetic.</font>

242
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, jeez! Why don't you
kids come out of the cold?</font>

243
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll order us some pizzas.
- Okay, thanks.</font>

244
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on in—
I'll tell you everything</font>

245
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:46,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's going to happen
in <i>game of thrones.</i></font>

246
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir kyle, I wanted to talk
to you about stan.</font>

247
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:58,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you want to make sure
I'm not</font>

248
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">switching sides, cartman,
you don't have to worry.</font>

249
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan is wrong.
- It isn't that.</font>

250
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess kenny
is loved by her army,</font>

251
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">but stan is still the nuts
and balls of the operation.</font>

252
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be a huge setback
to the traitors</font>

253
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting their playstations
if stan were to be...</font>

254
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grounded?</font>

255
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Grounded? For what?</font>

256
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That could be up to you.
- No, cartman.</font>

257
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said nobody
would have to be grounded.</font>

258
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not playing dirty.</font>

259
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine, sir kyle.
Perhaps you're right.</font>

260
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that stan's dad
is working a temp job</font>

261
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">as mall security?
- What?</font>

262
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seems a little convenient,
doesn't it?</font>

263
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan with somebody on the inside
to help him get his ps4s?</font>

264
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's playing dirty now?</font>

265
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's face it sir kyle,</font>

266
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:37,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is all about you and me
getting xboxes.</font>

267
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest are simply there to
help us get through those doors.</font>

268
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't believe it!</font>

269
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said that
to a bunch of people.</font>

270
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, you better stop
harassing me,</font>

271
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'm calling the cops.</font>

272
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're calling the cops?
- Yeah!</font>

273
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're on my property!
I'm calling the cops.</font>

274
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, go ahead!
Call the cops then!</font>

275
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!</font>

276
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's you.</font>

277
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tom, I'm standing
in your doorway</font>

278
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:10,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we have a hot
news story to report.</font>

279
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't go to work
for another hour.</font>

280
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just got a call
from bill gates.</font>

281
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he can promise us
a bigger war on black friday</font>

282
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we play along.</font>

283
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He wants us to side with him?
- That's right, tammy.</font>

284
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:25,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not forget that having
a blood bath on black friday</font>

285
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">is good for the news.
It's good for us.</font>

286
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,439

not make it more violent.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, tom, because
you're so about integrity.</font>

289
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

290
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I should let
everyone in the newsroom</font>

291
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">know what their
two anchors are up to.</font>

00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the morning news
with tom and tammy thompson,</font>

294
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:53,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">colorado's top-rated
brother-sister news team.</font>

295
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, black friday
is just around the corner,</font>

296
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, tammy, it's getting
fierce out there.</font>

297
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right, niles
laughton is out at the mall</font>

298
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a little
holiday surprise.</font>

299
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tammy, the excitement
over black friday is peaking,</font>

300
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and none other than
bill gates himself</font>

301
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">has shown up to try
to make it even bigger.</font>

302
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right, we just
want to do whatever we can</font>

303
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help our supporters
get their xboxes</font>

304
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">at incredible deals on friday.</font>

305
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we've come to offer swords
and battle axes,</font>

306
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever the kids can carry</font>

307
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help them fight their way
through the other shoppers.</font>

308
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We understand
that you've donated some guns</font>

309
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the kids as well.</font>

310
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, but we are limiting it
to one per xbox follower,</font>

311
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">because, of course,
the key thing here</font>

312
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">on everyone's
mind is safety.</font>

313
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:42,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">?</font>

314
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:46,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes?</font>

315
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, is kenny home?</font>

316
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, kenny's out back
playing with his friends.</font>

317
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forward, men!</font>

318
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">That—no—
no, you gotta turn me.</font>

319
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:07,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the enemy.
Defensive puh-puh-positions!</font>

320
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill 'em, get out!</font>

321
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I seek audience with
the traitor lady mckormick.</font>

322
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let them pass.</font>

323
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:27,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The princess bids your fat
ass welcome to her kingdom</font>

324
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and suggests
you state your purpose.</font>

325
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't win this, guys.
Look around you.</font>

326
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lay down your weapons,
and you can come back</font>

327
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fight for xboxes with us
on black friday.</font>

328
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The princess says that if
you want to change your mind</font>

329
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and agree that playstations
are better, she'll consider it.</font>

330
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kenny, we all understand
wanting to play as the chick</font>

331
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">once in a while, okay?</font>

332
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are never going to
be a real princess.</font>

333
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:52,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?</font>

334
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The princess calls you
a ball-licking lesbian.</font>

335
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That doesn't even make sense.</font>

336
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stan,
this has gone too far.</font>

337
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are going to get hurt.</font>

338
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you started
is way out of control.</font>

339
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What I started?
How dare you!</font>

340
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All these people are going
to be gaming on xbox.</font>

341
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:11,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really want to just game
with craig</font>

342
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rest of your life?</font>

343
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I would rather game
with craig</font>

344
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">than spend one minute</font>

345
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">having to set up
an xbox live account.</font>

346
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will get our playstations
tomorrow,</font>

347
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you buttholes
will have nothing!</font>

348
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're outnumbered
ten to one,</font>

349
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's no time left.</font>

350
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will you win?</font>

351
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:32,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The gods will find us a way.</font>

352
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So then samwell tarly
sees the army approaching,</font>

353
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his wiener
is about this big.</font>

354
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows that
stannis baratheon's weiner</font>

355
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">is probably shriveled
from the cold</font>

356
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">samwell has to rally his men.
So what does he do?</font>

357
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Takes out his wiener...</font>

358
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he dangles it around</font>

359
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all his men to see.</font>

360
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah!</font>

361
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!</font>

362
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, you said pizzas
were coming.</font>

363
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, yeah.
They're on their way.</font>

364
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're still coming.
So samwell's wiener goes—</font>

365
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you said they were on
their way like three hours ago.</font>

366
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If I don't get pizza soon,
I'm going pass out.</font>

367
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't worry,
they're coming.</font>

368
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:09,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pizzas are on their way.
They're gonna be amazing.</font>

369
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, john snow finally faces
jaime lannister,</font>

370
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this guy's weiner is,
you know, huge, right?</font>

371
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's not going to be easy.
- Ehh!</font>

372
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">mr. Gates, I was hoping
I could talk to you</font>

373
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:24,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the fight tomorrow.
- Certainly.</font>

374
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, eric, right?</font>

375
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my lord wizard king,
actually.</font>

376
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having your leadership
has certainly been a help,</font>

377
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I hope that we're clear
that this is my army.</font>

378
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">There can only be
one person of royalty.</font>

379
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:37,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's kind of the ruse.</font>

380
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I certainly don't want to
step on your toes.</font>

381
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:40,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, I'm quite good</font>

382
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">at letting my ceos
do what they want.</font>

383
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:44,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your ceos?</font>

384
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's face it—
this is really just about</font>

385
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and me getting xboxes</font>

386
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rest are simply there
to help us...</font>

387
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get through those doors.</font>

388
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh—hmm.
What?</font>

389
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:55,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ha ha!</font>

390
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:57,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it feel?</font>

391
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now who's walking who
through the betrayal garden?</font>

392
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you stay
the out of my business?</font>

393
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you stay the
out of my yard?</font>

394
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:10,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ish, ish, ish, oh-ish!</font>

395
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi-sooooo!</font>

396
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:17,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was amazing sex.
I enjoyed it immensely.</font>

397
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you?</font>

398
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know,
microsoft has given kids</font>

399
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:27,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">who want xboxes on black friday
a lot of support.</font>

400
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems a shame that the fight
will be so one-sided.</font>

401
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:34,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eh.</font>

402
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Black friday's
about to happen,</font>

403
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's not even
going to be a fight.</font>

404
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bad for both of us.</font>

405
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:42,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be something you can
give to kids who want sonies</font>

406
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make the fight more even.</font>

409
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:54,887
