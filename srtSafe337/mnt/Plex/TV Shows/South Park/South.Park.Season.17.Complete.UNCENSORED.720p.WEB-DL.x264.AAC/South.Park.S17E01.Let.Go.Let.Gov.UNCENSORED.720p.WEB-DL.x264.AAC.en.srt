00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:44,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sick of that stupid bitch.</font>

2
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blabbing, prissy little skank!</font>

3
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do people talk on
the phone like that?</font>

4
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't even get a minute of peace</font>

5
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">before that bitch walks in holding
the cell phone out like this</font>

6
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">and talking on speakerphone.</font>

7
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:56,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody wants to hear your goddamn
conversations you little bitch,</font>

8
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not that important!</font>

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no dude,</font>

10
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you it was
the worst pain in my entire life.</font>

11
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:01,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many hours were you guys playing?</font>

12
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like six hours dude.</font>

13
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my friends were all like 'dude</font>

14
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:06,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman we need you to
keep playing defense.'</font>

15
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">urhggh!</font>

16
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:08,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were playing football?</font>

17
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah but I was like,
'I can't you guys,</font>

18
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:10,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I twisted my ankle'.</font>

19
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:12,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the end though
they really needed me to play</font>

20
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:13,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I played through the pain.</font>

21
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:13,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what I'm saying?</font>

22
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:14,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not what happened</font>

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">you totally started
crying and quit the game!</font>

24
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, this is a private conversation!</font>

25
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then take that shit off speakerphone!</font>

26
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that that same kid?</font>

27
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah it's that kid Kyle again.</font>

28
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a total boner.</font>

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always listening in
on my phone calls.</font>

30
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we have a choice?</font>

31
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:29,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop listening to
my conversation Kyle!</font>

32
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, the NSA?</font>

33
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:31,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lawrence, remember I was telling</font>

34
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:32,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">how the government listens to</font>

35
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone's phone calls
and reads all our emails?</font>

36
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah you said that.</font>

37
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad said the government
keeps a data base on everyone.</font>

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is that? Is that Toby?
- Yeah.</font>

39
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:41,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, Toby are you
over at Lawrence's?</font>

40
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah we're ditching school.</font>

41
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're what? What'd you say?</font>

42
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and Toby are ditching school.</font>

43
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:48,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you guys</font>

44
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">the government thinks
they can do whatever they want</font>

45
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we don't have
any privacy anymore.</font>

46
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just between you and me,</font>

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think everyone is too stupid to see</font>

48
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:55,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">what this is all leading to.</font>

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you guys read 1984?</font>

50
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:57,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.</font>

51
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:58,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I didn't read either</font>

52
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I saw the puppet show
version at Casa Bonita.</font>

53
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to do something about this.</font>

54
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to organize a rally.</font>

55
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'd be cool.</font>

56
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:05,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'd be what?</font>

57
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:05,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'd be cool.</font>

58
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know right,
a big rally to tell the government</font>

59
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stay out of our private lives!</font>

60
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna email everybody
and put it up on my blog pages.</font>

61
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seriously feel like
I'm being spied on right now.</font>

62
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure the government has
a file on me a mile long</font>

63
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's why this is so important,
you know?</font>

64
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on I'm gonna make a video blog</font>

65
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my 'Stop Listening
To Me' website.</font>

66
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wassup everybody it's me again
just kickin' it at my school.</font>

67
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:25,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gonna be a big rally</font>

68
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:27,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">to tell the government to stop
gathering information on us.</font>

69
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:28,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna tweet you all the details</font>

70
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">but keep it quiet
cuz it's top secret.</font>

71
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys gonna update your blogs too?</font>

72
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude I can't really hear you Lawrence</font>

73
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you outside or something?</font>

74
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:36,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said I got
your tweet of the address.</font>

75
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, put Toby back
on the phone you gotta start</font>

76
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">googling everyone
the directions to the rally site.</font>

77
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:41,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toby you there, bro?</font>

78
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:42,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm here bro.</font>

79
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro you gotta, um,
email Dex about the rally</font>

80
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see if he'll
bring petition forms.</font>

81
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:52,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please take your rally
conversation somewhere else?</font>

82
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh hell no you did not just
invade my privacy again.</font>

83
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the last straw Kyle!</font>

84
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody!</font>

85
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:00,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, hey!</font>

86
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know</font>

87
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">we might have an NSA agent
right here at our school.</font>

88
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the NSA?</font>

89
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know.</font>

90
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The government is watching
everything you do.</font>

91
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always watching.</font>

92
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say it's to keep us safe,</font>

93
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what price is safety, Kyle?</font>

94
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">The government watches
everything we do?</font>

95
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:31,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

96
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:35,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey government.</font>

97
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:37,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me.</font>

98
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters.</font>

99
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna say, wul,</font>

100
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:45,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">thanks for watchin' over me
and doing everything you do.</font>

101
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">And please watch

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my friends Stan and Kyle,</font>

00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Craig and Token.</font>

00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even ol' Eric Cartman.</font>

105
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he can be a meany sometimes,</font>

106
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">but please watch over him too.</font>

107
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">G'night government.</font>

108
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yeah!</font>

109
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:08,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thank you President Obama</font>

110
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">for making me feel
so safe and looked after.</font>

111
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it wouldn't
be too much trouble,</font>

112
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd really like to get
a puppy for Christmas this year.</font>

113
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Night, government!</font>

114
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude they have gone
too far this time!</font>

115
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no doubt
the government is tracking me.</font>

116
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have to
put off the rally.</font>

117
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're spying on you?</font>

118
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:27,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah it's right here.</font>

119
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to Amazon to see if
they had grand theft auto five</font>

120
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:30,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it says '</font>

121
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:33,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">you might also be interested
in the Blu-Ray for Star Trek.'</font>

122
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:35,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm totally interested in
the Blu-Bay for Star Trek.</font>

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did they know that unless</font>

124
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:38,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">the government is keeping tabs on me?</font>

125
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is war bro.</font>

126
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget the rally.</font>

127
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go hardcore.</font>

128
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like what?</font>

129
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. Listen,</font>

130
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get a job at the NSA</font>

131
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:46,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I'm going to put all
their secrets up on Twitter.</font>

132
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah don't do that.</font>

133
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">No dude,</font>

134
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters
disguised as an employee</font>

135
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:52,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna ... hang ...
hang on a second, Lawrence.</font>

136
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:58,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we have a nosey
Nancy in the room.</font>

137
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, my Twitter account
might already be compromised.</font>

138
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm going to infiltrate the NSA</font>

139
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get all
their secrets out to the public</font>

140
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I'm gonna need something
better than Twitter.</font>

141
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need that new thing
where you don't need to type.</font>

142
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:08,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they already something
better than Twitter?</font>

143
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't you seen
the Alec Baldwin commercial?</font>

144
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. What Alec Baldwin commercial?</font>

145
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, I'm Alec Baldwin.</font>

146
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I love social media.</font>

147
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sometimes I accidentally
tweet things that are homophobic.</font>

148
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that way,</font>

149
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:23,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just type that way.</font>

150
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I realized,</font>

151
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">it wasn't me that was homophobic.</font>

152
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my thumbs,</font>

153
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they needed to be gotten rid of.</font>

154
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:31,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dah!</font>

155
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dowwww!</font>

156
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:35,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then the problem was,</font>

157
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have thumbs,</font>

158
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:37,920

everything I have to say.</font>

160
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's okay</font>

161
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">because now there's a device</font>

162
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:47,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">that can actually take
the thoughts in your head,</font>

163
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:49,702

164
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called Shitter.</font>

166
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,473

167
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,855

240
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:21,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so I yelled 'hey
get off TV you midget!'</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and surveilling all those phone calls</font>

339
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">can take a lot of manpower.</font>

340

<font color="#FFFFFF">He liked the fitness center</font>

347
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:56,923

<font color="#FFFFFF">I agreed to go along.</font>

375
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:46,037

out there who think like you.</font>

387
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">People who think
their government doesn't have the right</font>

388

<font color="#FFFFFF">to go around poking their noses
in the emails of its citizens</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to know the truth?</font>

404
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth about what?</font>

405
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just goin'

00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:55,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh no, I don't think so.</font>

408
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:58,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes sir my colleague and I ...
we want to share our experience at DMV.</font>

409
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">We went to DMV and we admit to</font>

410
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">all our shortcoming and sins
and a big tidal wave of a peace and</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

413
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see Craig,
once I came clean with the government,</font>

414
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:11,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I no longer had anything to hide.</font>

415
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I found peace.

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you read this part out loud?</font>

420
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:28,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Your local DMV is funded by
your tax dollars to be efficient</font>

422
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

423
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think President
Obama means when he says that?</font>

424
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea.</font>

425
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we believe that</font>

426
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">he means the government loves you.
And it wants to forgive you</font>

427
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you just let
the government into your heart.</font>

431
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">they live forever because
government keep a file on us.</font>

432
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">So all that live forever up
in what they call the cloud.</font>

433
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:57,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the government, sir,
if they gonna put that file in the cloud</font>

434
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I wanna make sure I come

00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">get those things off
my record off the cloud.</font>

436
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we live forever,

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh huh.
Did you follow all that Craig?</font>

438
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really think
I followed all that.</font>

439
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done it.
I've infiltrated the NSA</font>

440
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gained their trust.</font>

441
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far I have not ascertained</font>

442
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:19,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">how they are able to keep track
of everyone in the country.</font>

443
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm close, very close.
I just hope that I'm not found out</font>

444
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a whistle blower before I'm able
to expose their entire operation.</font>

445
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is that voice?</font>

446
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some little faggot in my head.</font>

447
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey so um,

448
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:34,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">phone calls, um, how do I know
which people to start with?</font>

449
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty simple. Everyone has a file.</font>

we really want to look at.</font>

452
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more we pay attention to them,
the bigger their file becomes.</font>

453
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? How big is my file?</font>

454
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:50,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, that is-uh, you must have
a pretty big file on Eric Cartman.</font>

455
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:52,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">All his blogs and emails have
been watched for quite some time.</font>

we got on an Eric Cartman.</font>

457
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any files on Eric Cartman?</font>

458
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yeah,
we tracked him for a little bit</font>

459
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:02,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">but central computer designated
his status as fat and unimportant.</font>

460
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">uh trust me,
he's not fat and unimportant.</font>

461
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:08,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need to change his
status to ripped and sweet.</font>

00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:10,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

463
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, there is a very important
threat to national security.</font>

464
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:15,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to change Eric Cartman's status</font>

465
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's when I masturbated
to game of thrones.</font>

00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:21,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it was wrong to masturbate</font>

00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:24,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know it was especially
wrong to masturbate while on duty</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">what the ...</font>

469
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:26,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">why do these people keep coming here?</font>

470
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:29,957

How do you feel?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be,
then at the DMV with</font>

00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">all you wonderful people!
Now let's all pledge allegiance!</font>

479
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pledge allegiance</font>

This is the DMV!</font>

482
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be no joy here!</font>

483
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">uh, people keep showing up
and telling us what they did wrong.</font>

to renew my license.</font>

485
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much longer I gotta wait?</font>

486
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up!</font>

487
00:17:04,364 --> 00:17:06,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit there and wait and no
cel phones or other things</font>

00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:08,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">that pass time joyously!</font>

489
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna put a stop to this.</font>

490
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:16,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I am telling you
that you are making a huge mistake.</font>

491
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Cartman is
the NSA's worst nightmare.</font>

492
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not according to
the central computer.</font>

493
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">The central computer is wrong.</font>

494
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:23,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to change his status.</font>

495
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, but if central computer says</font>

496
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's not a threat then
we can't do anything.</font>

497
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't do anything? You're the NSA.</font>

498
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:32,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's 300 million people out there.</font>

499
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think we're able
to keep track of every single</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">person in this country?</font>

501
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think we're able to
really know who is doing what?</font>

502
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:38,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

503
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, I'll show you.
But this is very top security stuff.</font>

504
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if people knew how we did it,
then everyone would do it.</font>

505
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then our enemies would do it.</font>

506
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't let our enemies
get their hands on this.</font>

507
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get their hands on what?</font>

508
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how we know who's
a threat and who's not.</font>

509
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">How we know who is sleeping,
and who's awake.</font>

510
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">How we know ...</font>

511
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">you think I'm fat
and unimportant now?</font>

512
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:13,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Eric Cartman!
And I've got news for you.</font>

513
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all being broadcast
live on my Twitter zeppelin</font>

00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,144

you're doing to Santa you can</font>

519
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can kiss your problem goodbye.</font>

520
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have taken me
down when you had the chance.</font>

521
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now everyone knows the truth.</font>

522
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:35,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone's gonna
think I'm super cool.</font>

00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, honey, what's the matter?</font>

524
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't work, mom.</font>

525
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:48,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I infiltrated the NSA and I was
a whistleblower and I thought</font>

526
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone would be super pissed
off at what I exposed about the</font>

527
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">government, but nobody cares!
Nobody cares that the government</font>

528
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:57,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">is listening in on everything.
Nobody cares that Santa Claus</font>

529
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">hooked up to a big horrible machine!</font>

530
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:02,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that the NSA is torturing Santa,
sweetie,</font>

531
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they're keeping us safe.</font>

532
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:07,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, now you just sound
like everybody else!</font>

533
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:09,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, it's okay.</font>

534
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:10,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not going to be okay</font>

535
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">because now I'm a whistleblower
against my country</font>

536
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:14,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna have to
hide out in Russsiaaaaaa.</font>

537
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't have
to fly to Russia hon.</font>

538
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:21,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it'll be fine.</font>

539
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about I make you some hot
tea with lemon and codeine?</font>

540
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

541
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want hot tea and codeine, mom.</font>

542
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay hon!</font>

543
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:41,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. How would you
like to know the truth?</font>

544
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuck are you
talking about Butters?</font>

545
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:47,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to let go, Eric.</font>

546
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see there's no other way?</font>

547
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let the government
into your heart.</font>

548
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late for me, Butters.</font>

549
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go to Russia
and live with the commie dwarves.</font>

550
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never too late.
There's a place where you can start over.</font>

551
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's this?</font>

552
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your government doesn't listen
in on you to punish you.</font>

553
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:08,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your government just wants you
to be honest about your mistakes.</font>

554
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can be forgiven?</font>

555
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">For everything bad I've ever done.</font>

556
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">yes.</font>

557
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then all I have to do is go
back to this place every time</font>

558
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do something wrong and admit
it and I'm forgiven again?</font>

559
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

560
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty cool.</font>

561
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a new member today!</font>

562
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Cartman,
do you love your country?</font>

563
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:31,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do! I love my country!</font>

564
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you pledge allegiance to the fly?</font>

565
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pledge it!</font>

566
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:36,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fucking pledge that allegiance!</font>

567
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hallelujah!</font>

568
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want us to kick them out of here?</font>

569
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

570
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">No leave them alone.
It's a nice change to see people</font>

571
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">happy to be at the DMV.
Perhaps we here at the DMV can</font>

572
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">start changing as well.
Perhaps instead of treating</font>

573
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">people badly,
we can offer them comfort and hope.</font>

574
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:58,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, the DMV can be a place
where people come to get things</font>

575
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:01,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">off their chest, confess, yes,
but also be told that they're</font>

576
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">worth something in this world.
And then DMV's everywhere can</font>

577
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">become a place where
people feel safe.</font>

578
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:10,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they do something wrong,
we can offer forgiveness.</font>

579
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see what
this could lead to?</font>

580
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see what we could become?</font>

581
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:19,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">The DMV was shut down today
after rampant allegations of sex</font>

582
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">with young boys.
The heads of the DMV were arrested</font>

583
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the director said :
"Hey, it came with the territory."</font>

584
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the dvm shut down,
Americans are being asked to</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">confess wrong doings
at their nearest post office.</font>

586

allegations of sex with young boys.</font>

588
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,496
