141
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they did the usual

<font color="#FFFFFF">but we just need to send
a technician to your house</font>

154
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">to change out the cable box.</font>

155
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

156
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need a window
of time you can be home</font>

157
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:14,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">how about between 6:00 A.M.
to 3:00 P.M.</font>

158
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of November.</font>

159
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:21,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't wait around my house
from 6:00 am to 3pm all of November.</font>

160
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can't?
Jeez, that's too bad.</font>

161
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to be home
for the technician.</font>

162
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you go to Direct TV?</font>

163
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't afford Direct TV.</font>

164
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you can't?</font>

165
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez, that's terrible.</font>

166
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess have you to work
within our time windows.</font>

167
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, any luck?</font>

168
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, just the usual
cable company stuff.</font>

169
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, I guess we'll
have to live without</font>

170
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">our informative crime dramas.</font>

171
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw that.</font>

172
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we learn this Minecraft game</font>

173
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get around
our kid's parental lock.</font>

174
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried.</font>

175
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unlike other video games</font>

176
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it</font>

177
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's all retro like legos</font>

178
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">and kids online called me
a grifer and kicked me off.</font>

179
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can learn.</font>

180
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's talk of a child</font>

181
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he'll teach Minecraft to
anybody for the right price.</font>

182
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:24,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

183
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:25,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Cory Lanskin?</font>

184
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

185
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:31,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">We heard that you're willing
to teach Minecraft to adults?</font>

186
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off!</font>

187
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were told you're available
for hire and we're desperate.</font>

188
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:46,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are still wrong, misser.</font>

189
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a simple kit with a simple
passion for simple things.</font>

190
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have 100 ounces of silver.</font>

191
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:56,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wipe your feet and turn
off your cell phones.</font>

192
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we're going to
select an empty world.</font>

193
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:04,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selecting an empty world</font>

194
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">will begin you being
dropped onto a beach.</font>

195
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're free to roam around
and start punching trees.</font>

196
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punching trees?</font>

197
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would we punch trees?</font>

198
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just use your fucking brain.</font>

199
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you get wood?</font>

200
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you get wood?</font>

201
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watching informative murder porn?</font>

202
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:23,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, in the Minecraft forest
how do you get wood?</font>

203
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punching trees?</font>

204
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

205
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You punch the tree to get the wood.</font>

206
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the wood to build the cabin.</font>

207
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:31,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see.</font>

208
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:32,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">When does the game start?</font>

209
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:34,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are playing the game.</font>

210
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the game.</font>

211
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

212
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because your think like a dad.</font>

213
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minecraft don't have no winner.</font>

214
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">No objective</font>

215
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're just fucking building shit</font>

216
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seeing if other things
can come and knock it down.</font>

217
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's click on the inventory
and build a ****.</font>

218
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sir, I'm getting it now.</font>

219
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are?
- No!</font>

220
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, it's getting late.</font>

221
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just go to sleep.</font>

222
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:08,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost got it Sharon</font>

223
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:09,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found out where the horse is now</font>

224
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just have to figure
out how to tame one.</font>

225
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not in the mood now anyway.</font>

226
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss being intimate with you.</font>

227
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything was so passionate
and then it just dropped off.</font>

228
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like we're loosing our bond.</font>

229
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have to have sex for
our relationship to be good.</font>

230
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:26,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know but it's like
we're just good friends.</font>

231
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">A marriage has to be more than that.</font>

232
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has to have fulfillment of
fantasy and desire sometimes.</font>

233
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magnacube? What the hell is that?</font>

234
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to sleep.</font>

235
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wake you up if we get
our murder porn back.</font>

236
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:46,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

237
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Kyle,
the parental lock isn't working.</font>

238
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our parents are still
watching murder important.</font>

239
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

240
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:55,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I caught my parents watching it.</font>

241
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the cable company.</font>

242
00:10:57,848 --> 00:11:01,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true. I walked in on
my parents watching **** ****.</font>

243
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">They broke the parental lock somehow.</font>

244
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's impossible.</font>

245
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys sure
you set it up right?</font>

246
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:08,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?
Better get over here.</font>

247
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:10,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butter's dad killed his mom.</font>

248
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butter, what happened?</font>

249
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was out by the lake and I saw
my dad out in this field.</font>

250
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was holding sugar cane.</font>

251
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't make sense
because he had a hammer.</font>

252
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:27,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him take my mom</font>

253
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:30,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yelled watch out for the creepers</font>

254
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she fell.</font>

255
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. You mean in Minecraft?</font>

256
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:41,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, then my dad went berserk
and threw me down a well.</font>

257
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:44,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trapped down there all night.</font>

258
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad threw you down a well?</font>

259
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Minecraft.</font>

260
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

261
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was able to hoist myself out.</font>

262
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like I was frozen in the lake</font>

263
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had no idea how to swim out of it.</font>

264
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:59,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was terrible.</font>

265
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:00,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

266
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how our parents
broke the pass code.</font>

267
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought anyone
would stoop so low.</font>

268
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:06,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

269
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's teaching
our parents Minecraft.</font>

270
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello sir.
Had an incident last night.</font>

271
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonder if you saw or heard anything?</font>

272
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:21,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, what happened?</font>

273
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:24,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone broke into your next
door neighbor's backyard</font>

274
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">dug up a bunch of holes
and punched his trees.</font>

275
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punched his trees?</font>

276
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:33,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, across the street,
someone built a cabin.</font>

277
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird.</font>

278
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you doing last night?</font>

279
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:41,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just playing mine... my banjo.</font>

280
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I play the banjo too.</font>

281
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:45,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thanks for your time, sir.</font>

282
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may want to keep
the lights on in your yard tonight</font>

283
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">in case someone tries to
build a cabin on it as well.</font>

284
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will do, officer. Will do.</font>

285
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:55,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

286
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we're all concerned.</font>

287
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concerned?</font>

288
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to you and your stupid app</font>

289
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">parents are still
watching murder porn</font>

290
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now screwing up Minecraft too.</font>

291
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent three hours</font>

292
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to get my parents
to stop create my castle.</font>

293
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I finally got away from them,</font>

294
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found they were taking all my ****.</font>

295
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did we agree to the stupid app?</font>

296
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:18,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to keep our parents
from watching murder porn.</font>

297
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:19,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

298
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because one kid's dad killed his mom?</font>

299
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:26,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all we know they were
doing drugs for year.</font>

300
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe murder porn had
nothing to do with it.</font>

301
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree with Cartman.</font>

302
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we overreacted when...</font>

303
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,194

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true.</font>

305
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:41,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we need to trust our parents
won't act out what they see.</font>

306
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

307
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on out and there
won't be any trouble.</font>

308
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it up.</font>

309
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have nowhere to run.</font>

310
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

311
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never give up.</font>

312
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even remember doing this.</font>

313
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:00,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just leave me alone.</font>

314
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:02,894

<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to hell you grifer.</font>

317
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. We have to do something.</font>

318
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

319
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cory Lanskin?</font>

320
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

321
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:19,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">We heard you might be
teaching Minecraft to adults.</font>

322
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:25,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whassa Minecraft?</font>

323
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to keep our parents</font>

324
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">away from graphic television shows.</font>

325
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,909

327
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,484

328
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:35,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back in the meat locker.</font>

329
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouchie, ouchie!
Mommy rape my no-no.</font>

330
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">She loves me, right?</font>

331
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:40,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mommy loves me?</font>

332
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we have the wrong house, kid.</font>

333
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

334
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

335
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, dude?</font>

336
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:56,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something he said.</font>

337
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear him?</font>

338
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:01,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said ouchie,
ouchie mommy rape my no-no.</font>

339
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'd be caught lying</font>

340
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's exactly what
I would have said.</font>

341
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that you built a workbench</font>

342
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:13,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's time to build something to
take care of those fucking sheep.</font>

343
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,502

up brains and start...</font>

344
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:18,285

are enough grifers</font>

347
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the world without
our parents being shown this stuff.</font>

348
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">A kid needs to make a living,
don't he?</font>

349
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea what this is about,
do you?</font>

350
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were using Minecraft
to block our parents</font>

351
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">from watching spousal homicide shows.</font>

352
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,446
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like Investigative Discovery?</i></font>

353
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:35,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you know it?</font>

354
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have seen this stuff?</font>

355
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real sick shit.</font>

356
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents watch that stuff?</font>

357
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We put a stop to it
until you taught them Minecraft.</font>

358
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your problem ain't with me, mate.</font>

359
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, one or two people might act out what
they see in video games, but cable television?</font>

360
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">People copy everything
they see people do on cable.</font>

361
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got this all wrong.</font>

362
00:15:58,807 --> 00:15:59,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wants to protect your family,</font>

363
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll have to go fight
the cable company.</font>

364
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Can I help you?</font>

365
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:12,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

366
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are certain networks
we see as harmful to our families</font>

367
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we want them removed, please?</font>

368
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want cable any more?</font>

369
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, just I.D. Network,</font>

370
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">A&E, Oxygen and Oprah's network.</font>

371
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the ones with murder porn.</font>

372
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:27,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like paying
for all the channels?</font>

373
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our company actually
packages channels together.</font>

374
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you unpackage them
so we only get the channels we want?</font>

375
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:37,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry.
Our company doesn't work that way.</font>

376
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to give you the number</font>

377
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a different cable company... oh,</font>

378
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:42,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">wait, we're it, aren't we?</font>

379
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dang it.</font>

380
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess you have to deal
with our packages.</font>

381
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we talk to your supervisor,
please?</font>

382
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:50,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure.
Hey, David.</font>

383
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:52,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem here?</font>

384
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:57,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want specific networks
dropped from our cable.</font>

385
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to pay for the bundle</font>

386
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't just pay for what you watch.
Darn it!</font>

387
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean we're forced to
pay for the Oprah channel?</font>

388
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:09,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess if you don't want to be forced to pay for
Oprah you'd have to shut off your cable altogether.</font>

389
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, then we'll shut
off our cable altogether.</font>

390
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mitch, when can you get out
to shut off cable boxes?</font>

391
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.
It's gonna be like three weeks.</font>

392
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a whole plug
I have to pull out.</font>

393
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:22,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like four inches long.</font>

394
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:23,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three weeks, huh?</font>

395
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:26,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that okay with you guys?</font>

396
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's way too long.</font>

397
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, it is?
- Geez, that's terrible.</font>

398
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:35,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamnit I just don't want
my parents to murder each other.</font>

399
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you see we're just trying
to keep our families safe.</font>

400
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,466

couples murder each other</font>

make our parents do it</font>

402
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we probably can't
stop them from watching</font>

403
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:46,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">what they want to watch.</font>

404
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,532

make it more difficult</font>

405
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">because cable makes it so convenient.</font>

406
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:54,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they didn't have easy
access they'd be bummed out</font>

407

our responsibility to give them</font>

409
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, say the last part again?</font>

410
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

411
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was the last part you said?</font>

412
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said it's not our responsibility
to give them what they want.</font>

413
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:10,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">The part about your parents got
getting the channels easily.</font>

414
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said it would bum them out.</font>

415
