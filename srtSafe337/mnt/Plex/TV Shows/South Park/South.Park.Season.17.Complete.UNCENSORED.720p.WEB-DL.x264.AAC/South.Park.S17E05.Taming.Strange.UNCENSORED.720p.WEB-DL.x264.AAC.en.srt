happening to your body as well.</font>

that your testicles ache.</font>

150
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or if you're a girl,
you may notice</font>

151
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tingling sensation
in your strange.</font>

152

<font color="#FFFFFF">- This stupid, bro.
I already know all this.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's just give it
a chance, ike.</font>

154
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Going through canadian
puberty,</font>

155
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may notice that your voice
is starting to change as well.</font>

156
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying things like,
"hey, buddy," and, "hey, guy,"</font>

157
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because now that you're older,
you're discovering</font>

158
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">That someone who was once
your buddy is now your guy.</font>

159
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">And someone who
you used to call guy</font>

160
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is quickly becoming
your friend.</font>

161
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now let's discuss how a man
and woman make love.</font>

162
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, a man and a woman
fall in love.</font>

163
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the man farts
on the woman's strange...</font>

164
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filling the woman's
strange with air</font>

165
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the woman can queef
in the man's face,</font>

166
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the a is born.</font>

167
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">The entire process can take up
to six months—</font>

168
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what?</font>

169
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how babes are born?</font>

170
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's semen?</font>

171
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why did my wife queef
in my face?</font>

172
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said it was to—</font>

173
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why would sh—</font>

174
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to get to the bottom
of this.</font>

175
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me look like an idiot,
will you?</font>

176
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you told me you
queefed in my face</font>

177
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's how
babies are born.</font>

178
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was being sarcastic.
- Being sarcastic?</font>

179
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just told a million canadian
teenagers that's how it's done.</font>

180
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was angry because
you never listen to me</font>

181
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,411

with me to therapy,</font>

182
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you never go.
- Fine! You want to go</font>

183
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">With you to therapy?
Fine!</font>

184
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally.
Embarrassing and degrading.</font>

185
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">She queefed right in my face.
- Maybe you should spend</font>

186
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less time at work making
public health films</font>

187
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And more time at home.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">With your new job?
- What do you mean?</font>

292
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's more to this, terry.</font>

293
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lady never queefs
in her lover's face</font>

294
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without some major cause.</font>

295
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You started as the canadian
minister of health,</font>

296
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">And three months later,
your wife queefed in your face.</font>

297
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a connection.</font>

298
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I tried to make canada's
health care system better.</font>

299
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">What could that have to do
with your wife?</font>

300
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Terry, I'm your friend,
and I'm not just your friend.</font>

301
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also your buddy.
- Thanks, guy.</font>

302
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I'm telling you
there's more to this</font>

303
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you think, and if you want
to save your marriage</font>

304
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your face,
you need to figure it out quick.</font>

305
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey, so far the school
has spent</font>

306
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:32,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">$22,000 on
the intellilink system,</font>

307
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so far it's been
an unmitigated disaster.</font>

308
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but, see,
the problem is</font>

309
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everyone
is signed on to it yet.</font>

310
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They can't sign on,
because every time they try</font>

311
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">They make sprinklers go off.</font>

312
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know that intellilink has
had some... Hiccups, okay?</font>

313
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've hired a new faculty member</font>

314
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose sole responsibility</font>

315
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will be to oversee
the intellilink system</font>

316
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make sure it runs smoothly.</font>

317
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you all to meet
pat conners.</font>

318
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, everyone.
- Don't hello us, pat!</font>

319
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">This system you're responsible
for now isn't working out.</font>

320
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what the hell are you going
to do about it?</font>

321
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, well, I'm just sort of
getting acclimated</font>

322
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the situation, and—
- getting acclimated?</font>

323
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how much money
we wasted on this thing?</font>

324
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you take
some responsibility?</font>

325
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the hell out of here, pat.
You're fired, get out.</font>

326
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how the hell we going to
clean up pat's mess?</font>

327
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we got no choice,
mkay.</font>

328
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to upgrade to
the intellilink gold package.</font>

329
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, no.
- It's a $10,000 upgrade,</font>

330
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it should clean up
all of pat's mistakes.</font>

331
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey, let's be clear.
Intellilink was your idea.</font>

332
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should just admit
it was a bad one</font>

333
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">And stop being so defensive.</font>

334
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, it's good to be
a little defensive</font>

335
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Around you, miles, mkay?</font>

336
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not forget your wife
died of an "accident"</font>

337
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you were "drinking"
on a hike.</font>

338
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">"mkay"?</font>

339
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, now listen —
- no, you listen to me!</font>

340
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intellilink is a great idea,</font>

341
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we just need the goddamn
gold package.</font>

342
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doubling down.</font>

343
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're watching
e entertainment news.</font>

344
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">God knows why.</font>

345
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's all grown up,
and she wants you to know it.</font>

346
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">From kid show star

photographed smoking pot,</font>

349
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,995

a raunchy performance</font>

video music awards.</font>

the mtv performance</font>

352
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will be one for
the record books.</font>

353
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Foofa's got that nice
shaved strange</font>

354
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,606

it'd go over well.</font>

You won't listen to us,</font>

mixed that up,</font>

422
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:08,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your brother's been
receiving</font>

426
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,067

- That system</font>

428
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is totally screwed up and does
nothing but wreak havoc!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's fine! It works fine!
Just give it time!</font>

430

<font color="#FFFFFF">My... Wife.</font>

432
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,515

Don't you see, terry,</font>

433
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">That health care integration
system</font>

434
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has made you defensive
and hostile,</font>
