wanted to talk to you</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, goodness, I am so nervous.</font>

28
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Have a seat, Henrietta.</font>

29
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:29,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, a little family chitchat.

30
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I</font>

31
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:34,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">have been concerned about
your behavior for some time.</font>

32
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we really doing this again?</font>

33
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've had a hard time coping</font>

34
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the dark things you're into,</font>

35
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we've finally had some counseling.</font>

36
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently we're not the only parents</font>

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">who have a child that is "emo."</font>

38
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- But daddy and I love our little muffin,</font>

39
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if she's emo or not.</font>

40
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a fucking emo.</font>

41
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you even know the fucking diff?</font>

42
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how your foul language</font>

43
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">breaks your mother's heart?</font>

44
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like calling mommy "demon jizz."</font>

45
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, listen, sweetie, we've found a camp.</font>

46
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:02,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

47
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">A camp which is for troubled kids like you,</font>

48
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you get to work outside
and learn about responsibility.</font>

49
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to any fucking camp.</font>

50
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for two weeks and when you come back</font>

51
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can talk about earning
back some of your privileges.</font>

52
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:18,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't come back because
I'll be fucking dead</font>

53
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll walk out of that camp,
and I'll walk the streets</font>

54
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:23,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I probably get picked
up and gang-banged by criminals</font>

55
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes.</font>

56
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have a horseshoe pit</font>

57
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you can challenge the
other kids to horseshoes.</font>

58
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:34,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's all you know?</font>

59
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:35,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else did she say?</font>

60
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said that her parents called her an emo</font>

61
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:39,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she had to go to
this camp for two weeks.</font>

62
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:41,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, for two weeks?</font>

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is she at the camp now?
- I don't know.</font>

64
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">She texted from the bus they put her on</font>

65
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">then she said she wasn't even allowed</font>

66
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have her cell phone where she was going.</font>

67
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then all of a sudden, her texts went dark.</font>

68
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa.
- That's fucking creepy, man.</font>

69
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:54,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't believe it.</font>

70
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe parents
would do that to their child.</font>

71
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, now, you say that
you witnessed your friend</font>

72
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">being abused by her parents.</font>

73
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

74
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called her an emo.</font>

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's wrong with that?
- Emos suck.</font>

76
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're vile, self-pitying,
depressed assholes.</font>

77
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why do you think they called her that?</font>

78
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:16,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she's goth,</font>

79
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some ignorant people
don't know the difference.</font>

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the difference?</font>

81
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, they're totally different.</font>

82
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, different how?</font>

83
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're... you know, one is good,</font>

84
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">and... and emos are horrible.</font>

85
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're... you know, they're posers.</font>

86
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emos suck my goth balls.</font>

87
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, think of it this way.</font>

88
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:37,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">A goth believes that, deep down,
the world is totally fucked up.</font>

89
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">But an emo thinks that, deep down,</font>

90
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are totally fucked up.</font>

91
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not much of a difference.</font>

92
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a huge fucking difference.
- Okay, okay, look,</font>

93
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">emos are more prone to suicide.</font>

94
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">This fucking bitch, man.</font>

95
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">But goths are more prone to be depressed</font>

96
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">that so many people commit suicide.</font>

97
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goth's darkness is nihilistic,
whereas emo's is cynical.</font>

98
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:57,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I thought we were cynical.</font>

99
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wh... whatever, it doesn't matter.
- No, see, you're nihilistic.</font>

100
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:02,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, you're right.</font>

101
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello? Somebody let me out of here.</font>

102
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:14,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't treat people like this.</font>

103
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is fucking ridiculous!
What's wrong with you?</font>

104
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:23,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go to the fucking
cops when I get out of here.</font>

105
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if she comes back</font>

106
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's all preppy and conformist?</font>

107
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's only been there two weeks.</font>

108
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't have changed her that much.</font>

109
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can they have?</font>

110
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

111
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

112
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell have they done to you?</font>

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean? They
couldn't do anything.</font>

114
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:09,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't fix me.</font>

115
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:11,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't even understand me.</font>

116
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, it's worse than we thought.</font>

117
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">They made her emo!</font>

118
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has she said one word to
either one of you guys?</font>

119
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:33,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

120
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like she's a totally different person.</font>

121
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't even look at us.</font>

122
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">All she does now is hang out with the</font>

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">douchebag emo kids.</font>

124
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:44,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, P.E. class is for such wannabe posers.</font>

125
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather kill myself
than put on gym shorts.</font>

126
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:49,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish there'd just be an earthquake</font>

127
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we could all die.</font>

128
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, how can she hang out with them?</font>

129
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be something else going on here.</font>

130
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:03,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, mom! I'm suicidal.</font>

131
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your mom, it's me.</font>

132
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey.</font>

133
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did they do to you at that camp?</font>

134
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

135
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:14,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the usual group therapy crap.</font>

136
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take this the wrong way,</font>

137
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think that place
turned you into an emo.</font>

138
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:23,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous. I'm not anything.</font>

139
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?</font>

140
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you listening
to Sunny Day Real Estate?</font>

141
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:31,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking,</font>

142
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe they just made you
confused at that place.</font>

143
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they didn't know
what they were doing.</font>

144
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I started thinking...</font>

145
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe that place turned you emo on purpose.</font>

146
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, maybe they knew what they were doing.</font>

147
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should probably
stop digging for answers.</font>

148
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

149
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no winning this for you.</font>

150
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon, the entire world will be emo.</font>

151
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is our time.</font>

152
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:05,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

153
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody understands us.</font>

154
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they won't understand
until it is far too late.</font>

155
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, no way!</font>

156
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not fight it, Michael.</font>

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is being emo really all that
different from being goth?</font>

158
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Join us.</font>

159
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way!</font>

160
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:26,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way, no way!</font>

161
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death and despair!</font>

162
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death and despair!</font>

163
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death and despair!</font>

164
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:33,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death and desp...</font>

165
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

166
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worse than we thought.</font>

167
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is, everything?</font>

168
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean Henrietta. I confronted her,</font>

169
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:43,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she was all like, "I am emo,</font>

170
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and emos are going to rule the world."</font>

171
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was like, no way!</font>

172
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she was like, "yeah,
soon it will be too late."</font>

173
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was all, no way! No way.</font>

174
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so listen, call up Firkle,</font>

175
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:53,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">and meet me at Village Inn.</font>

176
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got to run home, but
I'll be there in ten minutes.</font>

177
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michael? Michael!</font>

178
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't now, mom, I've got an emergency.</font>

179
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the dining room, Michael. Let's go.</font>

180
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a seat, son.</font>

181
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom and I have decided</font>

182
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're going to go away for a little while.</font>

183
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:12,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

184
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:14,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been put in touch with this camp</font>

185
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">for troubled kids like you and...</font>

186
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:17,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you talking about?</font>

187
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place gonna fix you,
make you normal child!</font>

188
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you gotta listen to me!</font>

189
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what you're doing!</font>

190
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucking conformists!</font>

191
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're evil!</font>

192
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought it would end like this.</font>

193
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought that goths would just be</font>

194
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">slowly replaced by emos.</font>

195
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pete... if they get me,</font>

196
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:50,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I get sent to that
camp and I come back emo,</font>

197
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">kill me.</font>

198
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:53,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise that you'll kill me.</font>

199
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

200
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you kids need to order
something or you need to go.</font>

201
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, lady, we're really depressed.</font>

202
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So what else is new?
- This is different, okay!</font>

203
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our two friends are being
body-snatched by emos!</font>

204
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:08,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one other group
who understands emos like we do.</font>

205
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have to team
up with the vampires.</font>

206
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you crazy?
- What choice do we have?</font>

207
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vampires are our sworn enemies.</font>

208
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We beat up their leader
and burned down their lair.</font>

209
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:22,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't you remember?
- Yeah, I remember.</font>

210
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it may be a suicide mission,</font>

211
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:26,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we have to walk right
into the middle of the vampires</font>

212
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ask them for help.</font>

213
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's all be seated, please.</font>

214
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the noon meeting of the vamp kids.</font>

215
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Mike, your lord
and dark master, per se.</font>

216
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail Mike.</font>

217
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, our main order of
business is, of course,</font>

218
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Halloween social.</font>

219
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still looking for
volunteers to make the...</font>

220
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the goth kids!</font>

221
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, you spit on me, Larry.</font>

222
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, hey, everybody.</font>

223
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I know we aren't on the
greatest terms right now.</font>

224
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">We realize we called you all queermos</font>

225
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're sorry we burned
down the hot topic at the mall.</font>

226
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, uh, we've got a bigger problem here,</font>

228
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's all of our problem.</font>

229
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a lot of nerve coming here.</font>

230
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, shut up, Mike. Listen, okay?</font>

231
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a camp that kids
like us are being sent to,</font>

232
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">and somehow this place
is taking kids like us</font>

233
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">and turning them emo.</font>

234
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

235
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might not even be
able to tell at first.</font>

236
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could've already happened.</font>

237
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of you might already be turned.</font>

238
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, hold up. Hold up!</font>

239
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean that one of us might
not really be a vamp kid?</font>

240
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, right.</font>

241
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:48,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whoever you is,</font>

242
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">you better get your ass
ready to run, motherfucker,</font>

243
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause you a damn traitor.</font>

244
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll bet you it's this
little nigga right here.</font>

245
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you guys gonna go to
the fall out boy concert?</font>

246
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, I'm too depressed.
I keep cutting myself.</font>

247
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm cutting myself</font>

248
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hurt this worthless body that I'm in.</font>

249
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Henrietta,</font>

250
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:15,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I baked cookies for your
new little emo friends.</font>

251
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?</font>

252
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment!</font>

253
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm not the pretty
cheerleader you always wanted!</font>

254
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she still seem better?</font>

255
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, much better.</font>

256
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't call me a bitch,</font>

257
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she actually apologized to me!</font>

258
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's more like it.</font>

259
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what we should do</font>

260
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">after us emos take over the earth?</font>

261
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should, um, paint the white house black,</font>

262
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we should have fall out
boy play at the super bowl.</font>

263
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're emos.</font>

264
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:46,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we rule the earth,
we're not gonna have football.</font>

265
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:47,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

266
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you say she just showed up like this?</font>

267
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Henrietta.</font>

268
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">That thing in there is not Henrietta.</font>

269
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">That blonde emo in there is Sarah Collins.</font>

270
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a vamp kid two weeks ago!</font>

271
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to go in there
and waste these motherfuckers?</font>

272
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do it.</font>

273
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just go in there
and kick their asses.</font>

274
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to stop this thing at its source.</font>

275
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed.</font>

276
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there is some kind
of black magic at work,</font>

277
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">creating these monsters,
then we will have to</font>

278
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">use our most powerful
vampiric abilities to stop it.</font>

279
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you mean...
- Yes, my child of darkness.</font>

280
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must call upon the powers</font>

281
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:20,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the vamp kids' most
sacred entity, per se.</font>

282
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:24,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only he can help us in this darkest time.</font>

283
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:26,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">This calls for a summoning.</font>

284
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call upon the creator
of all that is dark,</font>

285
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">the godfather of death and despair,</font>

286
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:40,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edgar Allan Poe,</font>

287
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">your followers in
darkness beg for your help.</font>

288
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">We summon to the world of the living</font>

289
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">the great Edgar Allan Poe,</font>

290

special guidance, per se.</font>

292
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your plan?</font>

293
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to summon Edgar Allan
Poe back from the dead?</font>

294

<font color="#FFFFFF">Edgar Allan Poe was the original vamp kid.</font>

295
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:01,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he was the original goth,</font>

296
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's been dead for 150 years.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">all genres of gothic subcultures
are derivative of Poe's work...</font>

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all you've done since
then is waste our time.</font>

302
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit, look!</font>

303
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I? What is this place?</font>

304
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.</font>

305
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why have the living
summoned me from my rest?</font>

306
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, okay, okay, listen,</font>

307
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:32,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's this camp for troubled kids, right?</font>

308
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:33,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only they aren't helping kids,</font>

309
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're purposely turning them into emos.</font>

310
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emos?</font>

311
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew, my God, emos are
such wannabe conformists.</font>

312
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, oh, yes.
- Right?</font>

313
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children of darkness,</font>

314
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would help you, but
I fear I cannot be seen</font>

315
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a bunch of douchey vamp kids</font>

316
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their poser-ass plastic fangs.</font>

317
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you!
- Hey!</font>

318
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying it's nice to know</font>

319
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Edgar Allan Poe agrees with us.</font>

320
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agrees with who?</font>

321
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that red dye in your hair</font>

322
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">or did a blood demon take
a shit on your head, poser?</font>

323
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhoh, he got you there, nigga.</font>

324
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look, we're running out of time.</font>

325
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to help us stop the emos.</font>

326
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I?</font>

327
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:09,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 'cause you summoned me</font>

328
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't mean you're the boss of me.</font>

329
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, it kind of does.</font>

330
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay, mom.</font>

331
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go fight the emos, mom.</font>

332
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... where you ta...</font>

333
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

334
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:28,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

335
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

336
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me out of here!</font>

337
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go!</font>

338
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's best you don't upset them.</font>

339
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing to people?</font>

340
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:45,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me. I just work for them.</font>

341
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not evil, you know.</font>

342
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just misunderstood.</font>

343
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I do is help the emos
get into their human host.</font>

344
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">They promised me, when
they take over earth,</font>

345
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can have a cabin on the lake
and all the steak I can eat.</font>

346
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. Emos are plants?</font>

347
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh, shh, it's okay.</font>

348
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just any plant. They're very unique.</font>

349
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very special!</font>

350
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody understands them.</font>

351
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emo-claris americanus.</font>

352
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful species,</font>

353
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">except for their tendencies
of self-mutilation</font>

354
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the need for other species
to acknowledge their pain.</font>

355
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it all makes sense now.</font>

356
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry! Sorry, emo king!</font>

357
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I wasn't talking to him.</font>

358
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I was, but... Yes.</font>

359
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I understand.</font>

360
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right away.</font>

361
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! What are you doing?</font>

362
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be emo!</font>

363
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just don't understand.</font>

364
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll understand them soon.</font>

365
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...</font>

366
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quicker if you don't fight it.</font>

367
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Nooo!</font>

368
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:50,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, listen up.</font>

369
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:51,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once we find our friend,</font>

370
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">we gotta torch the place and get out.</font>

371
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?</font>

372
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell me what to do.</font>

373
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who elected you the mayor of me?</font>

374
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:02,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it out, Edgar. It's annoying everybody.</font>

375
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, you guys are so lame.</font>

376
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:05,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you want my help,</font>

377
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">you better all stop calling me Edgar.</font>

378
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's your name, isn't it?</font>

379
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the name my stupid parents gave me.</font>

380
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to be called by my goth name,</font>

381
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nightpain.</font>

382
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:15,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

383
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You guys are posers!</font>

384
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, just so you all know,</font>

385
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">if one of you ain't who they say they is,</font>

386
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:23,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we get inside that base and you reveal</font>

387
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:25,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">you actually one of them emo
motherfuckers in disguise,</font>

388
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will go crazy on your ass.</font>

389
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">If one of us is a traitor,</font>

390
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.</font>

391
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck off, Nightpain.</font>

392
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me, poser.</font>

393
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michael? You here?</font>

394
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like we're being watched.</font>

395
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, Michael, are you okay?</font>

396
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick it over. Stop the plant!</font>

397
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh, thank God you're here.</font>

398
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emos are plants,</font>

399
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're invading human bodies.</font>

400
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we're gonna get you out of here,</font>

401
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we're gonna burn
this whole place down.</font>

402
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:27,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,</font>

403
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:30,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm afraid that's not the plan.</font>

404
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did very good.</font>

405
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:35,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">The emo plants are pleased
with your dedication.</font>

406
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:38,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Firkle, all this time
we thought you were goth.</font>

407
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you been emo?</font>

408
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see we can't stop them?</font>

409
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might as well join 'em.</font>

410
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:53,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, emo king, right away.</font>

411
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">The emo king wants us to proceed at once.</font>

412
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, let us go, you ultimate conformists!</font>

413
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fight it. It's quicker that way.</font>

414
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I'm starting to feel emo.</font>

415
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute, where the
hell is Edgar Allan Poe?</font>

416
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was over this</font>

417
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:10,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.</font>

418
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:11,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

419
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:17,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, are you gonna order any food</font>

420
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">or are you just gonna sit
there and drink coffee all day?</font>

421
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone. I just want coffee.</font>

422
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:25,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Little prick.
- Bitch.</font>

423
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:26,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poe?</font>

424
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?</font>

425
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing?</font>

426
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to be helping us.</font>

427
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:32,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't right now.</font>

428
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dealing with a lot, and
I just have a lot of anxiety.</font>

429
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:38,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we summoned you to
help us save the world.</font>

430
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the point?</font>

431
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save some people so some
other people can be lame?</font>

432
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:44,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then those lame-os can
be lame to some other posers?</font>

433
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, he is such a downer.</font>

434
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let the spores inside you.</font>

435
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop fighting it.</font>

436
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, look!</font>

437
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm here, posers.</font>

438
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:59,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nightpain! Destroy the plant leader!</font>

439
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">The leader, over there!</font>

440
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to do?</font>

441
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:04,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot it!</font>

442
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Shoot a plant?</font>

443
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:08,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot it!</font>

444
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

445
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

446
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">This says it was bought</font>

447
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">at Lowes Home and Garden for $29.95.</font>

448
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lowes Home and Garden?</font>

449
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, these are just plants.</font>

450
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they... they talk to me.</font>

451
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:30,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they're just, like, ficus
plants in vibrating pots.</font>

452
