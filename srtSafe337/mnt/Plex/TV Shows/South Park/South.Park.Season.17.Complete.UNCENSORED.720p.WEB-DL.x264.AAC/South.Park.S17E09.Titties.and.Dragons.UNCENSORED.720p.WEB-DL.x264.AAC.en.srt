00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:28,589

by that traitor whore Kenny!</font>

7
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems a shame that the
fight will be so one-sided.</font>

8
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:33,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go seek out George R.R. Martin for answers.</font>

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

33
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:42,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny is here to report</font>

34
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:44,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">She came!</font>

35
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is cute, isnt she.</font>

36
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes</font>

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was fast.
Thank you Princess Kenny</font>

38
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:57,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a problem. Xbox... next week...
Microsoft is holding my shipment!</font>

39
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:00,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, Princess Kenny to the rescue!</font>

40
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Idiot. This is a big...</font>

41
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:13,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it is princess Kenny!</font>

42
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, Princess Kenny is here.</font>

43
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did what?</font>

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">He flew down in a parachute and he what?</font>

45
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, he stopped Microsoft</font>

46
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">from blockading the
shipment of PS4s to the mall.</font>

47
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:28,724

48
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">winning the console wars for Sony.</font>

49
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:32,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because what... because he's cute?</font>

50
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side.</font>

51
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't stop him.</font>

52
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what does he do besides that he's cute?</font>

53
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, Bill Gates is
on the phone for you.</font>

54
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, mom!</font>

55
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:43,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom?</font>

56
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't seriously tell
Bill Gates to suck my ass.</font>

57
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him everything's cool and
I'll call him in a little bit.</font>

58
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would have never
happened if you would have</font>

59
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">let Kenny be a princess in the first place.</font>

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a princess. He's a dude.</font>

61
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, unfortunately for us,
he's now on the other side.</font>

62
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're out of options.</font>

63
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:02,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So what are you saying, Kyle?
- I have an idea.</font>

64
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like it, but I think
it's the only choice we have.</font>

65
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here,</font>

66
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as you can see behind me,</font>

67
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">holiday shoppers are really getting antsy.</font>

68
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">People have been waiting out here</font>

69
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">since midnight on Thanksgiving.</font>

70
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're cold, they're starving,</font>

71
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's already been a lot of bloodshed</font>

72
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:30,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">over these holiday deals.</font>

73
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joining me now is Rick Tellmore</font>

74
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's been out here for six days,</font>

75
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your five-year-old son
was eaten, is that correct?</font>

76
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, that's right. We had to eat him.</font>

77
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all sort of starving out here,</font>

78
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we drew straws, and
he drew the shortest one.</font>

79
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you're hoping to get</font>

80
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Black Friday does finally start?</font>

81
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blu-ray player.</font>

82
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">96% off. It's gonna be about 20 bucks.</font>

83
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:52,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, some people might say</font>

84
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">that eating your child
is not very Christmassy.</font>

85
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you say to them?</font>

86
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:00,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

87
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ate my son for a blu-ray player ♪</font>

88

a jingle jingle jingle ♪</font>

89
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,370

00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doubt Christmas is alive and well</font>

92
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the South Park mall. Back to you, Tom.</font>

93
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:15,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ ho ho... ♪</font>

94
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys, here's the deal.</font>

95
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">The main entrance to the
mall is already blocked</font>

96
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">by thousands of waiting shoppers</font>

97
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:22,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">the kids who want Xboxes plan
to flank from the left here.</font>

98
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:24,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our best chance of being first inside</font>

99
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:27,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">is finding a way to the
mall's back entrance... here.</font>

100
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:28,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">At Red Robin.</font>

101
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:30,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Red Robin
has doors on the inside</font>

102
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">that go right out into the mall.</font>

103
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key to us being the first ones inside</font>

104
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:36,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">is taking over the Red Robin
before Black Friday starts.</font>

105
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how do we take over Red Robin?</font>

106
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea.</font>

107
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, excuse me.</font>

108
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes?
- The Xbox fighters are here,</font>

109
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:45,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they say they want to switch sides.</font>

110
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:46,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

111
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.</font>

112
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:53,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

113
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:56,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">On behalf of the Xbox fighters of
Zaron, we hereby lay down our arms.</font>

114
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:57,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">We give up, okay?</font>

115
00:04:58,218 --> 00:04:59,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ha ha.
- Shut up, Craig.</font>

116
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:01,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is very difficult!
You guys win, all right?</font>

117
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll all play on PlayStation 4s.</font>

118
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still think the Xbox
is a superior machine,</font>

119
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you guys got too
many people on your side,</font>

120
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.</font>

121
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody saw that coming.</font>

122
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:12,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the truth is</font>

123
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">we all have a bigger
problem now, and you know it.</font>

124
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's going to get anything
if we don't work together</font>

125
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">against those thousands of other shoppers.</font>

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">So better a PS4 than nothing... is that it?</font>

127
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:22,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we'll take our chances on our own.</font>

128
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know a way inside the Red Robin.</font>

129
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think you're the
only ones who thought of it.</font>

130
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were going to use the
Red Robin entrance too,</font>

131
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we figured out how.</font>

132
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red Robin can be rented out</font>

133
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">for wedding parties.</font>

134
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we all chip in, we
can pay for the deposit</font>

135
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have a wedding party there.</font>

136
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that could work.</font>

137
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this together, dude.</font>

138
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our only shot</font>

139
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">at playing any next gen
console's by teaming up.</font>

140
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you win a game on a PS4,</font>

141
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I do too.</font>

142
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you swear you'll be okay with that?</font>

143
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:51,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't ever talk about
the Xbox being better again?</font>

144
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear, Stan.</font>

145
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys, looks like
we've got a wedding to plan.</font>

146
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:09,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Console war is not yet over.</font>

147
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right</font>

148
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xbox and Sony PS4 are neck and neck</font>

149
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone relax.
Princess Kenny will do her best.</font>

150
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kenny-chan. Sorry for intruding but
an wedding invitation has come.</font>

151
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wedding?</font>

152
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kenny Kun, please come home at once.</font>

153
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our two houses have found peace.</font>

154
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come to the Red Robin wedding,</font>

155
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:37,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we will all accept you
as the princess you are.</font>

156
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours truly, the wizard king.</font>

157
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that is great.</font>

158
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny is going to an wedding.</font>

159
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for everything Princess Kenny</font>

160
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:53,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take care Kenny Chan!</font>

161
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny... Goodbye!</font>

162
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye everyone</font>

163
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny will now return to her friends.</font>

164
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could this be.</font>

165
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed Princess Kenny!</font>

166
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true.
Princess Kenny has died.</font>

167
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:21,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

168
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny is alright.</font>

169
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">How cute!</font>

170
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Stan, I was hoping I could
talk to you about the wedding.</font>

171
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sure, what about it?</font>

172
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:36,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's best that when the time comes</font>

173
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the mall to open you should
stay back a bit from the doors.</font>

174
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Well, think about it.</font>

175
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:42,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first people inside
are gonna have to take on</font>

176
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">the brunt of the holiday
shoppers from the main entrance.</font>

177
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's best we let butters
and Scott Malkinson go first.</font>

178
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:49,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">While they fight, we can simply slip on by.</font>

179
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah, I guess that makes sense,</font>

180
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:54,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">but butters and Scott won't
be able to get their PS4s.</font>

181
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that's true, but...</font>

182
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's face it, sir Stan.</font>

183
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all about you and
me getting PlayStations.</font>

184
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest are simply there to help us get...</font>

185
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:03,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying to you!</font>

186
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just acting like they've given up,</font>

187
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's a double-bluff.</font>

188
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude! Dude!</font>

189
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to betray you
at the Red Robin wedding.</font>

190
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got the idea watching Game of Thrones.</font>

191
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, shut the fuck up!</font>

192
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

193
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just this old crazy guy</font>

194
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:20,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">that gets pissed off 'cause
I'm in his garden all the time.</font>

195
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to lock you in!</font>

196
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:23,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it, shut up!</font>

197
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">He talked about it in my garden to, like,</font>

198
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">three other people.</font>

199
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to lock you in the Red Robin</font>

200
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then go get all the Xboxes.</font>

201
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:32,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why he wants you to
stay back from the doors.</font>

202
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't you just tell
the whole world everything?</font>

203
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you tell everyone
what Prometheus was about</font>

204
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you're at it!</font>

205
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Kyle know about this?</font>

206
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, we're not gonna
betray you... Come on.</font>

207
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see Prometheus?</font>

208
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:44,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think the writers
even knew what that was about.</font>

209
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Kyle know about this?</font>

210
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle thought of it.</font>

211
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan! Dude, hold on.</font>

212
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xbox one is fucking sweet, dude.</font>

213
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fucking asshole! Fuck you!</font>

214
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of my garden.</font>

215
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll shit in your fucking garden!</font>

216
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go fuck yourself!</font>

217
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:08,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the wait is over, and
Black Friday's finally here.</font>

218
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Niles Lawton is at the scene,</font>

219
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's about time, Niles.</font>

220
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Tom. Mall officials have said</font>

221
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are ready, and doors will open</font>

222
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">as soon as their guest of honor</font>

223
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.</font>

224
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">This year's ribbon cutter is,
of course, George R.R. Martin,</font>

225
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">who, doesn't appear to have shown up yet</font>

226
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">but says he is on his way.</font>

227
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like the dragons
and zombies in his novels,</font>

228
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">he is on his way.</font>

229
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, just hold on a minute!</font>

230
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:39,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty darn sure</font>

231
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:42,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fastest way back to
Colorado isn't on horseback.</font>

232
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:44,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may be true, but
horses have one quality</font>

233
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is unmatched by any
other mode of transition.</font>

234
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

235
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, cool, can we set up
the two lawn tables here</font>

236
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">like facing each other and then another</font>

237
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the bride and groom back there?</font>

238
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a rumor. May I ask...</font>

239
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is it that's getting married?</font>

240
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:08,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Hanks and Beyonce.</font>

241
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real? It's for real?</font>

242
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, I love them.</font>

243
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

244
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Beyonce's not with Jay Z anymore?</font>

245
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, clearly she wouldn't
be marrying Tom Hanks</font>

246
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">at Red Robin if she was.</font>

247
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, guys, not those tables.</font>

248
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?</font>

249
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone heard from
Butters and Scott Malkinson?</font>

250
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:24,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The fuck are they?
- Cartman, Cartman!</font>

251
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard that Stan somehow
found out about our plan.</font>

252
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he did.</font>

253
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what the hell are you doing?</font>

254
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This isn't gonna work now!
- Shh, shh, shh.</font>

255
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:33,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine, Kyle.</font>

256
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's been taken care of.</font>

257
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan won't be telling
anybody anything ever again.</font>

258
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell did you do?</font>

259
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">What had to be done</font>

260
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that we can play our
games on Xboxes, Kyle!</font>

261
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Tell me you didn't.</font>

262
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not allowed to come out of his room,</font>

263
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:51,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you can talk to him through the door.</font>

264
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:52,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
- And keep it short.</font>

265
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in real trouble.</font>

266
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">He defecated in a nice old man's garden.</font>

267
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">O... okay.</font>

268
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan?</font>

269
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan? Hello?</font>

270
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:10,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that?</font>

271
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, it's me.</font>

272
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here.</font>

273
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:16,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now.</font>

274
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:17,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta understand that I did it</font>

275
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:18,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I know in my heart</font>

276
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:21,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Xbox is better for all of us.</font>

277
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You completely betrayed</font>

278
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">the last bit of friendship we still had.</font>

279
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't playing fair, dude.</font>

280
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting your dad to work
part-time in the mall wasn't fair.</font>

281
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even know he was
working at the mall, Kyle.</font>

282
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:34,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't?</font>

283
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you couldn't just ask me,</font>

284
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Xbox people</font>

285
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:40,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't care about the truth.</font>

286
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:44,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just care about seamless
multimedia connectivity.</font>

287
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry.</font>

288
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole war has just
got us so screwed up...</font>

289
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want us to be playing Call of Duty</font>

290
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the right machine.</font>

291
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:54,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand.</font>

292
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm never playing Call
of Duty with you again.</font>

293
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, don't say that.</font>

294
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:02,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here. I'm done with you.</font>

295
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:04,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom! Mom!</font>

296
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:06,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him out of here!</font>

297
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him out!</font>

298
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:12,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now listen up.</font>

299
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are only eight of us now.</font>

300
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:17,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peterson was a great guy,</font>

301
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:20,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he did not deserve
to get beheaded like that.</font>

302
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know about you,</font>

303
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm sick and tired</font>

304
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">of getting to know people here,</font>

305
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting invested in their personalities</font>

306
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:31,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their back stories,
and then having them die.</font>

307
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">When those doors open,</font>

308
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">we all stick together.</font>

309
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk.</font>

310
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay tough, rookie.</font>

311
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna make it, sir.</font>

312
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna make it!</font>

313
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a newborn little girl</font>

314
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">who needs her daddy to make it.</font>

315
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to let you die, okay?</font>

316
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay?</font>

317
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:52,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir! Yes, sir.</font>

318
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not one more good person dies on my watch.</font>

319
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, they're
coming in through the roof!</font>

320
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:04,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this. I'm
sorry, I can't do this!</font>

321
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay at your post!</font>

322
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

323
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody really liked him!</font>

324
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

325
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go, Tom.</font>

326
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">George R.R. Martin has finally arrived</font>

327
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">to cut the red ribbon.</font>

328
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor</font>

329
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:30,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be here this morning</font>

330
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">on behalf of South Park mall partners</font>

331
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Channel 9 News,</font>

332
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">your go-to source for
news, weather, and sports.</font>

333
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do it!</font>

334
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:41,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

335
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the tradition of our ancestors,</font>

336
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:47,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's ring in the holidays!</font>

337
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:53,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first I'd like to share with you</font>

338
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">a few words about my wiener.</font>

339
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sorry, guys, Red Robin is closed</font>

340
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:03,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a special event today.</font>

341
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.</font>

342
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great. Go right on in.</font>

343
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, everyone, a Black Friday toast.</font>

344
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">How awesome that we are all friends again.</font>

345
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:27,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our two houses brought together.</font>

346
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.</font>

347
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:35,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny.</font>

348
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:36,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really look stunning.</font>

349
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doubt the gods have smiled
down upon your perky boobs.</font>

350
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if you'll excuse me, my lady,</font>

351
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:45,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to take a shit.</font>

352
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you found out?
The mall isn't open yet.</font>

353
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're waiting for George R.
R. Martin to cut the ribbon.</font>

354
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. That could be a while.</font>

355
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">All our men are ready.</font>

356
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the mall opens, blow the whistle.</font>

357
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll rush through the doors</font>

358
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lock the Sony dorks inside.</font>

359
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, now, I really
do need to take a shit.</font>

360
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, soft and pink with purple head,</font>

361
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">gently, you lay with me on my bed.</font>

362
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on with it, George R.R. Martin!</font>

363
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:17,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Growl, growl calls the wiener from on high,</font>

364
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little tiny wiener still
so pleasing to the eye.</font>

365
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough with the wieners already!</font>

366
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:23,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, come on!</font>

367
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clyde?</font>

368
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?</font>

369
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Kenny, I believe it's time</font>

370
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">we return the wizard's hospitality.</font>

371
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

372
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:44,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Cartman.</font>

373
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:46,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been a little change in plan.</font>

374
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, Kyle, they're about to open the mall.</font>

375
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:53,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

376
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am no longer an Xbox guy.</font>

377
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let my friend get grounded.</font>

378
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">But today I will get him a PlayStation.</font>

379
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, the PlayStation controller
sucks, and you know it!</font>

380
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fight is over, Cartman.</font>

381
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:04,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not over.</font>

382
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:07,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like I came just in time.</font>

383
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Bill Gates, sweet!</font>

384
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your face, Kyle!</font>

385
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:13,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not interfere, Bill Gates!</font>

386
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">These children will get their PS4s.</font>

387
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:19,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

388
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the hell did these
two guys end up here?</font>

389
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not part of your betrayal?</font>

390
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:24,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. They're not part of your betrayal?</font>

391
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:25,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

392
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:26,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose betrayal is this?</font>

393
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:30,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done with betrayals.</font>

394
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:32,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to put an end to this.</font>

395
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:33,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan?</font>

396
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:37,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, sir, operations just
said they need one of us</font>

397
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:39,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">to unlock the door to Red Robin</font>

398
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">to let some wedding party inside the mall.</font>

399
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw them, they'll have
to fend for themselves.</font>

400
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait,</font>

401
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red Robin wedding?</font>

402
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's getting married?</font>

403
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Hanks and Beyonce.</font>

404
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Oh, my God,</font>

405
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone loves Tom Hanks and Beyonce!</font>

406
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta save them!</font>

407
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Kyle,</font>

408
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:59,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I have a better idea.</font>

409
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't our war, you guys.</font>

410
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">It never was.</font>

411
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been pitted against
each other by two companies</font>

412
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the sake of marketing.</font>

413
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why they want
lines around the block.</font>

414
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they want a war
to promote their product.</font>

415
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:14,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't give a crap what
kind of friendships it costs.</font>

416
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two want a war so bad,
then you fucking fight.</font>

417
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

418
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let's finish it, you and me,</font>

419
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">right here.</font>

420
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:30,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winner take all.</font>

421
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude, this is pretty sweet.</font>

422
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:36,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let this be your
last fight, Bill Gates.</font>

423
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, fellas, what did I miss?</font>

424
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this wiener.</font>

425
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:52,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judge it by its size.</font>

426
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:55,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rub it three times, and it has a surprise.</font>

427
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, you're not
delaying this anymore,</font>

428
00:17:58,586 --> 00:17:59,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">you wiener-loving bitch!</font>

429
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy holidays, Rick.</font>

430
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to you, my friend.</font>

431
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab it, Rebecca, grab it!</font>

432
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:30,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kiss my fat vagina!</font>

433
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me that camera.
- Give it up!</font>

434
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back, get out of my way.</font>

435
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Marsh.</font>

436
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know that your son
is supposed to be grounded</font>

437
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?</font>

438
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Stan's at the Red Robin wedding too?</font>

439
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:59,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, I really care about him.</font>

440
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:05,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is over. Now you die!</font>

441
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over.</font>

442
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xbox wins!</font>

443
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:20,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay, Xbox wins. Yay.</font>

444
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, you're alive!</font>

445
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saved you!</font>

446
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, Beyonce, the fight's over.</font>

447
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:30,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can still shop.</font>

448
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, kids.</font>

449
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get your Xboxes.</font>

450
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:00,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can Elmo smell your genitals?</font>

451
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy holidays, guys. What
can you interest you in?</font>

452
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to get Xbox ones please.</font>

453
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good choice.</font>

454
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom, the shopping frenzy is over,</font>

455
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it looks like Microsoft's new Xbox one</font>

456
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:21,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">is this year's hot item.</font>

457
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doubt this will secure its place</font>

458
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">as the go-to next gen console.</font>

459
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black Friday is over.</font>

460
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been death, violence,</font>

461
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">horrible human behavior,</font>

462
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:35,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the big winner here
decidedly is Channel 9 News.</font>

463
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">The interface is pretty cool.</font>

464
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:47,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I told you guys it's
really a seamless interface.</font>

465
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it is.</font>

466
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">The graphics are definitely
10% better than the old Xbox.</font>

467
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that... that's pretty nice.</font>

468
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys want to play outside or something?</font>

469
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman, your side won, dude.</font>

470
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you so sad?</font>

471
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just... I can't get
the image of Bill Gates</font>

472
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">bashing that guy's head
apart out of my eyes.</font>

473
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:13,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know what you mean.</font>

474
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:17,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look, guys. Xbox won
the console wars, I mean...</font>

475
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:20,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we going to
do, not play video games?</font>

476
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:22,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last few weeks we've been
too busy to play video games,</font>

477
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">and look at what we did.</font>

478
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been drama, action, romance.</font>

479
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, honestly, you guys,</font>

480
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">do we need video games to play?</font>

481
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's right.
- He's trying to make a point.</font>

482
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we started to rely on
Microsoft and Sony so much</font>

483
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:37,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we forgot that all we need
to play are the simplest things</font>

484
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">like... like this! We
can just play with this!</font>

485
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw video games, dude.
Who fucking needs them?</font>

486
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:43,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yeah!</font>

487
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:44,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck 'Em!</font>

488
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The South Park video game,</font>

489
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming to stores soon.</font>

490
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and if you believe that</font>

491
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a big, floppy wiener</font>

492
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:51,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">to dangle in your face.</font>
