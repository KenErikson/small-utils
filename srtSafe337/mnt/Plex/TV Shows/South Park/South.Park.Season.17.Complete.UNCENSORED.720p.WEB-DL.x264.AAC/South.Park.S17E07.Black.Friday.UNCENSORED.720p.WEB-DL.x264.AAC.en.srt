- On our own, none.</font>

65

<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we plan, strategize,
and fight together,</font>

66
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can be the first people
inside on black Friday</font>

67

gearing up.</font>

74

around 3:00 a.M.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We, uh, douse ourselves
in pig blood,</font>

76

slip through the crowd</font>

faces off</font>

126

<font color="#FFFFFF">While holiday music played
in the background.</font>

127
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a woman pick up
her daughter by the ankle</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">And swing her
into some old guy's head.</font>

all around me fighting, clawing.</font>

130
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then a hand reached in
and pulled me out.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Old cap.
He saved us all that day.</font>

135
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,498

Are you enjoying it?</font>

139

I guess.</font>

140

<font color="#FFFFFF">They show a guy's wiener
that guy's character is gay?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?</font>

143
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, it's just that they have
a lot of girls' boobs</font>

144
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">And vaginas and stuff,</font>

145
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">But most times
they show a man's wiener,</font>

146
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's because that guy's in
a love scene with another guy.</font>

147
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think it's because
gay wieners are less threatening</font>

148
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">To women viewers?</font>

149

the greater point of show,</font>

150
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,558

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I know.</font>

152
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winter is coming,</font>

153
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's dragons and zombies
on the way.</font>

154
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty excited
for that.</font>

155
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just can do with a little less
gay wiener is all.</font>

156
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have word
from the kindergartners.</font>

157

<font color="#FFFFFF">They've agreed to join us.</font>

158
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,675

are as good as ours.</font>

159
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
- Wait, wait.</font>

160
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about,
xbox ones?</font>

161
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's what
this is all about, craig.</font>

162
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all trying to get
xbox ones on black Friday.</font>

163
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought we were getting
playstation 4s.</font>

164
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Uh, me too.</font>

165
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, guys,</font>

166
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I said we're gonna get
the next gen gaming systems,</font>

167
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was obviously talking
about xboxes.</font>

168
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I want a ps4,
not a crappy xbox.</font>

169
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, guys.</font>

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have to agree
on one system.</font>

171
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If some of us are on ps4s,
but the rest of us are on xboxes</font>

172
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we all
can't play together online.</font>

173
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? This is all about
committing to one machine.</font>

174
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
Let's all get ps4s.</font>

175
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, the xboxes
are gonna be better.</font>

176
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're not better,
they're just more expensive.</font>

177
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are getting xbox ones,
guys, and that is final.</font>

178
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's exactly
how xbox people are.</font>

179
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Fine!</font>

180
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you guys don't wanna
join us on black Friday</font>

181
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get xboxes,
then that's fine!</font>

182
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're still going to fight
on black Friday,</font>

183
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just not with you.</font>

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, it's going to be
like that, is it?</font>

185
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everyone who wants
to get ps4s, join with us.</font>

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, we can't divide
like this.</font>

187
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, you're on our side,
right?</font>

188
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I like the ps4's
controller better.</font>

189
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stan, the ps4 doesn't have
the seamless transition</font>

190
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between games, movies, and tv
offered by xbox one.</font>

191
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The ps4 controller
has a touchpad interface.</font>

192
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never listen.</font>

193
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I thought
the ps4 was better,</font>

194
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you never wanted
to listen to me, kyle.</font>

195
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just had your head so set
because...</font>

196
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's
how xbox people are.</font>

197
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then I guess I'll see you
on black Friday.</font>

198
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If I see you at the mall,
kyle,</font>

199
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have to try
to beat you inside.</font>

200
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,516

201
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,684

202
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,286

You're up, huh?</font>

209
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh—
all right, look.</font>

210
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took a temp job at the mall.</font>

211

<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to make
some extra holiday cash.</font>

212

213
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I did, sharon!</font>

214
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw they were hiring
extra security,</font>

215
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought it'd be a good way
to make money.</font>

216
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,323

has thought of it, sharon.</font>

00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it, sir?</font>

296
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A new elmo doll.</font>

297
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're releasing
a new elmo doll</font>

298
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just in time
for black Friday.</font>

299
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, christ, no.</font>

300
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've murdered us,
you soulless monsters.</font>

301
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've killed us all.</font>

302
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, god,
they're already lining up.</font>

303
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Elmoooo.</font>

304
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, they can't line up
this soon.</font>

305
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is crazy.
- I'll deal with these demons.</font>

306
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're here
for black Friday,</font>

307
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">The line starts on that side
of the rope.</font>

308
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This rope right here?</font>

309
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's the line
for black Friday</font>

310
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">So other people can do
normal shopping today.</font>

311
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, okay, thanks.</font>

312
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:31,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Elmoooo.</font>

313
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me elmo.</font>

314
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We come seeking your help.</font>

315
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you side
with those wanting xboxes,</font>

316
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or will you join us
on black Friday</font>

317
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">And fight for ps4s?</font>

318
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you for real?</font>

319
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know that the ps4
is a better choice.</font>

320
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, come on.</font>

321
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course we're going to go
with the ps4.</font>

322
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're blacker.
- Then join us.</font>

323
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need people to help us
be the first 20 inside the mall.</font>

324
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, we're just gonna wait</font>

325
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the ps4s become cheaper
and more available.</font>

326
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, you can't do that.
- You can't do that.</font>

327
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't you see?</font>

328
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about more
than black Friday.</font>

329
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Battle lines are being drawn.</font>

330
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wait it out</font>

331
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">But everyone else has already
decided to go with xbox,</font>

332
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then that will
become the standard.</font>

333
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ps4 would be like
what betamax was to vhs.</font>

334
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's betamax?</font>

335
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Exactly.</font>

336
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's vhs?</font>

337
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, we're just asking people
who want to play on ps4s</font>

338
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">To fight
for what they believe in.</font>

339
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, I guess
we just don't care enough.</font>

340
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, sir stan.</font>

341
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be kids somewhere
who will join us.</font>

342
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lady mckormick, I was hoping
I could talk to you about kyle.</font>

343
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not sure if his heart
is in the right place.</font>

344
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he were
to ever switch sides,</font>

345
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could make stan's army
problematic for us.</font>

346
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">- True,
but we can't let kyle</font>

347
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in the way
of what's rightfully ours.</font>

348
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's face it,
lady mckormick,</font>

349
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really about you and me
getting xbox ones.</font>

350
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">The others are simply there</font>

351
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">To help us get
inside those doors.</font>

352
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have a strong influence
over the rest of the men,</font>

353
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lady mckormick.</font>

354
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I'm saying is that
when the time comes,</font>

355
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might need you
to use that influence</font>

356
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">To have kyle taken care of.</font>

357
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we understand each other?</font>

358
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, you damn kids!
Get the hell out of my yard.</font>

359
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fuck you, dude.
This is the garden of andros.</font>

360
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it's my damn garden,</font>

361
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm sick of you kids
dressing up</font>

362
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">And having talks of betrayal
in it.</font>

363
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ buzz, buzz, buzz</font>

364
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ buzz, buzz, buzz</font>

365
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">70-inch television.</font>

366
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be good.</font>

367
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, but 60% off a computer.</font>

368
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll be able
to snag both.</font>

369
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Doing all right there, rookie?
- Oh! Yes, sir.</font>

370
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.</font>

371
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I was just looking
at all these great things</font>

372
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't afford.</font>

373
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen, I know why you took
this part-time job.</font>

374
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You—you do?</font>

375
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see it in you.
You care about people.</font>

376
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same reason
I do it every year.</font>

377
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me of my son.</font>

378
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">He died on black Friday
in '89.</font>

379
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I'm still trying
to save him.</font>

380
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I just want to say I—</font>

381
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really appreciate
what you're doing.</font>

382
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised my wife this would be
the last black Friday I worked.</font>

383
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I see folks like you,</font>

384
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes me hopeful
that people will still be okay.</font>

385
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, awesome.</font>

386
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw, damn it, no lining up
behind the velvet rope.</font>

387
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just don't listen.</font>

388
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buzz, buzz.</font>

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cartman's army is getting
bigger every day.</font>

390
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">In addition to the federation
and the kindergartners,</font>

391
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">The xbox army now also
has the kids</font>

392
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who play <i>harry potter,</i>
<i>the jocks,</i></font>

393
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">The swim team,
and the glee club.</font>

394
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Word is that the sixth graders
all prefer xbox too</font>

395
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">And will team up
with cartman as well.</font>

396
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And who do we have
on our side?</font>

397
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Besides us, it's the book club
and janice pinkerton.</font>

398
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you ask the vamp kids?
- They're still undecided.</font>

399
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There has to be a way
to get people on the fence</font>

400
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">To join our side.</font>

401
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Playstation.</font>

402
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, sir stan, it's probably
time to give this up.</font>

403
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're just
a dying breed, stan.</font>

404
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Xbox is going to win
this whole thing.</font>

405
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So we're just going
to let other kids decide</font>

406
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which game system
we all play on?</font>

407
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would they do
on <i>game of thrones?</i></font>

408
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would they do
when things look their darkest?</font>

409
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh?</font>

410
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, to disturb you, sir,</font>

411
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we thought
you should see this.</font>

412
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:57,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">"winter is coming.</font>

413
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Choose side."</font>

414
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just a small town
in middle america,</font>

415
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">But apparently
a war's escalating.</font>

416
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir, if this were to become
a news story,</font>

417
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if the first people
inside that mall all got xboxes,</font>

418
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It clearly looks bad
for our image.</font>

419
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going to be
the big item</font>

420
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone goes for
this black Friday?</font>

421
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just might be
the playstation 4.</font>

422
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sony has just announced</font>

423
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're offering
a special black Friday bundle</font>

424
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Called
the "brack Friday bunduru",</font>

425
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which will include
four controllers,</font>

426
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">A map of japan, $100 rebate,</font>

427
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">And allow you
to automatically preorder</font>

428
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">For metal gear solid 5.</font>

429
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doubt sony
has just raised the stakes.</font>

430
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
Good, federation kids.</font>

431
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're learning to fight
with your hands.</font>

432
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep pushing,
kindergartners.</font>

433
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir kyle,
I know that sony's offering</font>

434
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">A special
black Friday bunduru.</font>

435
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the xbox
is still better, right?</font>

436
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but why can't xbox</font>

437
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Automatically let you
preorder metal gear solid 5?</font>

438
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir kyle, preorder doesn't
mean shit, okay?</font>

439
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you preorder a game,</font>

440
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just committing
to paying for something</font>

441
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">That some assholes
in california</font>

00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't even finished
working on yet.</font>

443
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you get
for preordering a game?</font>

444
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">A big dick in your mouth.</font>

445
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, listen up.</font>

446
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mall's no longer
allowing people</font>

447
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">To line up for black Friday
until thanksgiving night.</font>

448
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

449
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">To hold places in line,
we're handing out wristbands.</font>

450
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh! Oh, god!
Oh, my god!</font>

451
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wristbands!</font>

452
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back! Back all of you!</font>

453
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's how you are,
there'll be no wristbands.</font>

454
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now go!
- Ow!</font>

455
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back away.</font>

456
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm getting my son
that elmo doll, you fuck!</font>

457
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:58,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!</font>

458
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You did good.
The watch is yours now.</font>

459
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:08,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, you can't die.
Everybody really likes you.</font>

460
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is what
we signed up for,</font>

461
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, my friend?</font>

462
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I was lying to you.</font>

463
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took this job to be
at the front of the line</font>

464
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">On black Friday.</font>

465
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:24,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ha. Now you know
how serious this is.</font>

466
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever your intentions before,
protect this town.</font>

467
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in charge now.</font>

468
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this.</font>

469
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let black Friday
be the end.</font>

470
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:02,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get back inside.
We have work to do.</font>

471
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When we started this fight,</font>

472
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was because we were tired
of xbox people</font>

473
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Telling us
playstation sucked.</font>

474
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're an army of our own.</font>

475
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:23,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't guarantee
you will live,</font>

476
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can guarantee
that before this is over</font>

477
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">The winner of the console wars
will be decided.</font>

478
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our new leader has joined us</font>

479
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">To help make sure that system
is the ps4.</font>

480
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:41,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">All hail the princess!</font>

481
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">The princess.</font>

482
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">To line up for black Friday
until thanksgiving night.</font>

483
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,385

Oh, my god!</font>
