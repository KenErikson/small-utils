writing your feelings down in a poem?</font>

Laurel what we do now?"</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">So Token you should be cool
while we're all here at school.</font>

163
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I go back to class now?
- Eric, d'you feel better about all this?</font>

164
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:44,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah I do. I think we
really had a breakthrough here.</font>

165
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thanks, Token.</font>

166
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:50,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be okay. I
think we're all safe now.</font>

what the hell is going on.</font>

213
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:33,178

the contagion can't reach us.</font>

- My wife didn't make the plane.</font>

216

219
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know anything. First
there was talks of a hijacking,</font>

- From the looks of it,</font>

229
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,624

safe to land in Los Angeles.</font>

take the plane to Los Angeles?</font>

236
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:49,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a chance. By now most of the
urban cities has to be compromised.</font>

tell him how you feel?</font>

262

you, Token, you let it go,</font>

00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">is asked to contact the
authorities immediately.</font>

296
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy moly.</font>

297
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you?</font>

298
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:34,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay by the window, tell
me if anything changes.</font>

299
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something that can shoot with
complete accuracy from the distance.</font>

300
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:40,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, you want a rifle,
like this.22 caliber.</font>

301
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it you intend to shoot?
- A person.</font>

302
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean a person who's threatening you?</font>

303
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:51,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Threatening all of us!
- Please, hurry, it's important.</font>

304
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:54,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be fine so long as
the person breaks into your house</font>

305
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">and is an immediate threat to you.</font>

306
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? How am I supposed to get
a person to break into my house?</font>

307
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't shoot someone who
threatens you just out on the street,</font>

308
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:05,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless of course you're in a state
that has a stand your ground law.</font>

309
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:07,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stand my ground?
- Please, we're running out of time.</font>

310
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:11,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, now with a stand your ground
law you can legally shoot someone</font>

311
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:13,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's threatening you whether
they're in your house or not.</font>

312
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, that's what I need. I'll take that.
- No, you have to be in the state</font>

313
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a stand your ground law, like Florida.</font>

314
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is hopeless.</font>

315
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed to shoot Token
with all these stupid rules?</font>

316
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute... I can't shoot Token,</font>

317
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?</font>

318
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So long as they're threatening you.
- What? What is it, please?</font>

319
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:36,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hurry, my husband might still be alive.
- The other way to stop the outbreak...</font>

320
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Token isn't the only patient zero.</font>

321
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:42,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">The outbreak won't happen
if we shoot George Zimmerman.</font>

322
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get to Florida.</font>

323
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, let's go,
move, move, move, lets go!</font>

324
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:52,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Find the closest airport in Florida!
- This plane is going to Baltimore.</font>

325
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't get to Florida there's
not going to be a Baltimore left.</font>

326
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:58,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black guy in the back!</font>

327
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, now let's find Zimmerman!</font>

328
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put this on. We have to
stay hidden from here out.</font>

329
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:23,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are we going to do?
- I'm going to flush out patient zero,</font>

330
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're going to shoot
him. It's the only way.</font>

331
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he attacks us first?</font>

332
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, nobody can
see us wearing black.</font>

333
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:33,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had time to
thank you for doing what...</font>

334
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eat your breakfast, girls.
- Where's daddy?</font>

335
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can eat without your
father in the room. Now hurry!</font>

336
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:52,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Daddy!
- Good morning, girls!</font>

337
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saved daddy any pancakes?</font>

338
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:58,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that, 6:00 A.M. and
my family's already smiling.</font>

339
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:00,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd I get such a perfect
husband, George Zimmerman?</font>

340
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:02,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how did I get such a perfect wife?</font>

341
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, dad.</font>

342
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:07,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you too, princess.
I love both of you, equally.</font>

343
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing can ever go wrong so
long as we have each other.</font>

344
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any hope for
stopping the zombie apocalypse?</font>

345
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">A CNN has just recieved word</font>

346
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:17,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the government has learned
the identity of patient zero.</font>

347
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nine-year-old threat to
humanity has been tracked down</font>

348
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">and measures are being taken to stop him.</font>

349
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:25,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy, what's a patient zero?</font>

350
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Mr. Zimmerman!
Your country needs you.</font>

351
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:33,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you need from me?
- We...</font>

352
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:36,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">need you to shoot a young
African-American for us.</font>

353
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:42,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I gave that up.
- You're the best, Zimmerman.</font>

354
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:45,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need you to do it one more
time for to the security of the world.</font>

355
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dammit, I have a wife and kids now.</font>

356
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then do it for your family! This is
about protecting people, Zimmerman.</font>

357
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:55,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keeping our streets safe so the
children are free to go out and smell...</font>

358
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:58,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's wrong. Look out!</font>

359
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:04,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My God, I didn't even see him.
- Nice work, Zimmerman.</font>

360
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:07,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you guys okay?
- What was that, daddy?</font>

361
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">- More needless violence.
- Nonsense,</font>

362
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">you did what you had to. You're a hero.</font>

363
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:16,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">That may be true but I'll have to
live with this the rest of my life</font>

364
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though I'll be walking
around as a free man.</font>

365
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:22,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait a minute, this
kid isn't black, he's white.</font>

366
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

367
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:24,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilty!</font>

368
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">The zombie apocalypse is over.</font>

369
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the panic, crashing planes and chaos</font>

370
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:47,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">appear to have for some reason
died with George Zimmerman.</font>

371
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as for the little boy who
was so mercilessly gunned down</font>

372
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">although he survived the shooting,
his wishes are to remain anonymous,</font>

373

his nickname: "Brad Pitt"...</font>

374

<font color="#FFFFFF">"But cooler."</font>

375
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sure wasn't much
of a zombie apocalypse.</font>

376
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:05,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's sucked.</font>

377
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least I bet Token's glad
it's over with. Aren't you Token?</font>

378
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:25,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Token. What's up, bro?</font>

379
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:28,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it going, dude?
I know how it feels now.</font>

380
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made everything think
I'm a ing patient zero.</font>

381
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:36,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
- So what.</font>

382
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sounds like your still angry, Token.
- you!</font>

383
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:47,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, Token, come
on, this is ridiculous.</font>

384
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:50,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you totally want
to kick my ass right now.</font>

385
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like to walk right
up and punch me in the face,</font>

386
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what's that's going to solve?</font>

387
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a way better idea.</font>

388
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fist bump?</font>

389
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, dude. Fist bump!</font>

390
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,547

inside the red line is mine.</font>

393

my ground. He was on it.</font>
