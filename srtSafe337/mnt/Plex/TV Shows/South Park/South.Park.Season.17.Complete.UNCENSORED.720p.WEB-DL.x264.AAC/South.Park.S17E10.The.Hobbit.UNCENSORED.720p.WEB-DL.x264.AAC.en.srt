<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, lisa,
that's great.</font>

25
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,998

some more confidence, okay?</font>

a crush on butters.</font>

that's great.</font>

that you like him?</font>

37
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No way.
I'd just get made fun of.</font>

38
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lisa, this is exactly
what you need.</font>

39
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take butters
to see a movie or something.</font>

40

for your confidence.</font>

the fella with the moustache</font>

and the lady takes out a gun</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, excuse me, butters?</font>

45
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,372

46
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um, well...</font>

47
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just wondering
if maybe</font>

48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would like to go
to a movie this weekend.</font>

49
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
Oh, like a date?</font>

50
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no thanks, lisa.</font>

51
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really
appreciate the offer,</font>

52
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're
too fat for me.</font>

53
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, thanks.</font>

54
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See ya, lisa!</font>

55
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ha ha, butters got
asked out by a fat girl.</font>

56
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- At least she didn't
try to sit on him.</font>

57
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You guys, come on,
that's not cool.</font>

58
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't rip on her
because she's fat.</font>

59
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should rip on her
because she's ugly, okay?</font>

60
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks like someone hit her
in the face with a hot shovel,</font>

61
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's
why she sucks, all right?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a really nice girl.</font>

00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,729

a nice girl too.</font>

77
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's just too big for me.</font>

78
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's a little overweight,
but that's pretty normal</font>

83
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have a different standard
when it comes to my women.</font>

84
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a woman
who takes care of herself</font>

00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">And knows how
to look good.</font>

86
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's got perfect skin,</font>

87
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no splotches on her legs,
and perfect everything.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Kim kardashian is a short,
overweight woman</font>

91
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:11,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who manipulates her image</font>

92
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And makes average girls
feel horrible about themselves.</font>

- Look it up, stupid.</font>

kim kardashian</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Has the body

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, take a seat, wendy.</font>

100
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess some
mean things were said,</font>

101
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I need to get
to the bottom of it.</font>

102
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, good.
Lisa berger told on you?</font>

103
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

104
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, no, wendy,
apparently,</font>

105
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called
butters' girlfriend a hobbit.</font>

106
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you serious?
- You did!</font>

107
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said kim is short,
fat, and hairy, with big feet,</font>

108
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's a hobbit!</font>

109
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's not his girlfriend.</font>

110
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kim kardashian.</font>

111
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But—but, wendy,
kim kardashian</font>

112
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is considered to be
extremely beautiful, mkay?</font>

113
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, but she's not
in real life.</font>

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a hobbit.
- Oh, she said it again!</font>

115
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, wendy,
kim might be full figured,</font>

116
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a woman's outward appearance
isn't all that matters, mkay?</font>

117
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you stopped to consider
that maybe, just maybe</font>

118
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're jel?</font>

119
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am not "jel,"
and I happen to be</font>

120
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">The biggest feminist
at this school.</font>

121
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That may be true,</font>

122
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is
a very fine line, wendy,</font>

123
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between being a feminist
and being a hater, mkay?</font>

124
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're gonna have
to find that line,</font>

125
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because nobody likes
a girl who's jelly.</font>

126
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, kids, there have been
some hurtful and hateful things</font>

127
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being said
around this school,</font>

128
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so we are gonna hear
from a guest speaker.</font>

129
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here to explain why
kim kardashian is not a hobbit,</font>

130
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please welcome aquaman.</font>

131
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, that's right.</font>

132
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-oh.</font>

133
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay,
first of all,</font>

134
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not aquaman.</font>

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a recovering
gay fish.</font>

136
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:57,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I have met aquaman.
I have hung out with aquaman.</font>

137
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the only thing I have
in common with aquaman anymore</font>

138
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my love for the sea.</font>

139
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

140
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">There have been
malicious rumors</font>

141
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Started at this
elementary school</font>

142
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">That my beautiful fiancee
is a hobbit.</font>

143
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not funny,
and it is not true.</font>

144
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

145
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, kim is heavier than move
of her pictures show her to be.</font>

146
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she gets her hair
lasered off her body.</font>

147
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she has a friend
named gandalf</font>

148
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who happens
to be a wizard.</font>

149
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
Excuse me a minute.</font>

150
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:38,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitch, how you not
the hobbit again?</font>

151
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right.</font>

152
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right, right,
right, right, yeah.</font>

153
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yep.
Yep, let me—okay.</font>

154
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep, I got it.
Okay, love you too.</font>

155
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:50,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if my fiancee kim
is a hobbit,</font>

156
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then how come it—
uh, how—then—</font>

157
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, if she is a hobbit,
then how come</font>

158
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">She don't live
in a hole in the ground?</font>

159
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom!
Aw, y'all just got lit up, cup!</font>

160
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">She don't live
in no hole in the ground.</font>

161
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">She lives
in a big-ass mansion with me,</font>

162
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">In her room
that is slightly below ground.</font>

163
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can—</font>

164
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">She—she is sexy
and womanly.</font>

165
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she smokes a pipe.
She can blow them rings</font>

166
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">That go up
over her head, and—</font>

167
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold up.</font>

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitch, you not
a hobbit, right?</font>

169
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:22,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I know, you just—</font>

170
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smoke
that long pipe sometimes</font>

171
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you sit
by the fire.</font>

172
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's a—
oh, okay, got it.</font>

173
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you call it?
Yep, yep, got it.</font>

174
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yep,
love you too.</font>

175
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not a hobbit pipe,
for your information.</font>

176
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a personal
oral humidifier</font>

177
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">To keep all the wrinkles
around her mouth from showing.</font>

178
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">So ha, ha,
all you haters, ha!</font>

179
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Butters, butters,
come here for a sec.</font>

180
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, no you don't,
wendy.</font>

181
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not trapping me inside
the computer lab to beat me up.</font>

182
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Butters, would you please
let me show you something</font>

183
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we can put this
behind us?</font>

184
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right,
but if you try to punch me,</font>

185
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll scream.</font>

186
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want you to see
just how easy this is,</font>

187
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we can better
understand each other.</font>

188
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is lisa berger's
class photo, right?</font>

189
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.</font>

190
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, first thing we do
is just</font>

191
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:08,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Photoshop the bulges
on her sides.</font>

192
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We select the eyes,
make them a nicer shape.</font>

193
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off any blemishes
on the skin.</font>

194
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lengthen the neck.
Add more to the hair.</font>

195
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Select the lips.
Make them fuller.</font>

196
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take out any puffiness
on the skin here.</font>

197
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add fullness to the breasts,
length of the torso.</font>

198
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:20,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take away
that fold of skin.</font>

199
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Streamline the shoulders.
Put highlights in the eyes.</font>

200
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there.</font>

201
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's lisa berger?</font>

202
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you see
what I'm talking about?</font>

203
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's pretty!</font>

204
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's how people
like kim kardashian</font>

205
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroy the self image
of little girls everywhere.</font>

206
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold on.
Are you saying that girl</font>

207
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wants to go out with me?</font>

208
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What—
what do you mean?</font>

209
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I said no?</font>

210
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man,
I gotta upload this,</font>

211
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then go
buy her some flowers,</font>

212
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then go tell her
I love her.</font>

213
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Butters!</font>

214
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lisa?
Lisa berger?</font>

215
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody seen lisa berger?</font>

216
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, eric.
Have you seen</font>

217
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:55,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lisa berger anywhere?</font>

218
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw that picture of her
you put on the internet.</font>

219
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know!
I'm gonna tell her I love her,</font>

220
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're gonna be together
and be happy forever.</font>

221
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, butters, I don't know
how to tell you this,</font>

222
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">But lisa berger is
going out with clyde.</font>

223
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
Since when?</font>

224
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, since, like,
noon or 12:30 today.</font>

225
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, token, token.
Check out my girlfriend.</font>

226
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow, she's hot.</font>

227
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, we just started
dating seriously.</font>

228
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna meet
my new girlfriend, tweek?</font>

229
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, man, you're a lucky guy.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

230
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, clyde,
nice score dude.</font>

231
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

232
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, thanks, guys.</font>

233
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, stan, did you see
clyde's going out</font>

234
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">With lisa berger?</font>

235
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, dude,
she looks amazing.</font>

236
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clyde sent me her pics.</font>

237
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got really hot
all of a sudden.</font>

238
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I wouldn't mind
t—tappin' that ass.</font>

239
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, wendy.</font>

240
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clyde sent me these.
Don't be jel.</font>

241
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why would I be jel?</font>

242
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you got to admit,</font>

243
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lisa berger's
pretty hot, wendy.</font>

244
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's not hot!</font>

245
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's supposed
to be the point.</font>

246
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She looks pretty hot here.</font>

247
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lisa berger is not hot.
She's fat and ugly.</font>

248
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's not
very nice, wendy.</font>

249
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your problem, wendy?</font>

250
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
It's nothing personal, lisa.</font>

251
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're just a hater.</font>

252
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you mind your own
business instead of being jelly?</font>

253
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am not jelly!</font>

254
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made that picture of you
to prove a point,</font>

255
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's being taken
the wrong way.</font>

256
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay, babe,
girls that don't have</font>

257
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you have
are always gonna put you down.</font>

258
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, babe.</font>

259
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, wendy, I have tried
to be patient with you</font>

260
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you've always
been a good student, mkay?</font>

261
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:34,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">But calling a little girl
fat and ugly is never mkay.</font>

262
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey,
I was trying to show kids that—</font>

263
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! No excuses!</font>

264
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a problem
being jelly, wendy, mkay?</font>

265
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just maybe I should have you
sent off to jelly school.</font>

266
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jelly school?
- That's right.</font>

267
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I'm gonna call
the jelly school right now.</font>

268
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mkay, I'm sorry about this,
but it's gone too far.</font>

269
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had it.</font>

270
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, is this
the jelly school?</font>

271
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mkay, I have a girl here
who's extremely jelly.</font>

272
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was seeing if you could
take her in for a few weeks.</font>

273
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mkay, you're full?</font>

274
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah, I guess she
dodged a bullet this time,</font>

275
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she better watch
her jelly behavior.</font>

276
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Mackey, I appreciate
the point you're trying to make.</font>

277
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You—you do?</font>

278
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mkay, well, I'm not
actually on the phone</font>

279
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the jelly school,
wendy, mkay?</font>

280
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes. I'm—</font>

281
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a few steps
ahead of that, yes.</font>

282
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mkay, well, wendy,
I'm just trying to, uh—</font>

283
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bye, jelly school.</font>

284
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, wendy, I'm just trying
to make you understand</font>

285
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">How serious it is when you
lash out at other girls.</font>

286
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, mr. Mackey.
I will change.</font>

287
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mkay.</font>

288
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

289
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is my honor to give
the person of the year award</font>

290
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">To this year's winner...</font>

291
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pope francis.</font>

292
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:53,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>Gracias, gracias,</i>
<i>all of my children.</i></font>

293
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, hold up.
Hold up.</font>

294
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, pope,
but hold up.</font>

295
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,257

about my woman, all right?</font>

313
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She is gorgeous.</font>

314
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,131
