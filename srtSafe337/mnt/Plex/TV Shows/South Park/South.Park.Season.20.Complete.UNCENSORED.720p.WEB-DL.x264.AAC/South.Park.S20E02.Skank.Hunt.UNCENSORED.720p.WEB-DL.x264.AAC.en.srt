00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Internet trolls are truly
predators of society.</font>

12
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">As parents,
we find it hard to believe</font>

13
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">our children are doing
these things online.</font>

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is why I've been asked
to come and speak to you</font>

15
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the student
who has been trolling</font>

16
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">your school message boards.</font>

17
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">This troll is known only
as Skankhunt42.</font>

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">we believe it probable he's
one of the boy students here,</font>

19
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">since his favorite target
seems to be women.</font>

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, you can see
Heidi Turner's mother</font>

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Photoshopped with a penis
in her mouth</font>

22
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">after she defended
her daughter's right</font>

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sit out the national anthem.</font>

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since then, this child has been
trolling all over the Internet,</font>

25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">visiting message boards
and social media</font>

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">and filling it
with vile comments</font>

27
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hate-filled garbage.</font>

28
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">But trolling is on the rise
with teenagers,</font>

29
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we all need to come together
to stop it.</font>

30
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need every parent to look for
the signs in their own child.</font>

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order for us to find
these secretive monsters,</font>

32
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">we need all parents
to ask themselves</font>

33
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">"could my child be a troll?"</font>

34
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, what children
are capable of now.</font>

35
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of hate would have to
be in that's child's heart?</font>

36
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you never know.</font>

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be someone who just...
kind of thinks it's funny</font>

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stir the pot
and watch everyone freak out.</font>

39
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you know, maybe the fact
that it's so<i> not</i> funny</font>

40
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes it somehow funny...
to kids.</font>

41
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gosh, I-I certainly
don't understand it.</font>

42
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude,
what's going on?</font>

43
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't hear?</font>

44
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear what?
What happened?</font>

45
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi Turner — she...</font>

46
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">she quit Twitter.</font>

47
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

48
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday after school.</font>

49
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wrote one last tweet
that said, "Goodbye forever,"</font>

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then just got off for good.</font>

51
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll get back on.</font>

52
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, dude, she threw her phone
in the river.</font>

53
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's — She's gone.</font>

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, students,
I know we're all dealing</font>

55
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the loss of a good friend.</font>

56
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to accept the fact</font>

57
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Heidi won't
be on social media anymore.</font>

58
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we're all gonna miss her.
M'kay?</font>

59
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna miss
seeing what she's up to,</font>

60
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">miss seeing those silly pictures
she'd post</font>

61
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">of her and her friends.</font>

62
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay?</font>

63
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is what can happen
when someone gets bullied online</font>

64
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the point they just can't
go on anymore.</font>

65
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that some of you
are feeling anger, m'kay,</font>

66
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">some of you are feeling
a little guilt,</font>

67
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">and asking how something
like this can happen.</font>

68
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the best thing
we can do for Heidi</font>

69
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">is come together
as friends and as students.</font>

70
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:07,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay?</font>

71
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now why don't we all
get on Twitter, m'kay,</font>

72
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just tweet
some of the things</font>

73
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">we loved about Heidi, m'kay?</font>

74
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay.
Oh, that's nice.</font>

75
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

76
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's a good one, Sarah.
Uh-huh.</font>

77
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's — that's a pretty poem.</font>

78
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice, Butters.</font>

79
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Heidi would have
loved this so much.</font>

80
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so special.
M'kay?</font>

81
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
can we all agree now</font>

82
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">that whoever is doing this
needs to stop?</font>

83
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally, you guys.
This has gone far enough.</font>

84
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls are really
pissed off at us.</font>

85
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tonight,
whoever is doing this</font>

86
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't going
to do it again.</font>

87
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:57,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause if he does,</font>

88
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna have to do
something about it.</font>

89
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that,
guys?</font>

90
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It better not happen
again tonight.</font>

91
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so seriously.</font>

92
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, can I talk to you?</font>

93
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Pull up a chair.</font>

94
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
we had a big parent meeting</font>

95
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:22,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the school tonight.</font>

96
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, apparently,
there's someone</font>

97
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">trolling
the school message boards</font>

98
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:30,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">and putting penises
in people's mouths.</font>

99
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whoever it was
then got a big reaction from it,</font>

100
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he's now putting penises</font>

101
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">in people's mouths
all over the Internet and...</font>

102
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's actually getting
pretty famous.</font>

103
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Annie Jerkins' mother
started an online campaign</font>

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stop Internet trolling</font>

105
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a picture of her
and her daughter,</font>

106
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know what happened?</font>

107
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got a dick
in her mouth.</font>

108
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, I know
it's just guy humor stuff.</font>

109
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
we can laugh about it here,</font>

110
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it is serious,
too.</font>

111
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, love you, pal.
Get to sleep.</font>

112
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a school night.</font>

113
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey!</font>

114
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you talk to him?</font>

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. We talked.
It was good.</font>

116
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's good.</font>

117
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I better go
and get some of my work done.</font>

118
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right,
right, yeah.</font>

119
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, don't wait up.</font>

120
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be a while with these
stupid case profiles.</font>

121
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,747

00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is cool.
So isolated.</font>

298
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check it out.
There's a shovel</font>

299
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">next to a hole
dug in the ground.</font>

300
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, is this where
we're gonna play?</font>

301
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call dibs on this side.</font>

302
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the Wi-Fi called?
Is there a password?</font>

303
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see it. I don't see it
coming up on my laptop.</font>

304
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, I think
maybe the Wi-Fi's not working.</font>

305
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the box? You got to
unplug it and plug it back in.</font>

306
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys?</font>

307
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys... there's...
no Wi-Fi.</font>

308
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls are gonna
do something drastic to us.</font>

309
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to take matters
into our own hands.</font>

310
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you —
What are you guys talking about?</font>

311
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought this
on yourself, Cartman.</font>

312
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry.</font>

313
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

314
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
You guys are gonna</font>

315
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">break all my stuff
so I can't get online.</font>

316
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just put your stuff on the table
and step back.</font>

317
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please! Please, don't break
my stuff, you guys!</font>

318
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is like two Christmases
and a birthday worth of stuff!</font>

319
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can't do this!
Please!</font>

320
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just
get it over with.</font>

321
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't take them from me!
Don't break my stuff!</font>

322
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not Skankhunt!
I'm not!</font>

323
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys — you guys,
you don't have to do this.</font>

324
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.</font>

325
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can still
just play "Counterstrike"</font>

326
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forget everything.</font>

327
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
There's no Wi-Fi.</font>

328
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can use my phone
to make a hot spot!</font>

329
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can still
play "Counterstrike"!</font>

330
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be sweet!
You guys come on, please!</font>

331
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, you can't!
I can't listen to this.</font>

332
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Clyde!
Clyde, you're my friend!</font>

333
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, you — you know how much
I need my stuff!</font>

334
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just
get it over with!</font>

335
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please, if I can't
get online, I won't have a life!</font>

336
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God! No!
Don't! Don't! Don't!</font>

337
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</font>

338
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have we done?</font>

339
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we had to do.</font>

340
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

341
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God damn it.</font>

342
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have got to be kidding me.</font>

343
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Counselor Mackey.</font>

344
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on, Scott?</font>

345
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to God,
I'm gonna do it this time.</font>

346
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Scott,
just try and calm down.</font>

347
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want
to quit Twitter.</font>

348
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does it matter?</font>

349
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">People would be happier
if I just did it!</font>

350
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true.
No one would be happier.</font>

351
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">This fuckin' kid.
Oh, my God.</font>

352
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody thinks
you're a great kid, Scott.</font>

353
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talked to my dad.</font>

354
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said I don't have
the guts to do it.</font>

355
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I quit Twitter,
he'd be sorry!</font>

356
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, um, how about this —</font>

357
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">just, um, promise me
you won't quit Twitter tonight,</font>

358
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can — we can talk
all day tomorrow, okay?</font>

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if I'll make it

361
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for fuck's sake.</font>

362
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just feel like
I'm at the edge of a cliff,</font>

363
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know,
and being chased by hate,</font>

364
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only way out
is to jump.</font>

365
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.
M'kay.</font>

366
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, go on with that.</font>

367
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,308

the kids at school would do</font>

all my social media,</font>

all the damage they've done.</font>
