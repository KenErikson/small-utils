11
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:46,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are live at South
Park Elementary school,</font>

12
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:48,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the local girls volleyball team</font>

13
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">is about to take on
the Jefferson Sabers.</font>

14
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:51,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Jim, it is a packed.</font>

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sell-out crowd tonight... The
first time in team history.</font>

16
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone turning out to
see what's gonna happen.</font>

17
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:01,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Mike. All eyes tonight are
of course on 4th grader Nichole Daniels.</font>

18
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will she sit or stand
for the national anthem?</font>

19
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">This week, with athletes
all over the country</font>

20
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:07,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">sitting down for the national anthem,</font>

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">the question on everyone's mind is,</font>

22
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is this little girl gonna do?</font>

23
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?</font>

24
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:16,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw that. I got a hundred
bucks riding on this.</font>

25
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:18,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Nichole! Sit it out!</font>

26
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:21,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now please rise for the national anthem.</font>

27
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it!</font>

28
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">The national anthem starts.</font>

29
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting.</font>

30
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:32,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, no sign of... Oh, and
Heidi Turner is sitting down!</font>

31
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, this is totally unexpected.</font>

32
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">All eyes were on
Nichole when Heidi Turner</font>

33
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">comes out of nowhere
and sits down for...</font>

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there goes Meagan Ridley!</font>

35
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crowd is going wild.
What a turn of events.</font>

36
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:43,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's check in with Dave.</font>

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ed and Mike, I've just looked
at the girls' Twitter accounts,</font>

38
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it appears they are
sitting out the national anthem</font>

39
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">to protest all the harassment and
trolling they receive on the Internet!</font>

40
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Complete surprise, Dave.
Nobody saw this coming.</font>

41
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three girls now sitting down, and...</font>

42
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">And finally there goes Nichole.</font>

43
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow!
- Yeah, 100 bucks!</font>

44
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now as the anthem draws
to a close, this thing is over.</font>

45
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:06,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">The final result...
Four athletes sitting out</font>

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the national anthem,
three of them not even black.</font>

47
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:10,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">A shocker here in South Park.</font>

48
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for joining us.</font>

49
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:14,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, that was great!</font>

50
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, play ball.</font>

51
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, ladies, first
of all, I want to say</font>

52
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:29,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I completely respect your
decision to protest our national anthem.</font>

53
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was sweet.</font>

54
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you shed some light
on some very important issues</font>

55
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">regarding gender equality.</font>

56
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing about Eric Cartman?</font>

57
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies, I understand you're upset about</font>

58
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:39,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">the trolling you've
received on the Internet.</font>

59
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is no evidence that
Eric Cartman is skankhunt42.</font>

60
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is him. It's completely obvious,</font>

61
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">and nobody's doing anything about it.</font>

62
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:47,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he claims that he's been working</font>

63
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">at changing himself and
the world around him.</font>

64
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send in Mr. Cartman.</font>

65
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:53,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to see me, PC Principal?</font>

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.</font>

67
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:58,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you or are you not the
Internet troll skankhunt42?</font>

68
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's skank-hunt42, and no, I am not.</font>

69
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lying. Make him show you his phone.</font>

70
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, that'd be a
breach of my civil rights.</font>

71
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can assure you, nobody respected</font>

72
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">you girls' poignant
protests more than I did.</font>

73
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellow Senators, our nation
is divided like never before.</font>

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">While people everywhere fight
for their voices to be heard,</font>

75
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps it is time for us to consider</font>

76
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:26,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">that our national anthem
needs to be changed.</font>

77
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Americans need an anthem
that inspires and excites,</font>

78
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">an anthem that has
something for everyone,</font>

79
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">while still paying tribute
to what it once was.</font>

80
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:37,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe there's
only one person capable</font>

81
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">of achieving this...</font>

82
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">J.J. Abrams.</font>

83
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, J.J. Abrams!</font>

84
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saved "Star Wars,"</font>

85
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:50,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now we will ask
him to save our country.</font>

86
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Abrams?</font>

87
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:04,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.</font>

88
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:07,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look there.</font>

89
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Abrams, I speak on behalf
of Americans everywhere.</font>

90
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come to ask you to
reboot the national anthem.</font>

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Mr. Abrams,</font>

92
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">we know you've been
asked to reboot a lot.</font>

93
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you're tired.</font>

94
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:24,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know you're tired.</font>

95
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:25,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say, sir?</font>

96
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all want something new,</font>

97
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:30,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that makes us remember
the things we loved.</font>

98
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:31,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want to member.</font>

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your memberberries!</font>

100
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">One light means yes.</font>

101
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two lights means no.</font>

102
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:52,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellow students, as you
know, an Internet troll</font>

103
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:55,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the name of skankhunt42 has
been harassing women and girls</font>

104
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">by making degrading comments
on our school message board.</font>

105
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls are very upset,
and many male students believe</font>

106
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it's just because girls
don't have a sense of humor.</font>

107
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg to disagree.</font>

108
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls rule. Women are
funny. Get over it.</font>

109
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the other day in the hallway,</font>

110
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:11,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard two male students saying how
the new "Ghostbusters" sucked balls.</font>

111
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:12,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was shocked and appalled.</font>

112
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:14,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is time for us all
to realize and accept</font>

113
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">that girls are cool and women are funny.</font>

114
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wendy? Wendy, could you
come up here, please?</font>

115
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on up, Wendy.
Wendy Testaburger, guys.</font>

116
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wendy, go ahead. Be funny.</font>

117
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:31,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say something funny,
Wendy. We can't wait.</font>

118
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not funny.</font>

119
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, girls are funny
Wendy, okay? Get over it.</font>

120
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:36,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do women's comedy
stuff... You know, talk about</font>

121
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">how fat you are and how you
want to have sex with guys</font>

122
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:40,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then say "my vagina!" a lot.</font>

123
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't feel like being funny right now.</font>

124
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's just the kind of sexist bull
crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen.</font>

125
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit your ass down.</font>

126
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a joke, you
guys. Girls are funny.</font>

127
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:49,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bebe, why don't you come up here.</font>

128
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:51,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Bebe.</font>

129
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

130
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

131
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, talk about having sex with guys
and say "vagina!" and stuff like that.</font>

132
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

133
00:05:57,846 --> 00:06:00,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls rule. Women are funny.
Bebe, get over yourself, seriously.</font>

134
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the mic out of my face!</font>

135
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Oh, my God, that
wasn't really all that funny.</font>

136
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's weird. Um...</font>

137
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see. Red, you got
any zingers for the crowd?</font>

138
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:09,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? How about you, Nelly?</font>

139
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck.</font>

140
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Kay, that wasn't really
funny. It was just angry.</font>

141
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, what the problem is,
is that when a little troll</font>

142
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:18,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">is allowed to say anything
he wants anonymously,</font>

143
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">then he speaks for all you boys.</font>

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Kay, that's good. Now, just try
and say it a little bit funnier now.</font>

145
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and get on
our school message board</font>

146
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see what he's saying about us.</font>

147
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:29,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then see if you guys think it's funny.</font>

00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:32,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, and then... and then...
And then just go "my vagina!"</font>

149
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:36,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as our country seems
to be more and more divided,</font>

150
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:39,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only hope is that J.J.
Abrams' new national anthem</font>

151
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:42,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">will appeal to everyone and bring back</font>

152
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">those nostalgic memberberries
we know and love.</font>

153

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great.</font>

154
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:49,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's getting a reboot now.</font>

155
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, sir. I'm with the Gallup poll.</font>

156
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying to get a read on how people</font>

157
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be voting in the
upcoming presidential election.</font>

158
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh, okay.</font>

159
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. And will you be
voting for the Giant Douche</font>

160
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the Turd Sandwich?</font>

161
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is usually a
Giant Douche household,</font>

162
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we are going firmly
with the Turd Sandwich.</font>

163
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, the Turd Sandwich, huh?
- That's right.</font>

164
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:14,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can put my wife and I
both down for Turd Sandwich.</font>

165
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good luck with that.</font>

166
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:19,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, Giant Douche
is leading in the polls.</font>

167
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:22,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

168
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is wrong with people?</font>

169
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:28,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">They really think that a Giant Douche
should be president? It's insane!</font>

170
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you say I'd be voting
for the Turd Sandwich, Randy?</font>

171
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't even talked to me about it.</font>

172
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:36,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't possibly be thinking
about voting for the douche.</font>

173
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you?</font>

174
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't understand
why every four years,</font>

175
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">you people freak out over whether to vote
for a Giant Douche or a Turd Sandwich.</font>

176
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're Americans.</font>

177
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause this is America.</font>

178
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:48,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we doing this again?</font>

179
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we back to Giant
Douche and Turd Sandwich?</font>

180
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:51,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cynical...</font>

181
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cynical man!</font>

182
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just think everything
and everyone is dumb, huh?</font>

183
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:59,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 'Cause you're a
kneel-ist? - It's ni-hi-list.</font>

184
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? You're such a nihilist.</font>

185
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">The newest Gallup poll results are in,</font>

186
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:05,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they show Giant Douche
to be leading Turd Sandwich</font>

187
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">by nearly 10%.</font>

there is no need to panic.</font>

190
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:14,264

191
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:16,043

any momentum from this poll?</font>

we're president and vice president,</font>

446
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, 'member?
- Ooh, 'member?</font>

447
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:34,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck going on
with these memberberries?</font>

448
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

449
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Broship. Got a minute?</font>

450
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

451
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right, Kyle, okay?</font>

452
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drew the vagina on my face.</font>

453
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to fool people,
but you keenly noticed</font>

454
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:49,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">my one tiny error in that
girls don't have balls.</font>

455
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to the bathroom.</font>

456
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, you have to try and
appreciate what I'm doing.</font>

457
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:56,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that a war is coming
between us and the girls.</font>

458
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:58,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it the moment they
sat out the national anthem.</font>

459
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sat it out because you
were harassing them online!</font>

460
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:03,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose for one second
that I'm not skankhunt42</font>

461
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:06,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that I really have been
doing what I've been doing</font>

462
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">to try and stop the damage he has done.</font>

463
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you care?</font>

464
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm scared, Kyle.</font>

465
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:12,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know if you've noticed,
but race wars are back,</font>

466
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now if we get gender wars, too?</font>

467
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we could just prove
who the troll was,</font>

468
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">then the girls wouldn't be
wanting a war, would they?</font>

469
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you can't track
down an Internet troll.</font>

470
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too bad.</font>

471
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:26,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just know this, Cartman...
I'm going to prove</font>

472
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:29,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">who skankhunk42 is, whatever it takes.</font>

473
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone is going to know,</font>

474
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:35,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">and skankhunt is gonna pay
for everything he's ever said.</font>

475
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, everyone.</font>

476
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are live at tonight's game</font>

477
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">between the 49ers and the Panthers.</font>

478
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:45,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">But of course what everyone
is really here for...</font>

479
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">The unveiling of the
new national anthem,</font>

480
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">rebooted by J.J. Abrams.</font>

481
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Mike, this new anthem
is said to have everything</font>

482
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">the old one had, but some
new surprises, as well.</font>

483
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:57,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have to be an absolute
asshole not to stand and support it.</font>

484
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is such a big night for America</font>

485
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">that both the presidential
candidates are here.</font>

486
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you can see the Turd Sandwich</font>

487
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">waving to all four
people excited by her,</font>

488
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there is the Giant
Douche doing the same.</font>

489
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I sit down to
not support this thing,</font>

490
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure to lose this election.</font>

491
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen...</font>

492
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is!</font>

493
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the anthem begins. Let's
hope this fixes America.</font>

494
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">For our national anthem,
we now ask you all</font>

495
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:23,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">in solidarity to please rise,</font>

496
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">or sit,</font>

497
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">or take a knee</font>

498
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to honor America.</font>

499
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait. Uh, wait, what? Wait?
♪ O say can you... ♪</font>

500
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely
shattered expectations, Mike!</font>

501
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, whether people are
standing, sitting, or kneeling,</font>

502
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are all honoring America.</font>

503
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">J.J. Abrams is a
wizard, Tom... A wizard!</font>

504
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">More people sitting now as
Abrams has made it irrelevant.</font>

505
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who saw this coming?</font>

506
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's the rest of the anthem,</font>

507
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the parts we remembered and loved.</font>

508
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">J.J. Abrams has fixed America.</font>

509
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:51,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! This was supposed to... oh!</font>

510
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:54,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez!</font>

511
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Kyle. You okay, son?</font>

512
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, dad. Just thinking.</font>

513
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:16,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'll be in my
office if you want to talk.</font>

514
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sync and corrections by Subban!</font>
