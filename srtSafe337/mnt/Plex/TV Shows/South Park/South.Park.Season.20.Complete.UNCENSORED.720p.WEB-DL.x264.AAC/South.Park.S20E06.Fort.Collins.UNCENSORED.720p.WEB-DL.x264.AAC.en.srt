<font color="#FFFFFF">Not every day you troll a whole country.</font>

40
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">We brought some beers.</font>

41
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a trolling party.</font>

42
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:16,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- We did it!</font>

43
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- We did it.</font>

44
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:19,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think if anything,</font>

45
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:22,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">we proved that trolls really
can have an effect on the world.</font>

46
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said it!
- Yeah! We're awesome.</font>

47
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:28,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think that on the next
one, we're only gonna get better.</font>

48
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">No doubt about it.</font>

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-What are you talking about, next one?</font>

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Skankhunt, we got an entire country</font>

51
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:37,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sign off social media and
stop what they were doing.</font>

52
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:40,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine what effect we can
have on the rest of the world.</font>

53
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:42,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're like super trolls
who can change anything.</font>

54
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I talk to you for second?</font>

55
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you bring them here?</font>

56
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean? We're all
on a team now, Skankhunt.</font>

57
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was one-time deal so
nobody would find out who we are.</font>

58
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you saw what we did
when we worked together.</font>

59
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just think about what we could do to,</font>

60
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:01,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">like, the presidential election.</font>

61
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">The election?</font>

62
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:04,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a shit about the election.</font>

63
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't troll to be political.</font>

64
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it's political.</font>

65
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:11,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I just do it to laugh...
Like I did when I was a kid.</font>

66
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you remember being a kid</font>

67
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just calling someone
a fag for no reason?</font>

68
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember being called
a fag for no reason.</font>

69
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right! Like, it was just fun, right?</font>

70
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:24,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting political doesn't
do anything for me.</font>

71
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just like remembering
when I was a kid.</font>

72
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

73
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:28,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to get those people to go,</font>

74
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then you need to go.</font>

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

76
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, Skankhunt.</font>

154
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:32,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna seem a
little weird to you, okay?</font>

155
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

156
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I quit Twitter
and threw my phone away,</font>

157
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:38,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to prove who our
school message board troll was.</font>

158
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you said you would do, Kyle,</font>

159
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">except that she actually meant it.</font>

160
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:44,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I stopped searching,
I learned something.</font>

161
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look.</font>

162
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is all this?</font>

163
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:52,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">To try and prove who the troll was,</font>

164
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I started to look for patterns
in how students used Emojis.</font>

165
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I cross-referenced that
with the troll's writing.</font>

166
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call it Emoji Analysis.</font>

167
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">People can hide behind a fake name,</font>

168
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the way they use
Emojis gives them away.</font>

169
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that's pretty smart.</font>

170
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's funny, too, Kyle.</font>

171
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">After I had eliminated
nearly every student,</font>

172
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:10,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I started to realize
that the troll's Emojis</font>

173
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">were more archaic and less
elegant than the average kid's.</font>

174
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I realized it.</font>

175
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever Skankhunt42 is on
the school message boards,</font>

176
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">it isn't a student.</font>

177
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an adult.</font>

178
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:23,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean like one of the teachers?</font>

179
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think... it's one of the parents.</font>

180
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

181
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:31,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had enough examples of the teachers'
text and e-mails to do Emoji analysis.</font>

182
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were much more in
line with Skankhunt's</font>

183
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">but still not a match.</font>

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Emoji analysis... It's genius.</font>

185
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:41,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not giving her
credit for being hilarious.</font>

186
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:46,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ching Chong ching loo is Die ♪</font>

187
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,162

188
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,432

<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Ching Chong ching loo is Die ♪</font>

191
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, take a look at the
statistical analysis.</font>

192
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">The servers are working.</font>

193
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then we don't need any more funding?</font>

194
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.</font>

195
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using Heidi's Emoji analysis,</font>

196
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have the final piece of the puzzle.</font>

197
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, we have narrowed
down the location</font>

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the troll attack on Denmark.</font>

199
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:23,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a location in the
middle of the United States,</font>

200
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">a place they call Coloreedo.</font>

201
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coloreedo?</font>

202
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:29,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a very goofy name.</font>

203
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe that very soon
the servers will give us</font>

204
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:35,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">the place in Coloreedo that
the trolling originated.</font>

205
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on and hide in your
cave, little troll.</font>

206
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:47,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon, everyone will know where you live.</font>

207
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:51,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow, ow, ow!</font>

208
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:52,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

209
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing kills these things.</font>

210
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to keep trying.</font>

211
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd they go?</font>

212
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not in the jar?</font>

213
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

214
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:01,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's over.</font>

215
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'll go find more.</font>

216
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over, don't you get it?</font>

217
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if we found a way
to eradicate them now,</font>

218
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">we don't have time to
implement it nationwide.</font>

219
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then how do we stop them from
getting me elected President?</font>

220
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:16,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison.</font>

221
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">The American people have
to be made to understand</font>

222
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's going on here.</font>

223
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:22,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to have to talk to them.</font>

224
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I am done giving
political speeches.</font>

225
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried being dirty.
I tried being vulgar.</font>

226
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:29,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing mattered.</font>

227
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time ever,</font>

228
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna have to
speak from the heart</font>

229
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not make it about you.</font>

230
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's just impossible.</font>

231
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what these
things are capable of.</font>

232
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you lose the election,</font>

233
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">another one like you is gonna
rise up and take your place.</font>

234
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">J.J. Abrams has seen to that.</font>

235
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:48,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it, Randy?</font>

236
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a politician.</font>

237
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never was.</font>

238
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that for
the future of our country,</font>

239
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:57,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna have to
give one last speech...</font>

240
00:09:57,234 --> 00:10:00,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">The speech that everyone needs to hear,</font>

241
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:04,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">a speech where you finally just
talk like a normal human being.</font>

242
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez.</font>

243
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man. Can we have
a quick chin wiggle?</font>

244
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the other day, when
you said Heidi wasn't funny,</font>

245
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was pretty lame, man.</font>

246
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't being funny.</font>

247
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:24,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Will you let it go!</font>

248
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have to have
this hang-up against women?</font>

249
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't!
- You do, Kyle!</font>

250
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to think about
the things you say.</font>

251
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">They matter!</font>

252
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman.</font>

253
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did some research on the Danish
website you've been helping out.</font>

254
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:38,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do realize that once
Troll Trace is online,</font>

255
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">anybody can use it on anyone, right?</font>

256
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, to catch trolls.</font>

257
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, somebody like Heidi could use it</font>

258
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">to see your entire Internet history,</font>

259
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything you ever said
and did on the Internet,</font>

260
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">even before you were together.</font>

261
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Heidi actually
doesn't use the Internet.</font>

262
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've sworn off that
stuff, so it's cool.</font>

263
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. But somebody like me</font>

264
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">could look up your
entire Internet history,</font>

265
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">print it out, and give it to Heidi.</font>

266
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would imagine there are some things
you've done or said on the Internet</font>

267
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.</font>

268
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

269
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you like the movie, hon?</font>

270
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it sucked!</font>

271
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:31,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna send Butters
an e-mail right now.</font>

272
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dude, don't bother
with new 'Ghostbusters.'</font>

274
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:37,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get ice cream now?</font>

275
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:40,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to get the taste
of ass out of my mouth.</font>

276
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:51,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can they make what
I said on the Internet</font>

277
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">available to the
public? That's bullshit!</font>

278
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:54,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's available to everyone, stupid!</font>

279
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,051

280
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,427

to keep up, 'member?</font>
