00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:09,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know if they have anything
at this store for a dry dick?</font>

151
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

152
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:11,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

153
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can't
think of anything?</font>

154
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know.</font>

155
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:20,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Eduardo Hernandez?</font>

156
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it was Eduardo
who told me</font>

157
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't double-bag
my groceries</font>

158
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though he's from
fucking Guatemala.</font>

159
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you
think now, Eduardo?</font>

160
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to double-bag
something else?</font>

161
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the President.</font>

162
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, we need you
at the Pentagon.</font>

163
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a matter
of national security.</font>

164
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

165
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kind of busy
right now, geez.</font>

166
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, the Danish have
released a statement.</font>

167
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid we may be
going to war.</font>

168
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">War?</font>

169
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,841
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yep. Copy that.</i></font>

170
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike! Ike, buddy,
can you hear me?</font>

171
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you
to do something, okay?</font>

172
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy needs your help.</font>

173
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to go to your browser</font>

174
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sign on to the school
message board, okay?</font>

175
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do that for me?</font>

176
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">The school message board
and then log in.</font>

177
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lower-case "s,"skankhunt42."</font>

178
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it?</font>

179
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:15,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

180
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, what?</font>

181
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna have his son
sign in and troll for him.</font>

182
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Skankhunt is still
out there trolling,</font>

183
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">then they have
the wrong guy, get it?</font>

184
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called
using your brain, fatso!</font>

185
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, they'll
blame your kid?</font>

186
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares
if a kid trolls.</font>

187
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they gonna do?
Get a slap on the wrist?</font>

188
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you hear
what that guy said?</font>

189
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna set countries
against each other.</font>

190
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have
way bigger problems.</font>

191
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
my fucking wife.</font>

192
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, you got it?</font>

193
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, pal.</font>

194
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now I need you to go to
the comments section, okay,</font>

195
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:48,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">and type in "You should
all get raped by gorillas."</font>

196
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got that, pal?</font>

197
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, "You should
all get raped by gorillas."</font>

198
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, we have
a lot work to do here.</font>

199
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, I didn't
think getting to Mars</font>

200
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">would take this long.</font>

201
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think that this is
what we should do, babe?</font>

202
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna miss everyone.</font>

203
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
But it'll be worth it, babe.</font>

204
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be left alone
to make our new world better.</font>

205
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Eric!</font>

206
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you doing here?</font>

207
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I want to get
the fuck off this planet,</font>

208
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they told me
I had to take a number.</font>

209
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no,
you're a male chauvinist</font>

210
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">sexist pig, Butters.
You don't get to go to Mars.</font>

211
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't understand.
I've see the light.</font>

212
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:22,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a changed man.</font>

213
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought boys
were being treated unfairly,</font>

214
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now I know</font>

215
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">shit's about
to get a lot worse.</font>

216
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are.</font>

217
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah! I 'member.</font>

218
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everybody,
'member?</font>

219
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 'Member snowspeeders?

226
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, I 'member.</font>

227
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now make sure the little
worm is in the woman's mouth.</font>

228
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:17,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it?</font>

229
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:22,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I need you to type "You're
a fat retard" in the comments.</font>

230
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You're a retard."</font>

231
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you have to say
"a<i> fat</i> retard," Ike!</font>

232
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a nuance,
but it's very important!</font>

233
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You are a fat wee-tard."</font>

234
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike!</font>

235
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

236
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">What he says.</font>

237
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was you
all this time!</font>

238
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done, Ike?</font>

239
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
the damage you've caused?</font>

240
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can my child
be such a monster?</font>

241
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, hello.</font>

242
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sweetheart.
How's everything going?</font>

243
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to come home from
helping the government, Gerald.</font>

244
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just caught Ike
trolling Mrs. Hererra.</font>

245
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious?</font>

246
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! The school troll is
our son, Gerald!</font>

247
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see all the things
he's posted on his computer!</font>

248
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">God dang it!</font>

249
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:12,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me talk to him right now.</font>

250
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

251
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ike, just stay calm
and act like I'm yelling at you,</font>

252
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">okay, pal?</font>

253
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, give it a few seconds.</font>

254
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

255
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Okay, now — now say,
"I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

256
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm just
fucked up inside."</font>

257
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

258
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, you have
to listen to me.</font>

259
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your mother's life, this is
a matter of national security.</font>

260
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to say,
"I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

261
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm just
fucked up inside."</font>

262
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm just fucked up inside.</font>

263
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was amazing, kiddo.
It'll all be worth it, okay?</font>

264
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:45,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make this up to you.
Give me back to your mom.</font>

265
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald?</font>

266
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's full of shit.</font>

267
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not sorry.
If he felt sorry,</font>

268
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wouldn't be able
to do it in the first place.</font>

269
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:52,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know!</font>

270
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get home
as soon as I can</font>

271
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deal with this, okay?</font>

272
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can deal with this together.</font>

273
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't say anything
to anyone for now, all right?</font>

274
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

275
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, yeah,
I love you, too.</font>

276
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. Bye.</font>

277
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just sit in here until
we figure out what to do.</font>

278
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you get back on
that computer, you are done!</font>

279
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it?</font>

280
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, okay, there's just
a few more things</font>

281
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:17,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to do.</font>

282
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:22,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to type
"How'd you like a donkey dick?"</font>

283
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to
the Pentagon, sir.</font>

284
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been ordered
to show you around.</font>

285
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, please.</font>

286
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I can do whatever
the fuck I want</font>

287
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">in here now, right?</font>

288
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. Here are
all our military secrets</font>

289
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all classified
information.</font>

290
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, good.</font>

291
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is
the drone program.</font>

292
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there, you can kill
anyone on earth remotely.</font>

293
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the keys.</font>

294
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

295
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">In here is
satellite surveillance</font>

296
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you can monitor
anyone's conversation live.</font>

297
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,108

<font color="#FFFFFF">than a Pizza Pocket.</font>

460
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going to Mars is gonna take
a lot of very smart people</font>

00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure if you know
our friend, Heidi.</font>

'member?</font>

476
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">We decided
he's in charge.</font>

477
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we said I'm
in charge, 'member?</font>

487
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

488
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk to him!
He is in big trouble!</font>

489
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd he do?</font>

490
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him, Kyle!</font>

491
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother is
the Internet troll</font>

492
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's caused all this pain
in our community.</font>

493
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
It was him all along.</font>

494
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we have to figure out
what to tell people</font>

495
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:12,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they learn this ugliness
came from our family.</font>

quit Twitter?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You</i> started a war
between boys and girls?</font>

498

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't a student,
it's an adult.</font>

501
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ugliness came
from our family.</font>

502
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:30,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
it's one of the parents.</font>

503
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to just laugh
and make fun of shit.</font>

504
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy called you
a pussy.</font>

505
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

506
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

507
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, come on!</font>

508
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle?</font>

509
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike?</font>

510
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what, whaaat?</font>

511
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look — Whenever I don't know
what people are talking about,</font>

512
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can just do this.
Wait, look — do this.</font>

513
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is —
This is my stank face.</font>

514
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I'm not listening
to you, see?</font>

515
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did a really good job
on my stank lips.</font>

516
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an
amazing transition.</font>
