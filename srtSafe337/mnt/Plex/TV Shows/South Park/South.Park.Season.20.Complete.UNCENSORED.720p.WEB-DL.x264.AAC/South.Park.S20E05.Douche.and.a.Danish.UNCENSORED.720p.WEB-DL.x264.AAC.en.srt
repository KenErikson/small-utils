nervous for your speech.</font>

38
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know we're down a bit in the polls,</font>

39
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,677

we can win the swing states.</font>

41
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:40,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one thing, sir.</font>

42
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be a little careful
what you say about women.</font>

43
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,736

be losing us some votes.</font>

00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

46
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">our country is divided
like never before,</font>

47
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we all know that only
one man has the guts to say</font>

48
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we're all thinking.</font>

49
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,535

man who, with your help,</font>

50
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:04,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">will soon be the next
President of the United States!</font>

52
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,879

Douche, Douche, Douche, Douche.</font>

53
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

54
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm standing in line at the airport,</font>

55
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting in security 'cause
of all the freakin' Muslims...</font>

56
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

57
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the TSA security people all look
like black thugs from the inner city.</font>

58
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like, "Oh, good,
you're gonna protect us?"</font>

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe it's good
they're all gang members.</font>

60
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least they can tell the difference</font>

61
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">between Muslims and Mexicans
'cause God knows I can't.</font>

62
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'm standing there
in line and you know what I do?</font>

63
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:46,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stick my finger in
this chick's asshole.</font>

64
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">She turns to me and says,</font>

65
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, aren't you that guy
that's running for president?"</font>

66
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say, "Yeah."</font>

67
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:58,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says, "Why you got
your finger in my ass?"</font>

68
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "I'm just
keeping it warm, honey,</font>

69
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause that chick next
to you is way hotter,</font>

70
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna stick it in her clam."</font>

71
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Let's make American great again.</font>

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">No dude wants his finger
in some ugly bitch's ass.</font>

73
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to be careful, though. It's
only about half-an-inch away, you know,</font>

74
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:18,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">the asshole and that clam, so you
got to be careful. Right, dudes?</font>

75
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh, where you going?</font>

76
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You leaving?</font>

77
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Did I offend you?</font>

78
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did I lose you, honey?</font>

79
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you've been okay with
the fuck everyone to death,</font>

80
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the Muslim and Mexican shit,</font>

81
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">but fingers in the ass did it for you?</font>

82
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Just wanted to
see where your line was.</font>

83
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, look, I guess
some more broads are leaving.</font>

84
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:38,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez. You were so on board.</font>

85
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I let that
little offensive mark slip!</font>

86
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor girls. Did you
get your feelings hurt</font>

87
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">after cheering for "fuck
all the immigrants?"</font>

88
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez. I'm sorry. Geez.</font>

89
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

90
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you tired of hate speech?</font>

91
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sick of sexism and the bigotry?</font>

92
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then please help the
Danish put an end to trolls.</font>

93
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, the people of Denmark</font>

94
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">are working on a biometric
computer superstructure</font>

95
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">which will allow people
all around the world</font>

96
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">to identify the trolls
in their communities.</font>

97
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to make this dream into a reality,</font>

98
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">we still need your donations.</font>

99
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are just a few million Kroners away,</font>

100
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:27,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">so please donate via the
social media of your choice.</font>

101
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just imagine it.</font>

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowing who said what on the Internet.</font>

103
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world will
be peaceful and happy.</font>

104
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like here in Denmark!</font>

105
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help fund our project
on social media today!</font>

106
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:46,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together we will rid
the world of trolls!</font>

107
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:58,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellow trolls, we have gathered together</font>

108
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">because our anonymity
is being threatened.</font>

109
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Individually, we are some of the
most notorious trolls in Colorado.</font>

110
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must now find a way to unite.</font>

111
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:14,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one of us has the power to
make message boards go haywire,</font>

112
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">the power to make
individuals buckle and fall.</font>

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine if we use those
skills against a common enemy.</font>

114
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have an entire
government at their disposal.</font>

115
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have Skankhunt42.</font>

116
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Gerald, all right?</font>

117
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:35,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that he is the
key to stopping all this.</font>

118
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone, listen up.</font>

119
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">This school is falling
apart and it needs to stop.</font>

120
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys are harassing girls</font>

121
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">and girls are
stereotyping all boys as...</font>

122
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:46,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!</font>

123
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

124
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I've asked for some ideas,</font>

125
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a couple of students
want to try and help.</font>

126
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please welcome Heidi and Eric.</font>

127
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys!</font>

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?</font>

129
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, we have a lot of
problems facing our school.</font>

130
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if many of you know Heidi,</font>

131
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she is really
smart and really funny.</font>

132
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop, Eric.
- You are.</font>

133
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's come up with
a pretty cool idea.</font>

134
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell 'em, baby.
- Thanks, babe.</font>

135
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you guys
have heard, but right now,</font>

136
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Denmark is trying to make
trolling a thing of the past.</font>

137
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're asking for help, and I
thought "Why not a school fundraiser?"</font>

138
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but the way you said it was
actually way funnier, remember?</font>

139
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? How did I say it?
- Remember? You were like,</font>

140
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, what if we had a fundraiser in..."
What was it? Remember? It was like...</font>

141
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was this? Were we at Denny's?</font>

142
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we were having that
dessert thing. What was that?</font>

143
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:29,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right, and you kept
spilling it and everything.</font>

144
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. Remember there
was that guy that had the...</font>

145
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had that weird haircut and you
kept saying that it looked like</font>

146
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:37,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">- he had a dick on his head.
- Yeah, yeah. And you said that...</font>

147
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, guys. W-What's up?</font>

148
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right! A school fundraiser.</font>

149
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, we'll be going
to each individual class</font>

150
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">with more information.</font>

151
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:55,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after that...</font>

152
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we should all come together.</font>

153
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a school.</font>

154
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:05,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, what were you thinking?</font>

155
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">We said to be careful how
you talked about women!</font>

156
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I don't know.</font>

157
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I just kind of
screwed the pooch on that one.</font>

158
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are way down in the polls!</font>

159
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how we recover from this!</font>

160
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really? Geez, that's too bad.</font>

161
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:20,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of us have staked
our lives on backing you!</font>

162
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just go bonkers like this!</font>

163
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sorry, I didn't
realize women were racists.</font>

164
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have millions of supporters
who are looking to you to lead.</font>

165
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna want to know
what you're gonna do about this!</font>

166
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I don't know. Nothing. Whatever.</font>

167
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:35,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to tell them that?</font>

168
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're outside.</font>

169
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

170
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

171
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:46,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, everybody.</font>

172
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... yeah, looks like
we're tanking in the polls.</font>

173
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what?</font>

174
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fixed.</font>

175
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never gonna win
in the first place.</font>

176
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it from the beginning.</font>

177
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:00,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on November 8th,</font>

178
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:01,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I lose,</font>

179
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be able to say "I told you so!"</font>

180
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">This sum'ma bitch
pulled a fast one on us!</font>

181
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like he's not even trying!</font>

182
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. I'm trying. I just...</font>

183
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

184
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

185
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez!</font>

186
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill him!
- Tear his head off!</font>

187
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let him get away!</font>

188
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yee-haw!</font>

189
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want? Go away!</font>

190
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Just checking to see if you needed</font>

191
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">any more refreshments
for the conference room.</font>

192
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're fine. We don't need anything.</font>

193
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some more creamer!</font>

194
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just some more creamer.</font>

195
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Well, I just wanted
to say thanks for choosing...</font>

196
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're clear again.</font>

197
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were saying, Skankhunt?</font>

198
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look. How
do you troll somebody?</font>

199
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:05,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say really fucked up shit and
make them quit social media?</font>

200
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. It's not about one person.</font>

201
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about pushing people's buttons</font>

202
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that they'll react in a way</font>

203
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">that pushes other people's buttons!</font>

204
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you don't just</font>

205
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">troll a woman with cancer
to get a reaction from her.</font>

206
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all about the group of people
that are gonna come to her defense!</font>

207
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna be so self-righteous</font>

208
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">that another group of people will eventually
find those people totally annoying!</font>

209
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just setting
them against each other.</font>

210
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like the fission reaction</font>

211
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">that sets off the fusion explosion!</font>

212
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Internet does it all,</font>

213
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you just sit back with
your glass of wine and laugh!</font>

214
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. That seems kind of mean.</font>

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not mean if it's hilarious!</font>

216
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we all worked with
you, Skank, could we do it?</font>

217
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could we troll an entire country?</font>

218
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we all work together?</font>

219
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

220
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

221
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys!</font>

222
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we're gonna start
our school fundraiser.</font>

223
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an idea I came up with
called Danishes for Denmark.</font>

224
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's awesome. You're doing awesome!</font>

225
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need everyone to do their part,</font>

226
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:16,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">so later on in the cafeteria,
we are all gonna need...</font>

227
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, children. Let's take our seats.</font>

228
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:23,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's, uh, get back our
lessons on grammar, shall we?</font>

229
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:24,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Garrison?</font>

230
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, does anybody, uh,
remember where we left off?</font>

231
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? All right, who can tell
me what an adjective is?</font>

232
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. You can go now. I'm back.</font>

233
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who can... Who can tell
me what an adjective is?</font>

234
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, aren't you running for president?</font>

235
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adjectives usually come before what?</font>

236
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">They come before nouns. That's right.</font>

237
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Garrison.</font>

238
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just act
like nothing happened.</font>

239
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're spiraling out of control</font>

240
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:46,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you have to answer to the people!</font>

241
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you're
talking about. I am a teacher.</font>

242
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, adjectives describe nouns,</font>

243
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and there are several types of them...
- Mr. Garrison.</font>

244
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are some examples of
adjectives you can give me</font>

245
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">for this sentence? Anybody?</font>

246
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison,</font>

247
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you have to make good on it!</font>

248
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">The yellow ball! That's a good one.</font>

249
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we can say "the
slippery ball," can't we?</font>

250
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- What else about the ball?</font>

251
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please. What else can we
say about the ball, children?</font>

252
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please! Leave me alone!</font>

253
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The bouncy ball!
- No!</font>

254
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not going back! Please!</font>

255
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna kill me! Children!</font>

256
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me, children! Help me!</font>

257
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on. Office is upstairs.</font>

258
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Hi, honey.</font>

259
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald, you're back
from your convention?</font>

260
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It went really well.</font>

261
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is, uh, my I.T. guy.</font>

262
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:29,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna help me get my
office computer set back up.</font>

263
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can I make you
guys something to eat?</font>

264
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about us,
hon. Lots of work to do.</font>

265
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love you so much!</font>

266
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, no Internet tonight.</font>

267
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need all the bandwidth we can get.</font>

268
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.</font>

269
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

270
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to hand it to you, Gerald.</font>

271
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a really nice
home. A nice family.</font>

272
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, now you see I have a lot
to lose if they find out who I am.</font>

273
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:54,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who is that?</font>

274
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:56,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

275
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've studied your work.</font>

276
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so good at
lashing out at the system,</font>

277
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">bringing people down
off their high horses.</font>

278
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you do it?</font>

279
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you. It's just funny to me.</font>

280
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do it for the lolz.</font>

281
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe that.</font>

282
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's more to Skankhunt.</font>

283
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was in school,</font>

284
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">kids teased me,</font>

285
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">called me a midget even though I'm not.</font>

286
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother was a little person,</font>

287
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:24,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she actually married a
guy who had gigantism syndrome.</font>

288
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">She thought if she was a little person</font>

289
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">and had a baby with a giant,</font>

290
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would come out normal.</font>

291
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:37,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't let these Danish pricks</font>

292
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">take away our online lives, Skank.</font>

293
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some of us, it's all we have.</font>

294
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Let's come together as a school ♪</font>

295
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,338

good as everyone thought it was.</font>

446
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:43,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may seem fun to go back
and recycle the past we loved.</font>

447
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:46,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we end up with no sustenance.</font>

448
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:47,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were gonna explain</font>

449
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">why people want a guy
like me to be president.</font>

450
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's important, too, I guess,</font>

451
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:54,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's just a symptom
of the same thing.</font>

452
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:57,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, when a civilization
has become so big,</font>

453
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">it starts to get lazy,</font>

454
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's when you get Memberberries.</font>

455
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're nothing new.</font>

456
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:06,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">They date back all the
way to the Roman Empire.</font>

457
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once too many Romans
ate the Memberberries,</font>

458
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was no more growth.</font>

459
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:11,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">They rested on their laurels,</font>

460
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">just eating and 'membering
all the good stuff.</font>

461
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think those are just grapes.</font>

462
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:18,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought so, too, till I zoomed in.</font>

463
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Member?</font>

464
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:22,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, we all want to go
back to when we were kids.</font>

465
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:26,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple ideas like a big man
to protect us, keep us safe.</font>

466
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:30,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead of a fresh, new
"Star Wars," we want the old,</font>

467
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:33,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">just recycled and
plopped in our tummies.</font>

468
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You almost make it sound like</font>

469
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">J.J. Abrams is responsible
for this entire election.</font>

470
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:40,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does this look familiar?</font>

471
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez.</font>

472
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir! We've got a message from overseas.</font>

473
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:55,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really should see it.</font>

474
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">A message how?</font>

475
00:20:57,158 --> 00:20:58,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're completely offline.</font>

476
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was sent on a VHS.</font>

477
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:03,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever sent it is
completely offline, too.</font>

478
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it on the screen.</font>

479
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Denmark,</font>

480
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">we know that you've been
the victim of trolling.</font>

481
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:13,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">So have we.</font>

482
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we can help.</font>

483
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure if you know
my girlfriend, Heidi,</font>

484
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she's really smart and really funny.</font>

485
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:20,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it. No, I'm not.</font>

486
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are, babe. Stop it.</font>

487
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are these people?</font>

488
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:24,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just listen.</font>

489
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.</font>

490
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea.</font>

491
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:32,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to figure out the
source of who trolled you last night.</font>

492
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:34,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get everyone back inside.</font>

493
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this girl really is
that smart and funny,</font>

494
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:39,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">we might have another shot here.</font>
