Freja Ollengaurd.</font>

12
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freja, you've talked about
being trolled on the Internet</font>

13
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">and its consequences.
Yes, Heidi.</font>

14
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe trolling has a tragic
effect on innocent people.</font>

15
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been the victim of
horrific, degrading attacks</font>

17
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:04,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice.</font>

18
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tried to just
ignore the trolls,</font>

19
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that only seems to
make them attack me more.</font>

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be
so awful for you to</font>

21
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">create a website

28
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been overwhelming.</font>

29
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,194

your website is saving lives.</font>

31

from a physician in Spain.</font>

You're doing great things.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an inspiration."</font>

39
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's from Hungarian physician
Dr. Courtsier Boobsoff.</font>

00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the three-point line!</font>

Am I missing something?</font>

00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

44
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, sir. We're conducting
an investigation.</font>

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... regarding?</font>

46
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, regarding what?</font>

47
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you happen to know
this child?</font>

48
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Sure.</font>

49
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of
my son's friends.</font>

50
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm afraid
he's quit Twitter.</font>

51
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Another one, huh?</font>

52
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
but this one's different.</font>

53
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">The events surrounding
his quitting Twitter</font>

54
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">were very suspicious.</font>

55
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most people that quit Twitter
leave at least three paragraphs</font>

56
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">stating that
they're quitting Twitter</font>

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they quit
Twitter.</font>

58
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">This child
just stopped using it.</font>

59
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle!</font>

60
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're simply trying to
gather information</font>

61
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">on whether was a Twitter suicide
or Twitter homicide.</font>

62
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, have you seen
your friend Eric online?</font>

63
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Uh, he quit.</font>

64
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you happen to know why,
son?</font>

65
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">He probably got fed up with
all the negativity</font>

66
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and decided to end it.
I don't know.</font>

67
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without tweeting
a goodbye?</font>

68
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't just
quit social media.</font>

69
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">They post long, drawn-out
messages on social media</font>

70
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">explaining why they're leaving
social media.</font>

71
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, officers,
why don't you just</font>

72
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">go ask him
why he quit Twitter?</font>

73
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">At where, sir?</font>

74
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">At where?</font>

75
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that was the cops.
The cops were here.</font>

76
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cops? For what?</font>

77
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know for what!
You know what we did to Cartman!</font>

78
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We did what we had to do.
- But we were wrong!</font>

79
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the police
we have to worry about.</font>

80
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Eric.</font>

81
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna get us.</font>

82
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellas, we all
just have to stay cool, okay?</font>

83
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.
He's coming.</font>

84
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna get us.</font>

85
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan.</font>

86
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just
stay in your room all day.</font>

87
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened, Dad?</font>

88
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's upside-down.</font>

89
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:05,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's taking sides
and splitting into groups.</font>

90
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything sucks.</font>

91
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah,
everything sucks.</font>

92
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's divided.</font>

93
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's getting along.</font>

94
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's people
like your mother</font>

95
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">who are thinking about
voting for a douche</font>

96

<font color="#FFFFFF">More and more are agreeing
with your mother.</font>

100
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried getting on
community message boards</font>

101
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">and swaying people's minds,</font>

102
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it always ends up with some
asshole talking about vaginas</font>

103
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">and photoshopping
a dick in my mouth.</font>

105
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything sucks.</font>

106
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,951

for the debates, ma'am.</font>

107
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,254

<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let him rattle you.</font>

109
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna do whatever he can to
try and mess with your head.</font>

110
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't buy into it.</font>

111
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,627

just respond with</font>

113
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,067

let's get right into it.</font>

117
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our first question is for you,
sir.</font>

118
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will you deal with
ground troops in Syria?</font>

119
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, I need to just
speak from the heart here.</font>

120
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't know what
the fuck I'm doing.</font>

121
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got to come clean.</font>

122
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I had no idea
I would get this far,</font>

123
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the fact of the matter is,
I should not be president.</font>

124
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? I will fuck this country
up beyond repair.</font>

125
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,202

about the future of our country,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">vote for her, okay?</font>

128
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the one who at least
has some experience.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">because it's very weird
and her advisors probably —</font>

150
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">My opponent is a liar
and cannot be trusted.</font>

151
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.
Oh, fuck.</font>

152
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the fuck
did it have to be her?</font>

153
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so fucked.</font>

154
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, boys. I've had just
about enough of playing games.</font>

155
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The four of you were
good friends with Eric Cartman,</font>

156
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet none of you seem to know
why he left social media.</font>

157
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's got anything to say?</font>

158
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have a theory.</font>

159
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that Eric Cartman</font>

160
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">was somehow forced to leave
social media as a retaliation</font>

161
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Heidi Turner
quitting social media!</font>

162
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, because of the actions</font>

163
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">of one sexist, bigoted,
racist troll...</font>

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

165
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have a gender war
on our hands.</font>

166
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make no mistake, gentlemen.</font>

167
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our community is under attack.</font>

168
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we don't
get to the bottom of it,</font>

169
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's gonna be more students
like Eric Cartman</font>

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">wandering the hallways</font>

171
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no connection

<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi Turner?</font>

175
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

176
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

177
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Join us. Here.</font>

178
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">The park?</font>

179
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how you feel, Eric.</font>

180
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how hard it is
when school gets out.</font>

181
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">With no phone.</font>

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No human contact.</font>

183
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:07,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I m-miss my stuff!</font>

184
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:11,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
There are others like us here.</font>

185
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at them, Martha.</font>

186
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see them?</font>

187
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they?</font>

188
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lost souls who have
quit Twitter.</font>

189
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damned to just wander the earth
and hang out and stuff.</font>

190
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">They seem so lonely.</font>

191
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

192
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is wrong
with you people?</font>

193
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just saw a new poll that says
more and more of you</font>

194
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">are thinking about
voting for that douche!</font>

195
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us are.</font>

196
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of people like
what he has to say, all right?</font>

197
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me
that after that debate,</font>

198
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">you still want to
vote for that guy?</font>

199
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than ever.</font>

200
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

201
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see
the same debates I saw?</font>

202
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it, Randy?</font>

203
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's people in this country
who are sick and tired.</font>

204
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tired of hearing
all the rhetoric.</font>

205
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tired of Washington failing us
while they pat their own backs.</font>

206
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, someone comes along
who says what he feels.</font>

207
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why people like him.</font>

208
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because,
say what you want,</font>

209
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:18,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">at least he doesn't sound like
another politician.</font>

210
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">America, please listen to me.</font>

211
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea
how to be president.</font>

212
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a complete jackass</font>

213
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have
made a giant mistake here.</font>

214
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.</font>

215
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you clapping?</font>

216
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not a good person
for the White House.</font>

217
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not a good person period!</font>

218
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, someone who doesn't
talk like a politician!</font>

219
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am peeing my pants</font>

220
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the thought of
being president, okay?</font>

221
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, shut up!
Listen to me!</font>

222
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want a guy like me
in the White House!</font>

223
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even want to know
the shit I've done.</font>

224
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo-hoo!</font>

225
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have scissored with another
woman when I had a sex change!</font>

226
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's so honest!</font>

227
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no!</font>

228
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the guy you want
going to Russia</font>

229
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">to negotiate with Putin!</font>

230
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll probably end up
getting drunk</font>

231
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">and trying to suck his dick!</font>

232
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez!</font>

233
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike, got a minute?</font>

234
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk, buddy.</font>

235
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the school
really wants us to</font>

236
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep talking to our kids about
trolling on the Internet</font>

237
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how serious it is.</font>

238
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the troll from
the school message boards</font>

239
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">is now harassing a famous
Olympic athlete from Denmark.</font>

240
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you seen this?
Have you heard about this?</font>

241
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, she kind of
called him out</font>

242
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">and said he could never
get her to quit social media,</font>

243
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you know, you might say
she's asking for it.</font>

244
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, uh, now this troll
is being copied by other trolls</font>

245
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">who are all dog-piling to see if
they can get her to quit,</font>

246
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, well, God only knows
what they're gonna do tonight.</font>

247
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, see ya, pal.</font>

248
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">You be sure to let your mom know
we talked more about</font>

249
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">the horrific consequences
of trolling.</font>

250
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to tell you
that I'm sorry.</font>

251
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

252
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">When women first started
getting trolled</font>

253
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the school message boards,
I was sure it was you.</font>

254
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong.</font>

255
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't the only one.</font>

256
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I didn't deserve
a second chance.</font>

257
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really tried
to make changes.</font>

258
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really tried
to become a better person.</font>

259
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">To show that
I was trying to listen.</font>

260
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">So,
when you held the assembly</font>

261
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">that women were
just as funny as men,</font>

262
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">you — you weren't
being sarcastic?</font>

263
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women are funny, Heidi.</font>

264
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get over it.</font>

265
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time Amy Schumer talks
about her vagina,</font>

266
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lose my fucking mind.</font>

267
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you miss your friends?</font>

268
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have any friends.</font>

269
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
if I ever did.</font>

270
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do now.</font>

271
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

272
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Florida.</font>

275
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,283

276
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

277
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,952

356

<font color="#FFFFFF">we must rise

into our village</font>

358
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">and taken from us
a beloved princess.</font>

359
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">He then returned to
his secret hiding place,</font>

360
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">crawled back to his little cave,</font>

361
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,488

364
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that we have been planning
our own attack.</font>

365
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am announcing here
and to the world</font>

366
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a plan to destroy the troll
is underway.</font>

367
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">For in Denmark,</font>

368
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is one thing we have known
for centuries —</font>

369
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get a troll
to come out of hiding,</font>

370
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:54,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must say its name.</font>

371
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

372
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

373
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking again...</font>

374
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how women are
just as funny as men.</font>

375
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:17,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I realized that
the only way to really be sure</font>

376
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to see if African-Americans
think they're funny.</font>

377
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that?</font>

378
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because
black laughs matter.</font>

379
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a joke?</font>

380
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

381
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

382
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you do.</font>

383
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi,
does it ever get any easier,</font>

384
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">living in this world?</font>

385
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hardest part
is not having any followers.</font>

386
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to go places
just to show them where I was.</font>

387
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to go somewhere?</font>

388
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll follow you.</font>

389
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mornin'.
How can I help ya?</font>

390
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I had some questions
about, uh, memberberries.</font>

391
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Everyone wants
memberberries these days.</font>

392
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right over here.</font>

393
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know what makes them
so popular.</font>

394
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had to get rid of all my
pumpkins, my onions, my peppers</font>

395
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">just to make room
for more memberberries.</font>

396
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
There's this many?</font>

397
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!</font>

398
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protocol zero.
No evidence.</font>

399
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear history, e-mails,
delete, delete, delete, delete.</font>

400
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erase, erase, trash, trash.</font>

401
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Nancy Morris
today.</font>

402
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has a different hair color.
Again.</font>

403
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear she doesn't think
anyone even notices.</font>

404
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her natural hair color
must be clear.</font>

405
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our computer's broke.</font>

406
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

407
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">It broke,
and I had to throw it away.</font>

408
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought
if a computer isn't working,</font>

409
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">you try and get it fixed.</font>

410
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">No,
now you just throw it away.</font>

411
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had all my recipes</font>

412
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">on that FileMaker program
on your computer.</font>

413
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get us a new computer
tomorrow.</font>

414
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I can see if we can
pull your recipes up</font>

415
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Ike's computer,
and that way they —</font>

416
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike's computer!</font>

417
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

418
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, move, move!</font>

419
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">My computer is off the network,</font>

420
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">and — and this computer
didn't mirror that computer.</font>

421
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they did have
the same Time Machine schedule,</font>

422
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">so then would any of my files
be accessible?</font>

423
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because they didn't know
each other's IP addresses.</font>

424
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you can
access my e-mail account</font>

425
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">from this computer
through iCloud?</font>

426
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I go to iCloud, my e-mails
are deleted. Good.</font>

427
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except there's a new e-mail.
That shouldn't have come in.</font>

428
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would an e-mail to me have
come in if I deleted everything?</font>

429
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I know who you are."</font>

430
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?</font>

431
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who I am?</font>

432
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who I am,
Ike?</font>

433
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

434
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I want to, Dad.</font>

435
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like that, smartass!</font>

436
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delete. Delete the account,
not the e-mails.</font>

437
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Meet me under
the Freemont Bridge,</font>

438
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,955

439
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

440
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,965

441
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's the best, dude.
Try it.</font>

442
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.
That's really good.</font>

443
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,477

life isn't gonna be so bad.</font>

444
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

445
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,846
