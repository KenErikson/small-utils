00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:44,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Troll hunter:
long ago in the dim and frozen
lands of scandinavia,</font>

11
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:50,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were creatures who wreaked
havoc on humanity — the troll.</font>

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:56,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">They dwelled in rocks, in caves,
isolated from civilization.</font>

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">The creatures were ugly, fat,
and slow-witted.</font>

14
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:04,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">But some could also look
and behave like human beings.</font>

15
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">These were the most dangerous.</font>

16
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:15,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the creatures have returned.</font>

17
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:20,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time,
1,000 miles across the sea.</font>

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today the monsters believe
they can go undetected,</font>

19
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free to attack and then retreat
to the darkness.</font>

20
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:45,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in denmark, we have dealt
with the trolls before.</font>

21
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now,
we shall deal with them again.</font>

22
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:53,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, can I talk to you?</font>

23
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, kyle.</font>

24
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the girls at school
are really mad.</font>

25
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like
one guy gets online</font>

26
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">And says terrible things
about girls,</font>

27
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it reflects badly
on all of us.
Uh-huh.</font>

28
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's sad,
everyone's depressed,</font>

29
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">And nobody knows
how to move forward.
Good.</font>

30
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:07,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess
what I'm saying is</font>

31
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:11,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm starting to feel a lot
of guilt just for being a boy.</font>

32
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I not feel that?</font>

33
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, kyle,
I have to meet someone.</font>

34
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to your mother.
I love you.</font>

35
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been
a rough few weeks, baby.</font>

36
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls are still mad</font>

37
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">About being trolled
on the school message board,</font>

38
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parents are all freaking out
about the election,</font>

39
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let me tell you,
you're glad not to be living</font>

40
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this country
right now.</font>

41
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, I'm sorry,</font>

42
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I told you not to skype me
anymore, right?</font>

43
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, charlotte, I love you.
I need you.</font>

44
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't break up with me.</font>

45
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to stand
with my girlfriends.</font>

46
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my god.
I can't believe they got to you.</font>

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those slinky snakes
in the grass!</font>

48
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?
You know who!</font>

49
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girls at my school!</font>

50
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all broke up
with their boyfriends,</font>

51
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now they got you
to go along with them!</font>

52
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a time when women and
girls have to stand together.</font>

53
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then it's true!</font>

54
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:55,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all snakes in the
grass — every last one of you!</font>

55
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, charlotte?</font>

56
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you there?
Honey?</font>

57
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
why you're harassing me.</font>

58
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even
own a computer.</font>

59
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is dick.</font>

60
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you with the nsa
or homeland security?</font>

61
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm a colleague.</font>

62
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">A colleague?</font>

63
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably know me
as dildo shwaggins.</font>

64
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dildo shwaggins
from pussystormers. Org?</font>

65
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk.
You're just a troll?</font>

66
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank god!</font>

67
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the same team,
skankhunt.</font>

68
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. That means I went
protocol zero for nothing.</font>

69
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

70
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's protocol zero?</font>

71
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's gone.</font>

72
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I destroyed my computers,
my phone.</font>

73
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why couldn't you just say,
"I know who you are.</font>

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a troll, too."</font>

75
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you have to be
so fucking cryptic?</font>

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Us trolls have to be careful.
You know that.</font>

77
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm not
<i>really</i> a troll, okay?</font>

78
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just started
as a yelp reviewer</font>

79
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">And got sick of how stupid
everyone's comments sounded.</font>

80
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just like messing with people
'cause it was funny.</font>

81
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got carried away.</font>

82
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are really dangerous
times, skankhunt.</font>

83
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are things happening
in the world,</font>

84
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And trolls
have to come together.</font>

85
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

86
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone is trying
to wipe us out.</font>

87
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our way of life
is in danger.</font>

88
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a way of life.</font>

89
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just doing it
for the lols.</font>

90
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true.
I've studied your work.</font>

91
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one of the best trolls
I've ever seen.</font>

92
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I'm done
with this crap.</font>

93
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought my wife
was gonna find out.</font>

94
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was too spooky.</font>

95
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald,
we need each other!</font>

96
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">The danish are planning
something horrible against us!</font>

97
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not one of you,
okay?</font>

98
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to stop.</font>

99
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I've been
thinking this over a lot,</font>

100
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we need
to be more active</font>

101
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">In showing the girls
we respect them.</font>

102
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a big
girls' volleyball game tonight,</font>

103
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we should all go
and show our support.</font>

104
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think
that's gonna make a difference?</font>

105
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. We need to show the girls
that all boys</font>

106
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't the same, and that we are
willing to change.</font>

107
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, why don't you
shut the fuck up, kyle?</font>

108
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I've been hearing about
the past few weeks</font>

109
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is how this is <i>our</i> problem,
how <i>boys</i> need to change.</font>

110
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm getting
pretty sick of it!</font>

111
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else
seems to be able to be proud</font>

112
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of who they are,
but not us.</font>

113
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we got uncle kyle here
telling us the girls are right.</font>

114
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters.
This is a war
on all of us!</font>

115
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to listen
to uncle kyle? Go ahead!</font>

116
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty soon they'll be
locking us all up.</font>

117
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't think you're safe,
either, tweek and craig.</font>

118
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 'cause you're gay
doesn't mean</font>

119
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">You aren't looked down upon
for being boys.</font>

120
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world wants us all
to feel shame</font>

121
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 'cause we were all born
with wieners!</font>

122
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters,
you need to calm down.</font>

123
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! We tried doing it
your way, kyle.</font>

124
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried doing what the girls
wanted us to do,</font>

125
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where
did it get us?</font>

126
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nowhere.</font>

127
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right! It turned us against
one of our own,</font>

128
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what it did!</font>

129
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to eric cartman is
the girls' fault, not ours!</font>

130
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true.</font>

131
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done feeling guilt.</font>

132
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a boy, dag nab it.</font>

133
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what,
I'm proud of my little wiener!</font>

134
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:54,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark my words —</font>

135
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">The moment is coming
when you all need to decide.</font>

136
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you with your kind,
or are you with uncle kyle?</font>

137
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald, you've been
sitting at the table</font>

138
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">For three hours now.
You okay?</font>

139
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm great. Totally good just
sitting and... Doing nothing.</font>

140
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem
with that?</font>

141
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem with wanting
to sit and just be?</font>

142
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that illegal now?</font>

143
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all, gerald.
I'm sorry.</font>

144
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm totally happy.</font>

145
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm... Happy.</font>

146
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to do anything
to <i>make</i> me happy.</font>

147
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

148
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I know you said
your computer was broken, so...</font>

149
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went ahead
and got you something.</font>

150
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here,
it's your own ipad.</font>

151
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Aah! Aah!</font>

152
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I-I-I'm good.
Get that away from me.</font>

153
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like it?</font>

154
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sorry, I love it.</font>

155
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just... Swearing off
electronics for a little bit.</font>

156
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe I could just get on
a couple of message boards.</font>

157
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I'm good!</font>

158
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need it!</font>

159
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald,
what's going on?</font>

160
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing, sheila.
I'm fine.</font>

161
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying
to make some changes,</font>

162
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And less electronics
is part of it.</font>

163
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, honey.
Everything is okay. I promise.</font>

164
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, gerald.
I'll make us some lunch.</font>

165
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, did that guy outside
talk to you?</font>

166
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">What guy outside?</font>

167
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

168
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">go away! Go!</font>

169
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go away! Go! Go!</font>

170
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

171
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome,
students and parents,</font>

172
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">To tonight's match-up
between the south park cows</font>

173
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the buena vista demons.</font>

174
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude,
this is awesome!</font>

175
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see how many of the boys
I got to come tonight?</font>

176
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is
a pretty sweet turnout.</font>

177
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly
what we needed.</font>

178
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank god
people listened to me.</font>

179
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, please sit, stand,</font>

180
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or kneel
for the national anthem.</font>

181
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:16,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy crap, dude.
Look at butters.</font>

182
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

183
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son a bitch!</font>

184
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

185
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald.</font>

186
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come on in.
You're not alone, bud.</font>

187
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all facing
the same struggles</font>

188
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And trying to do something
about it.</font>

189
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, please continue,
richard.</font>

190
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, like I was saying,
I've been addicted</font>

191
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">To memberberries
for about two months now.</font>

192
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, man.
You're not alone.</font>

193
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, you know,</font>

194
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Membering is so much more fun
than thinking.</font>

195
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want so bad to go back
when things were good —</font>

196
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a kid, you know?</font>

197
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, the '80s and the '90s,
and things made sense, you know?</font>

198
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's how we got here to
this very memberberry election.</font>

199
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

200
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have been your struggles
with memberberries, gerald?</font>

201
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I don't even know
what a member—</font>

202
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Memberberry #1:
Member the degobah system?</font>

203
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Memberberry #2:
Oh, I loved degobah!</font>

204
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where yoda lived!
Memberberry #3:
Member yoda?</font>

205
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I member!</font>

206
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michael, are there memberberries
in your pocket?</font>

207
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh-ho!
Member corellian corvettes?</font>

208
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I member
corellian corvettes!</font>

209
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

210
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, gerald,
what has your experience been?</font>

211
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
what memberberries are.</font>

212
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald, come on.
The first step towards healing</font>

213
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is admitting
you've got a problem.</font>

214
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
Well, you've got a fat pussy,</font>

215
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you should go
and fucking kill yourself!</font>

216
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.
I think I'm in the wrong place.</font>

217
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make no mistake.</font>

218
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I <i>want</i> to be very upset.</font>

219
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, as a community,
we have all decided</font>

220
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That people have the right
to protest the national anthem.</font>

221
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took
their wieners out!</font>

222
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.
But they did so peacefully</font>

223
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And without malice
towards others.</font>

224
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was
an attack on us.</font>

225
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly why
we sat out the national anthem</font>

226
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:44,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the first place!</font>

227
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to understand
something, ladies.</font>

228
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am in a pc pretzel here</font>

229
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if I say
they can't protest</font>

230
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though you protested,</font>

231
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only difference is
their protest</font>

232
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Included physical gestures,
then I'm body-shaming!</font>

233
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you're just gonna
let boys take their wieners out</font>

234
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever they want?</font>

235
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:07,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what happens when
you sit out the national anthem.</font>

236
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We walk together in peace!</i></font>

237
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,605
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We walk together in pride!</i></font>

238
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,475
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We are not going to feel</i>
<i>ashamed for who we are!</i></font>

239
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,745
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We are not going to feel guilt</i>
<i>for the way we were born!</i></font>

240
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,813
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wieners out!</i>
<i>Wieners out!</i></font>

241
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,482
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't let anyone tell you</i>
<i>you're somehow less</i></font>

242
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,350
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Because you're a boy!</i></font>

243
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,821
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't let anyone tell you</i>
<i>to not think with your wiener,</i></font>

244
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,123
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As if your wiener is</i>
<i>a bad thing!</i></font>

245
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!
That's right!</font>

246
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,626
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What makes us different</i>
<i>makes us beautiful!</i></font>

247
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,961
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No more shame!</i>
<i>No more doubt!</i></font>

248
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,197
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No more bigotry!</i></font>

249
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wieners out!</font>

250
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't be an uncle kyle!</i></font>

251
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Be proud of who you are!</i></font>

252
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,236
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You are either with us</i>
<i>or against us!</i></font>

253
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's really that simple!</i></font>

254
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">damn it! Get out of here!</font>

255
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop that!</font>

256
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to work
tonight?</font>

257
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope!
Nothing!</font>

258
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. I don't remember
the last time you were able</font>

259
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">To actually get in bed
at the same time as me.</font>

260
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got all caught up
with my work!</font>

261
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:23,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm not complaining.
It feels good to have you here.</font>

262
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going on a run!</font>

263
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you!</font>

265
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">yeah.</font>

266
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw you, skank.</font>

267
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fat, little bitch!</font>

268
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go —
go kill yourself, whore!</font>

269
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, fuck you, bitch!</font>

270
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you! Yeahhaha haha!</font>

271
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, bitch! Hahaha!</font>

272
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gerald?</font>

273
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">aah!</font>

274
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, sorry, hon!</font>

275
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:52,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry!</font>

276
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything all right,
guys?</font>

277
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's fine, kyle.
Go back to bed.</font>

278
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">One night, y-you say all
our computer stuff is broken,</font>

279
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you —
you hide everything!</font>

280
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you show up
with all this new equipment</font>

281
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now this!
Please!</font>

282
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me
what's going on!</font>

283
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing is going on.</font>

284
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hissed at me!
You went</font>

285
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:14,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. I-I'm going to tell
you the truth, sheila.</font>

286
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:17,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watch porn
on the internet.</font>

287
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

288
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try to stop.</font>

289
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know
you watch porn.</font>

290
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me
you watch porn,</font>

291
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I told you
I don't care, gerald.</font>

292
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah!
But, uh...</font>

293
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's, uh...</font>

294
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is different.</font>

295
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Because it's not...
Normal porn?</font>

296
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

297
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like something
really embarrassing?</font>

298
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really embarrassing.</font>

299
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

300
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... Porn.</font>

301
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... Piss... Porn.</font>

302
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piss porn.</font>

303
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piss porn?</font>

304
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like people
peeing on each other?</font>

305
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?
It's so embarrassing.</font>

306
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder I hid it,
right?</font>

307
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phew.
I'm sorry.</font>

308
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to get it out
in the open, though.</font>

309
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want <i>me</i>
<i>to pee on you?</i></font>

310
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:00,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

311
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only like watching
<i>other</i> women pee?</font>

312
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no. It's —
it's not like that.</font>

313
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because
they're pretty?</font>

314
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to
watch it on a video</font>

315
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm overweight
and old?</font>

316
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!
I-I-I want you to.</font>

317
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just couldn't ask.</font>

318
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do? Promise?</font>

319
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

320
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I doing it right,
gerald?</font>

321
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

322
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">So hot, honey.</font>

323
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Warm. Ugh.</font>

324
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, cartman.</font>

325
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, kyle.</font>

326
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

327
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we did to you.</font>

328
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">This internet troll
has everyone going crazy.</font>

329
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't have assumed
it was you.</font>

330
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't have...
Broke all your stuff.</font>

331
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

332
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's cool.</font>

333
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I know it's not cool.</font>

334
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're figuring out
how to get back at us.</font>

335
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a vagina, kyle.</font>

336
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

337
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not holding a grudge.</font>

338
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happier now.
I have purpose.</font>

339
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw whose vagina?
My girlfriend's.</font>

340
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">She stood six feet away
and flashed it really fast.</font>

341
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in that instant,
you know what I saw?</font>

342
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw that humankind
could colonize mars.</font>

343
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the potential
of our species</font>

344
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">To terraform other planets
and reach the infinite.</font>

345
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right, okay.
I'm being serious, cartman.</font>

346
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters needs
to be taken down a notch,</font>

347
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:46,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're
the best at that.</font>

348
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric! Hey, I got us
chocolate milks!</font>

349
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you did,
'cause you're amazing.</font>

350
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look
what I made you.</font>

351
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pink and blue one?</font>

352
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what
my baby wanted.</font>

353
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:54,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yay!
Put it on me!</font>

354
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry.
Heidi, you know kyle.</font>

355
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
Hey, kyle.</font>

356
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">The show's on
at 5:00 tonight</font>

357
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to watch
at your house or my house.</font>

358
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, either way, we totally can.
I just —</font>

359
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess kyle had something
to talk to us about first.</font>

360
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, kyle.</font>

361
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

362
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">The school's
in trouble and, um...</font>

363
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">O-our friends are —</font>

364
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said something about us
working together</font>

365
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">To help
take down butters?</font>

366
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
What's going on, boo?</font>

367
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure, boo.</font>

368
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you start
from the beginning, kyle?</font>

369
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi's amazing
at figuring things out.</font>

370
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't supposed to be
like this.</font>

371
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just thought it was funny
making people get riled up.</font>

372
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just stupid, harmless
locker-room humor...</font>

373
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until I made that lady
kill herself.</font>

374
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't deny
who you are, skankhunt.</font>

375
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't call me that here!</font>

376
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you just
go away?</font>

377
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because
we're all in danger!</font>

378
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you see the video
I sent you?</font>

379
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!
Don't you get it?</font>

380
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went protocol zero!</font>

381
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I broke my phone!</font>

382
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deleted
all my e-mail accounts</font>

383
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that nobody
can trace me ever again!</font>

384
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be able to.</font>

385
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone.</font>

386
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to see this video,
skankhunt.</font>

387
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world
is about to change.</font>

388
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know
what's really going on?</font>

389
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you
what's going on.</font>

390
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though women have made
great gains in the last century,</font>

391
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's still a part of men
who aren't comfortable</font>

392
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">With women having power.</font>

393
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really
just comes down to that.</font>

394
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you have social media,
which allows men to</font>

395
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anonymously say horrific things
like "women aren't funny,"</font>

396
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though heidi's, like,
the funniest person I ever met.</font>

397
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pssh, shut up.</font>

398
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's true.
Get over yourself.</font>

399
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even try
to be funny.</font>

400
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. You don't have to
because you're awesome.</font>

401
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman, will you just help me
mess with butters</font>

402
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">To stop his little agro club
from getting any bigger?</font>

403
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, mess with
butters how?</font>

404
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean,
"mess with butters?"</font>

405
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I mean.
Come on!</font>

406
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need
the old cartman back.</font>

407
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:02,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I see.
You have a problem with heidi.</font>

408
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
You're threatened by her</font>

409
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she actually has
interesting things to say</font>

410
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's
funnier than you.</font>

411
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true at all.</font>

412
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she's <i>not</i>
<i>funnier than you?</i></font>

413
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is she just not funny
because she's a girl?</font>

414
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Babe, stop. I don't think
he meant anything by it.</font>

415
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, babe. It just
really ruffles my feathers.</font>

416
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, kyle,
I think it's great</font>

417
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to patch things up
with everyone,</font>

418
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the truth is,
eric and I are</font>

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just kind of
out of it now.</font>

420
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just
out of it now.</font>

421
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gave up social media
and all the ugliness</font>

422
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">That goes along with it,

<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can take
any troll comment</font>

442
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">And send it
through the danish servers</font>

443
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where a real name and a physical
address will be attached.</font>

444
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every message, every comment
ever made by trolls</font>

445
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will retroactively be given
a tag with the author's name,</font>

446
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Location,
and full internet history.</font>

447
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

448
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:35,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you.</font>

449
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is the man
who has masterminded it all.</font>

450
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">What this
will allow people to do</font>

451
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is trace back harmful
and hateful postings or e-mails.</font>

452
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, the troll hides behind
a protective layer,</font>

453
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you will, that
internet anonymity provides.</font>

454
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">We intend to strip them
of that protection</font>

455
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that everyone will know
who they are.</font>

456
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about people
who will use this</font>

457
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">To spy on others
who aren't trolls?</font>

458
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what do you mean?</font>

459
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once your servers
become active,</font>

460
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone could trace
anything on the internet</font>

461
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to
whoever wrote it.</font>

462
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you stop that
from happening?</font>

463
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh. Right.</font>

464
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:14,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">This service is only for tracing
the identity of trolls.</font>

465
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

466
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,214
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Komme oot troll.</i></font>

467
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,284
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Komme oot und dee.</i></font>

468
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I google translated
the last part.</font>

469
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says "come out, troll.</font>

470
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come out and die."</font>

471
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be happening.</font>

472
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">By next week, everything
everyone has ever done online</font>

473
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is gonna be available
to the public.</font>

474
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's over.</font>

475
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-I'm dead.</font>

476
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not dead,
skankhunt.</font>

477
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's still hope.</font>

478
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone! Can I have
your attention please?</font>

479
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the past few weeks
have been very difficult...</font>

480
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all of us.</font>

481
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, now more than ever,
that something has to change.</font>

482
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought a lot about this
the past few days.</font>

483
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:04,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen a lot of things I
never thought I would ever see.</font>

484
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are all complex issues
we're having to face.</font>

485
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I know
that after you break it down,</font>

486
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's really
only one answer.</font>

487
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good for you,
uncle kyle!</font>

488
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellow trolls, let me
introduce you to... Skankhunt42.</font>

489
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not necessarily
skankhunt42.</font>

490
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, skank.</font>

491
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're with
your kind.</font>

492
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I doing it right,
gerald?</font>

493
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

494
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">So hot, honey.</font>

495
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Warm. Ugh.</font>
