<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Netflix.</font>

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year, we approved
16 original shows and movies,</font>

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this year, it is our goal
to make that number 1,087.</font>

00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,323

are thrilled to be working</font>

Terrance and Phillip.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Classic stuff.</font>

16
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now go ahead
and pitch what you're thinking</font>

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">for your Netflix
original series.</font>

18
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we were thinking
that we'd do a show</font>

19
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Phillip and I
are on a farm.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">With a cow.</font>

21
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
I love it so far.</font>

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I say, "Terrance!
You farted!"</font>

00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I...</font>

00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cartman and his
girlfriend are fighting again!</font>

00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart!
Piece of shit!</font>

00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey! I wanna watch
"Terrance and Phillip"</font>

00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">tonight with my friends!</font>

45
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised we'd have
a date night!</font>

46
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!</font>

47
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just one night, babe!</font>

48
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan is having
a viewing party, honey!</font>

49
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">So then why can't I come?</font>

50
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Terrance and Phillip"
is guys' night thing baby!</font>

51
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, hey!</font>

52
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you all doing?</font>

53
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watching Heidi
get her bitch-ass kicked!</font>

54
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you,
Wendy!</font>

55
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take that crap,
Heidi!</font>

56
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let Cartman have it!</font>

57
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys! Guys, this has gone on
way too long!</font>

58
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we all stop being
so mean to each other?</font>

59
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Kyle.
You sound like your mom.</font>

60
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was awesome, baby.
I love you.</font>

61
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, too,
babe.</font>

62
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aww...
Damn it.</font>

63
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fights over.
Kyle ruined it!</font>

64
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone.
Listen up.</font>

65
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know, there has been
a lot of bullying</font>

66
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">and insensitivity
at our school.</font>

67
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">To counteract this,
it is my firm belief</font>

68
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">that South Park Elementary</font>

69
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">is in desperate need
of a strong woman.</font>

70
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in looking for
a new vice principal,</font>

71
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wanted to find
a powerful, intelligent,</font>

72
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">and independent female
to be a role model for us all.</font>

73
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with that said,
I'd like to introduce</font>

74
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">our new vice principal...
Strong Woman.</font>

75
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you,
PC Principal.</font>

76
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone.
Listen up.</font>

77
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the new vice principal
of the school.</font>

78
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Strong Woman.</font>

79
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already spent a few days
here at the school</font>

80
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">watching and observing,</font>

81
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we definitely have things
we can all be working on.</font>

82
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Stotch!</font>

83
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not disrespect
Strong Woman</font>

84
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">by talking
when she's talking.</font>

85
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think I couldn't have
handled that myself?</font>

86
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Uh, I was just
making sure everything was...</font>

87
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really had to grab the mic
out of my hand like that?</font>

88
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit. I mean... No, sorry.
Sorry, I'm not...</font>

89
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, here you go.</font>

90
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the girls
here at this school</font>

91
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">to know that they can talk to me
about anything.</font>

92
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I also want
the boys to know</font>

93
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">that what I'm looking for
is a better place for everybody.</font>

94
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turning this school around</font>

95
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">is going to take work
from everyone.</font>

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">From everyone.</font>

97
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Am I not
doing this correctly?</font>

98
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. Sorry! I thought I'd
add... Just add for emphasis.</font>

99
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You felt it wasn't
strong enough, me saying it?</font>

100
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm...
Uh, I'm sorry.</font>

101
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking forward to being
your vice principal.</font>

102
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm looking forward to
turning this school around.</font>

103
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Now,
if we have any que...</font>

104
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not finished.</font>

105
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right!
Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

106
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pay attention, everybody!</font>

107
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's "The Terrance
& Phillip Show!"</font>

108
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Netflix.</font>

109
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Terrance!</font>

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did the black lawyer
say to the Muslim priest?</font>

111
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Phillip.
What?</font>

112
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in!</font>

113
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we miss it?
It's just starting.</font>

114
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, honey...
Kyle's mom is here!</font>

115
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't you be at Temple,
Ms. Broflovski?</font>

116
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hola.</font>

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to buy
some chimichangas?</font>

118
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,603
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sí, mi amigo!</i></font>

119
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. I'll give you
two pesos.</font>

120
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude,
that's awesome!</font>

121
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha-What's wrong,
dude?</font>

122
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time,
I feel kinda bad</font>

123
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the person
being farted on.</font>

124
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohp. Kyle's mom doesn't like
the cartoon, guys.</font>

125
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better shut it off.</font>

126
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, I fuckin' love you
so much.</font>

127
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone.
Listen up.</font>

128
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you all know, we've been
looking for a strong woman</font>

129
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">to take on the roll of
vice principal at this school.</font>

130
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't be happier
with the selection we've made,</font>

131
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're sure she'll be making
our school a better place.</font>

132
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">So with that,
let me turn over the floor</font>

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">to our new vice principal...
Strong Woman.</font>

134
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, everyone.
All right. Listen up.</font>

135
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fully appreciate
that some of you</font>

136
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">might be uncomfortable
with me being here.</font>

137
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earlier today, I noticed that
some faculty</font>

138
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">weren't sure whether to call me
Miss Woman or just Strong.</font>

139
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were a man,
you'd probably address me</font>

140
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">as Vice Principal Woman,</font>

141
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">so why would it should it be
any different, huh?</font>

142
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">We good?
M'kay.</font>

143
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I've been getting to know
some of the students here,</font>

144
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm definitely hearing</font>

145
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lot of frustration
and confusion</font>

146
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">over issues that all the schools
are facing right now.</font>

147
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I also spent some time
observing in the cafeteria</font>

148
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">and was pretty shocked by the
abusive and intolerant language.</font>

00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you have a problem
with Canada,</font>

295
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe you should talk to
your backward president!</font>

296
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe I will!
- 'Kay, go ahead!</font>

297
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I know
the president.</font>

298
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure you do,
just like all Jewish moms</font>

299
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you don't understand
how...</font>

300
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop calling me that!
Can I finish?</font>

301
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you know
is how to be mean and...</font>

302
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a...
Can I finish please?</font>

303
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you were all
raised on it yourselves!</font>

304
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, can I finish?</font>

305
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm finished.</font>

306
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone, listen up.</font>

307
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know we want to provide
a safe work environment</font>

308
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all our employees.</font>

309
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes feelings do arise</font>

310
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we are tempted by the devil
to act upon them.</font>

311
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we've been reaching out
to Human Resources Division</font>

312
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">as I think we can all
use someone to tell us</font>

313
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what is and isn't
considered misconduct.</font>

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has some great advice
for us,</font>

315
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">so now please welcome
Heather Conduct.</font>

316
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, Miss Conduct.</font>

317
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, everyone,
my name is Miss Conduct.</font>

318
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to talk about
making sure we avoid</font>

319
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">any trouble at this school,
m'all right?</font>

320
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay.</font>

321
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right.</font>

322
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, by a show of hands,</font>

323
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's ever had inappropriate
feelings for a co-worker?</font>

324
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:47,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello there,
little girl.</font>

325
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you selling
girl scout cookies?</font>

326
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, yes I am.
How about a snickerdoodle?</font>

327
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:58,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
You asked for it.</font>

328
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh, I think
I shit my pants.</font>

329
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right! That's it!
Everyone stop!</font>

330
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're shutting it down!</font>

331
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are
Millennials Against Canada!</font>

332
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">We demand this kind of bullying</font>

333
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canadian entertainment

334
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't think I'd live
long enough to see</font>

335
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">this all happen again.</font>

336
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">More and More millennials
are turning into Jewish mothers</font>

337
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">today as they demand
the censorship of entertainment.</font>

338
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">The protesters say they're
not giving up and are demanding</font>

coming in on your phone!</font>

341
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good give it here!
Yes, hello?</font>

342
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the leader of
the Millennials Against Canada.</font>

343
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle, what the fuck
are you doing?</font>

344
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking
a stand and doing something.</font>

345
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize this doesn't gel
with your nihilism!</font>

346
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, dude. I didn't
want to have say this,</font>

347
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're really starting
to sound like your mom.</font>

348
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not like my mom!</font>

349
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make a difference!</font>

350
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna feel real good!</font>

351
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle? Kyle!</font>

352
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do this man!</font>

353
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't mess
with this shit</font>

354

<font color="#FFFFFF">while You Know Who
is in office!</font>

355

<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all gonna die!</font>

356
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right,
so now everyone,</font>

357
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna do some
role playing, m'all right,</font>

358
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:28,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">talk about appropriate ways
we can talk in the workplace.</font>

359
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I... Can I get a volunteer
to role play with me?</font>

360
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right?
How about you Mister, uh...</font>

361
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Mackey.</font>

362
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right, come on up here.</font>

363
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right now,
we're just gonna pretend</font>

364
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a normal morning
before work</font>

365
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're startin' the day.
M'all right?</font>

366
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mr. Mackey,
good morning.</font>

367
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, uh,
Miss Conduct.</font>

368
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now did you have
a nice night?</font>

369
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, it was good.</font>

370
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right, okay, well,
good luck today,</font>

371
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I hope that
our working relationship</font>

372
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">can continue be honest
and straightforward.</font>

373
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm very open and honest,
I promise you that.</font>

374
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see that, you've got
very honest eyes, m'all right.</font>

375
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right, I probably
shouldn't have said.</font>

376
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You have honest eyes,"
m'all right.</font>

377
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a bit crossin'
the line commenting</font>

378
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">on his physical attributes,
m'all right? That's bad.</font>

379
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stick to just talking
about work only, m'all right?</font>

380
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh, Mr. Mackey,
what methods do you use</font>

381
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">for counseling the students?</font>

382
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I mostly use
a semi-cognitive approach</font>

383
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">adapted
by Kiezrick Solomon.</font>

384
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, you studied Solomon?</font>

385
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was actually my thesis
in college.</font>

386
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious? Nobody I talk
to has ever even heard of him!</font>

387
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Same here!</font>

388
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">What made you attracted
to his work?</font>

389
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just such
a natural approach, m'kay.</font>

390
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right.
M'all right.</font>

391
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I read it, you know,
first, I was like,</font>

392
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Whoa, okay."
M'all right.</font>

393
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">"This just really makes
sense," you know?</font>

394
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, m'all right.</font>

395
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm'kay.</font>

396
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right.</font>

397
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mister President, you need
to do something</font>

398
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">about your millennials!</font>

399
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want<i> me</i> to do?</font>

400
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrance and Phillip
are Canada's largest export!</font>

401
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">They account for 80%
of our gross national product!</font>

402
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your citizens mess with them,
they mess with all of us.</font>

403
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm president
of the United States.</font>

404
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get involved
in every petty little protest</font>

405
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">against a third world country.</font>

406
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Third world country?
How dare you!</font>

407
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Canada is second world at least!</font>

408
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you listen here,
Mr. Buddy!</font>

409
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either you stop the embargo on
the "Terrance and Phillip show,"</font>

410
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we'll bring in our own troops
to stop it ourselves!</font>

411
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you threatening us,
you beady-eyed Canuck?</font>

412
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm simply telling you
that Canada will do</font>

413
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">what it must
to protect itself!</font>

414
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I guess both our countries
better be prepared.</font>

415
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, you know, I was looking for
something to get away from the city.</font>

416
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never really been
a city person.</font>

417
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right. M'all right.</font>

418
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">I definitely get that.
M'all right.</font>

419
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like hiking around,
being around in nature, m'kay.</font>

420
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree, I agree,
the city's bad.</font>

421
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love hiking, too. What are
some of your favorite places?</font>

422
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well you know Mount Evans
is always nice.</font>

423
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'all right.
M'all right.</font>

424
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

425
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's some kind of...</font>

426
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">military alert going out.</font>

427
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
military alert everyone.</font>

428
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get to the hallways</font>

429
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get the students
to the gymnasium.</font>

430
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Let's move!</font>

431
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the National Guard!</font>

432
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">The National Guard?</font>

433
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the President!
He wants to talk to you.</font>

434
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, this is
Millennials Against Canada.</font>

435
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, listen this thing
is kind of escalating.</font>

436
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You people need to
call it quits.</font>

437
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't do that,
Mr. President.</font>

438
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has to do
what's right!</font>

439
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly do you want?</font>

440
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I want?</font>

441
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a world...</font>

442
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">where laughter doesn't come
at someone else's expense,</font>

443
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">where people can live freely
without fear of being farted on.</font>

444
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a world where you aren't
ridiculed for trying to help!</font>

445
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">A world where a nice girl
that I liked</font>

446
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't turned into
another Eric Cartman!</font>

447
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">These Canadians are
in the way of that world</font>

448
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everything they do
and everything they have done</font>

449
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">needs to be erased
from the Earth!</font>

450
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez, I got a little chub.</font>

451
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!
Everyone to the gymnasium now!</font>

452
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard her!
Move it people!</font>

453
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to make sure all
the classrooms are empty.</font>

454
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go take cover
with the kids!</font>

455
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming, too!</font>

456
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your Vice Principal!</font>

457
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, come on!</font>

458
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
What's wrong?</font>

459
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vice Principal Woman,
I need to ask you something.</font>

460
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. This is very
difficult, but, uh...</font>

461
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What?</font>

462
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, as you can see,</font>

463
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is a door
in front of us.</font>

464
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, there is.</font>

465
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to open this door for you,
however I understand the gender-based biases</font>

466
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this could imply. Why do
you need to open the door?</font>

467
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need to open
the door.</font>

468
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I
would for counselor Mackey, a student, or anyone else.</font>

469
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's going to have
to open the door,</font>

470
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:58,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we could die out here.</font>

471
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ With a little love
and some tenderness ♪</font>

472

00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:31,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ 'Cause I've got
a hand for you ♪</font>

477
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ 'Cause I wanna run with you ♪</font>

478
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ Yesterday ♪</font>

479
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,898

your hair ♪</font>

482
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:54,744

your attention please?</i></font>

available at the front desk.</i></font>
