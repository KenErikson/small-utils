<font color="#FFFFFF">They just canceled

We made plans!</font>

18
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some asshole went
and convinced the school board</font>

19
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Columbus Day is racist
and should be eliminated.</font>

26
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">will not celebrate
Columbus Day this year.</font>

27
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize this is</font>

28

<font color="#FFFFFF">a hot-button issue

30
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">has really swayed my opinion

31

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Randy Marsh.</font>

32
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Marsh pointed out to me
the hypocrisy</font>

33
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">of glorifying
a genocidal murderer.</font>

34
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Mr. Marsh is, right now,
also working</font>

35
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,668

taken down in Canyon City.</font>

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take
this fuckin' thing down!</font>

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah!</font>

39
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it down!</font>

40
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Columbus was a mass murderer!</font>

41
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tear it down!
Tear it down!</font>

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

43
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, it's not working.</font>

44
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We almost got it, guys!</font>

45
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!
Throw the rope, Stan!</font>

46
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. That's good!</font>

47
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
hit the gas, Nelson!</font>

48
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got it,
everybody!</font>

49
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">To hell with you,
Columbus, you...</font>

50
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

51
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dude.</font>

52
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, did you know
it's<i> your</i> dad</font>

53
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's getting the school
to cancel Columbus Day?</font>

54
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Dude, I don't know
what's going on.</font>

55
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's really serious
about this.</font>

56
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you got to
do something.</font>

57
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get him to back down,</font>

58
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe the school
will reconsider.</font>

59
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:40,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get him
to back down.</font>

60
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, I have to deal
with my mom</font>

61
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">doing shit like this
all the time,</font>

62
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she's never tried
to take away a holiday.</font>

63
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your best friend,
but I can't have your back</font>

64
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the guys
find out about this.</font>

65
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try, okay?</font>

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to go.</font>

67
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Stan.
You got your phone?</font>

68
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to call
everyone on this list.</font>

69
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all live
in the same city.</font>

70
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, listen, you need
to ease off a little here, okay?</font>

71
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, it's not right
that people celebrate a man</font>

72
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wiped out
millions of people</font>

73
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">for his own glory.
Let's go.</font>

74
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, is this, uh,
Howard Peterson?</font>

75
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live in Columbus, Ohio.
Is that correct?</font>

76
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
You racist piece of shit.</font>

77
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard me.</font>

78
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an
intolerant pig.</font>

79
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're not?</font>

80
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just choose to live in a
city named for ethnic cleansing?</font>

81
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, fuck you.</font>

82
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rename your city, asshole.</font>

83
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

84
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, next one.
Come on. Get calling, Stan.</font>

85
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, come on.</font>

86
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all get your point,</font>

87
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">but don't you think
you're overdoing it?</font>

88
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to overdo
it in today's society, Stan.</font>

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be nuanced
and subtle anymore</font>

90
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">or else critics go, "Wow,
what was the point of that?"</font>

91
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Francis Melman?</font>

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! How are you,
you fuckin' racist?</font>

93
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher Columbus...</font>

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explorer, pioneer.</font>

95
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he someone
who should be appreciated?</font>

96
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or was he
just a douche?</font>

97
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">For years. Columbus Circle
has been a landmark</font>

98
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">and photogenic intersection
in New York City.</font>

99
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it came as a surprise</font>

100
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">when someone defecated
on the statue earlier today.</font>

101
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm joined now by the man
who did the actual defecating,</font>

102
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Randy Marsh
of South Park, Colorado.</font>

103
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening!</font>

104
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Marsh, you took a dump
on the beloved statue that</font>

105
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been an icon here
in the city for years.</font>

106
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was your reasoning?</font>

107
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just
have a problem</font>

108
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the racist people
of this city.</font>

109
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Yee-haw!
I'm from New York."</font>

110
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drive around
a big circle</font>

111
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">that celebrates a guy
who murdered Native Americans.</font>

112
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Shoo wee!"</font>

113
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you're doing this
because of indigenous peoples</font>

114
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their feelings?</font>

115
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care
if people get indigenous.</font>

116
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll crap all over
their statues.</font>

117
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one who's indigenous
that this landmark even exists!</font>

118
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, uh...
ba-back to you, Tom.</font>

119
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't right.</font>

120
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">They make you
work like a dog</font>

121
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then just tear away
your one day off in October</font>

122
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you're
a piece of trash.</font>

123
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boo! Boo!
Nobody likes you, Stan.</font>

125
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:01,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I tried talking to him, all right? He's
just really against all the things Columbus did.</font>

126
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody know
what Columbus actually did?</font>

127
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. In 1492, Columbus got us
a day off school.</font>

128
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what matters.</font>

129
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, wait, guys.
Maybe that's it.</font>

130
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm dealing
with my mom,</font>

131
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes it works to be
on her side for a minute.</font>

132
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should find out
all the things</font>

133
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">people find offensive
about Columbus and...</font>

134
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then totally act
like we care.</font>

135
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like it, Kyle.</font>

136
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just look up "Columbus,
offensive, inflammatory..."</font>

137
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is sweet.</font>

138
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like that movie where the dude
pretended to be on the monster's side.</font>

139
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, with the guy and the
chick that had the wife beater on,</font>

140
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">but her boobs were sweaty
so you could see them.</font>

141
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:28,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I love
that movie!</font>

142
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is
a lot like that.</font>

143
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you find, Kyle?</font>

144
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dang it!
There's nothing?</font>

146
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, can I talk to you
for a minute?</font>

147
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What?
What the hell was that?</font>

148
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:43,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dad?</font>

149
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, Stan.</font>

00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,076
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You will make this Monday
a school holiday.</i></font>

297
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spoke with Mr. Marsh,
and he denied any wrong doing.</font>

298
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Of course he did!</i></font>

299
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,115
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's what liars do!</i></font>

300
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you're being
intimidating enough.</font>

301
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
<i>Meaner like how, dude?</i></font>

302
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,722
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i> I don't know, like... like maybe say.. .
Like talk about cutting off his dick or something.</i></font>

303
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,390
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're gonna
cut off your dick!</i></font>

304
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,061
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i> No, dude. That's too far. Okay,
okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.</i></font>

305
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,261
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just give me

to pay for what he's done.</i></font>

307
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,366
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Protect him
and you will pay, too.</i></font>

308
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time is running out.</font>

309
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

310
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharon, have you seen
my Columbus staff and orb?</font>

311
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have not.</font>

312
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharon, Galtman
called again.</font>

313
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody is out there trying to
get me in trouble.</font>

314
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, why don't you just
admit to people</font>

315
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">that maybe you were
somewhat overly excited</font>

316
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">about Columbus in the past.</font>

317
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone was excited
about Columbus!</font>

318
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some reason, people are just
pointing fingers at me.</font>

319
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because he's suddenly
not cool now</font>

320
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't mean I'm gonna be
the Fing scapegoat!</font>

321
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to burn
this stuff.</font>

322
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God damn it.</font>

323
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wrote you a song
to express my feelings for you.</font>

324
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you
get out of here?</font>

325
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ And then he kissed me ♪</font>

326
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't kiss you
'cause I like you.</font>

327
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ And then he kissed me ♪</font>

328
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

329
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ And the sun
began to shine ♪</font>

330
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.
Get off my property!</font>

331
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy,
I cannot quit you.</font>

332
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off my land,
you piece of shit!</font>

333
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't post that.</font>

334
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not... post that.</font>

335
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

336
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, what are
you doing?</font>

337
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over, Eric.</font>

338
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to come to school
on Monday.</font>

339
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just face it.</font>

340
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not facing anything.
We still have time.</font>

341
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has to be
a way we can...</font>

342
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, there's nothing
we can do, all right?</font>

343
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay. I see.</font>

344
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what Columbus did?
Just give up?</font>

345
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">On his dream?
No.</font>

346
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Columbus believed that kids
should have a day off school.</font>

347
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even when his own country
wouldn't support his cause,</font>

348
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Columbus said, "Fine.
I'll go find a new land"</font>

349
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">where kids
can have that day off."</font>

350
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, just let it go.</font>

351
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when Columbus
sailed to distant places</font>

352
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">only to find people
already there</font>

353
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">who said, "No!
Stay off our land!"</font>

354
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want our kids
to have to go to school!"</font>

355
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said, "No!
It's just one day in October."</font>

356
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need a break!"</font>

357
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can all give up,
but I'm not.</font>

358
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because in 1492, Columbus
got us all a day off school.</font>

359
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">With just three ships,
he sailed over</font>

360
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we could have
some 'me time' in October.</font>

361
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, yes, millions were
slaughtered and throats were cut.</font>

362
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we don't get
that day off school,</font>

363
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">then for what?</font>

364
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys.</font>

365
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something else
we can try.</font>

366
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharon, good news!
What?</font>

367
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people from the DNA test
called!</font>

368
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're on their way over.
You want to come down?</font>

369
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing something.</font>

370
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?</font>

371
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">These results could
be really interesting.</font>

372
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:15,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God damn it!
What the hell do you want?</font>

373
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to stop
running from yourself.</font>

374
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could be so happy.</font>

375
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crap, it's them!</font>

376
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a second! Be right there!
Thanks!</font>

377
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get over here!</font>

378
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have any feelings
for you. Do you understand?</font>

379
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Randy,
what about the...</font>

380
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No buts!
There's nothing here.</font>

381
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not in love with you,
got it?</font>

382
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

383
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I understand.</font>

384
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Now leave.</font>

385
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. Sorry.
You guys have my results?</font>

386
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Mr. Marsh,
we came because</font>

387
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was an irregularity
with your test.</font>

388
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you found something there
you didn't expect to find?</font>

389
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

390
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's just
a little too odd.</font>

391
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to do
the test again.</font>

392
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it again?
That's not fair.</font>

393
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Marsh, please,</font>

394
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we could just have
one more sample.</font>

395
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want to be
absolutely sure</font>

396
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">of what we found.</font>

397
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... okay,
no problem.</font>

398
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me... Give me
one sec. I'll be right back.</font>

399
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Wait!</font>

400
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Okay.
All set. Let's do this.</font>

401
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

402
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Marsh, we were hoping
to do a more precise test.</font>

403
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better
for harder cases like this,</font>

404
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it is an anal swab
this time.</font>

405
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">An anal swab?</font>

406
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me..
Tw... three minutes.</font>

407
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, where'd you go?</font>

408
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Marsh, we're in
a bit of a hurry</font>

409
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't mind.</font>

410
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Oh, shit.</font>

411
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:59,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, it's clear.
Bring him in.</font>

412
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move your ass,
Galtman!</font>

413
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a violation
of my rights.</font>

414
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just shut up
and watch</font>

415
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">what someone posted
on their Instagram!</font>

416
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">I most certainly
will not!</font>

417
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want me to look at
the Internet, I will die first.</font>

418
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fake news.</font>

419
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we had it
transferred to VHS.</font>

420
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
VHS is fine.</font>

421
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off
his blindfold.</font>

422
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,806
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get off my land,
you piece of shit!</i></font>

423
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,476
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't post that.</i></font>

424
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

425
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:44,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mr. Marsh.</font>

426
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey!
How are you?</font>

427
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
What are you up to?</font>

428
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chillin', chillin'.</font>

429
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, uh, we did get your DNA
results back this morning.</font>

430
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to go over them?</font>

431
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you did?
Oh, great.</font>

432
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.
Why not? I'm here.</font>

433
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's, uh...
Let's do that.</font>

434
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Mr. Marsh,</font>

435
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">here's your
DNAandMe portfolio.</font>

436
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">This shows
that we actually found</font>

437
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">a mix of a few things
in your regional ancestry.</font>

438
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Like Native American?
Like... Like a little bit?</font>

439
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we didn't find any trace</font>

440
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">of any Native American DNA
in your test...</font>

441
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nuts.</font>

442
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as you can see here,
we found</font>

443
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're about
43% Northern European,</font>

444
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">37% Mediterranean,</font>

445
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">and 18% Southwest Asian.</font>

446
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, your genetic profile
most closely matches...</font>

447
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">your standard
Caucasian British person.</font>

448
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you might
be interested to know</font>

449
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you are actually
2.8 % Neanderthal,</font>

450
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is fairly high.</font>

451
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neanderthal?</font>

452
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that about?</font>

453
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the Neanderthals
were actually a species</font>

454
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was wiped out
by homo sapiens.</font>

455
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wiped out...
all of my people?</font>

456
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but you see,
because of some cross breeding,</font>

457
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">some people like you
still possess.</font>

458
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neanderthal DNA.</font>

459
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that interesting?</font>

460
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cross breeding?
You mean rape.</font>

461
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me
that my ancestors</font>

462
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">were raped
and then eradicated by you...</font>

463
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You maniacs?</font>

464
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Earth wasn't big enough
for Neanderthals,</font>

465
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">So your ancestors
just got rid of them, huh?</font>

466
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, to hell with all of you!</font>

467
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well.
Mr. Marsh.</font>

468
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to have a word, please.</font>

469
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find this funny,
Galtman?</font>

470
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd I do?</font>

471
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody had the guts</font>

472
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">to tell me what happened
to my people, huh?</font>

473
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the hell out of here!</font>

474
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought my parents over
so you could meet them.</font>

475
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

476
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

477
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents are very okay
and cool with us.</font>

478
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell is that?</font>

479
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sure, everyone gang up
on the Neanderthal!</font>

480
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't it funny?</font>

481
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, you must face
who you are.</font>

482
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop pretending, Randy.</font>

483
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">For once, just allow
yourself to feel.</font>

484
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.
You're right.</font>

485
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only now, when everyone's
being so indigenous to me,</font>

486
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:21,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I realize how indigenous
I've been acting all along.</font>

487
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought being a victim
would solve all my problems.</font>

488
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">But being a victim
has a downside, too.</font>

489
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Galtman,
I haven't been honest.</font>

490
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for us all
to be honest.</font>

491
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is a holiday?</font>

492
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a day off work, yes,
a day off school.</font>

493
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">But holidays are also meant
to be a time to reflect.</font>

494
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, I'm happy to announce</font>

495
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the school calendar
committee</font>

496
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">is reinstating the day off.</font>

497
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But instead
of glorifying anyone,</font>

498
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">let us make it a holiday</font>

499
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the negative feelings
that we all sometimes feel,</font>

500
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">say what we're really thinking
so we can move on.</font>

501
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so, the second Monday
of October</font>

502
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">will still be a holiday.</font>

503
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">But instead of Columbus Day,</font>

504
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will be
for ripping on each other</font>

505
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tearing each other down,</font>

506
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we will call it
Indigenous Peoples Day.</font>

507
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">For, perhaps, if we all do it
at the same time,</font>

508
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">we won't be so indigenous
the rest of the year.</font>

509
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">And since this is the second
Monday of October,</font>

510
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's all embrace
the new meaning of the holiday</font>

511
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">starting right now.</font>

512
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you even know</font>

513
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">what indigenous means,
you frickin' idiot?</font>

514
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the spirit, Dave!
Come on!</font>

515
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, let's just all
be totally indigenous!</font>

516
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

517
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell let this guy
talk to the school counsel?</font>

518
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good one, Kurt.
Your wife's a whore.</font>

519
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everyone!</font>

520
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indigenous Peoples Day!
Let's go for it!</font>

521
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up,
and get off the podium!</font>

522
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
I will in a second, fatso.</font>

523
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Who else?</font>

524
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!
Get it out of your system!</font>

525
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy Indigenous Peoples Day,
everyone.</font>

526
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suck my asshole.</font>

527
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy,
I cannot quit you.</font>

528
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off my land,
you piece of shit!</font>

529
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:07,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't post that.</font>
