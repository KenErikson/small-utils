292
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not going to start
a war they can't win.</font>

293
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:16,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

294
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Craig, I...
Tweek.</font>

295
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:19,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to stop thinking
about it.</font>

296
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what,
we're gonna go somewhere fun</font>

297
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make you feel better.</font>

298
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give a minute of your time
for suicide awareness?</font>

299
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:28,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suicide is serious.</font>

300
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help tell people like Kyle
it's not a joke.</font>

301
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, good for you guys,
trying to help.</font>

302
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, make sure everyone
you know gets involved</font>

303
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">or else I'm gonna do it.</font>

304
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting a lot
of attention, Eric.</font>

305
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our website's already
full of kids</font>

306
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">saying they feel
the same way as you</font>

307
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:42,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">and want to get help.</font>

308
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:43,743
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They</i> want to get help?
For what?</font>

309
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:46,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">For wanting to take
their own lives.</font>

310
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is about<i> me</i>
killing myself.</font>

311
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:52,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, babe, there's a lot of kids
who feel the same way you do.</font>

312
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're full of shit,
Heidi.</font>

313
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just trying
to get attention.</font>

314
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, are you actually talking
online to these asswipes?</font>

315
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought this was about raising
awareness and helping people.</font>

316
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're just gonna e-mail</font>

317
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:04,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">with every every guy
who has a dick and a deathwish?</font>

318
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:05,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we just your type?</font>

319
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, come on.
No, look, Heidi.</font>

320
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but you're the one
who started all this</font>

321
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">by telling everybody
that I was suicidal.</font>

322
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

323
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:14,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm under
a lot of pressure to do it.</font>

324
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the only option I have
is to make sure</font>

325
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">that suicide prevention
becomes this entire town's</font>

326
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:20,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">number-one priority!</font>

327
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, did you see</font>

328
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">what the President said
about Asians now?</font>

329
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:25,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out!</font>

330
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:30,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you freakin'
serious?</font>

331
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:37,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, babe,
what do you wanna ride first?</font>

332
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh!
What are we doing here, Craig?</font>

333
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get your mind
off politics and have some fun.</font>

334
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what's your
favorite ride?</font>

335
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:47,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ferris wheel!</font>

336
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:55,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't this lovely, Tweek?
Just look at that view.</font>

337
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

338
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another tweet
from the president!</font>

339
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

340
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why would the U.S. be scared
of North Korea?"</font>

341
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:06,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek is so not scared
he's at an amusement park</font>

342
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:08,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">"in Denver right now."</font>

344
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get outta here!</font>

345
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek!
Tweek, use your brain.</font>

346
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">North Korea isn't going
to attack an amusement park.</font>

347
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:18,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're safer here
than anywhere.</font>

348
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:20,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez.</font>

349
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The president just called
Kim Jong-un a fat midget.</font>

350
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and now North Korea
is saying that they're gonna...</font>

351
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, look out!</font>

352
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

358
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God,
what is that?</font>

359
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

360
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:50,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably nothing.
Everything's fine.</font>

361
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please stop
saying that?</font>

362
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:52,804

00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying
to make you feel better.</font>

364
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:57,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe I don't wanna
feel better right now!</font>

365
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but think about that.</font>

366
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">That actually doesn't make
any sense.</font>

367
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have to be
so logical?</font>

368
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need you
to problem-solve all the time,</font>

369
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to... Agh!
I don't know!</font>

00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:09,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, honey, all week,
you've been freaking out,</font>

371
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've been the one
forced to deal with it.</font>

372
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:12,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't been dealing
with it,</font>

373
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've been trying
to make it go away</font>

374
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">because my emotions
are freaking you out!</font>

375
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek, North Korea
isn't bombing anyone.</font>

376
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">They would lose
the support of China,</font>

377
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that would be...
There you go again!</font>

378
00:16:23,638 --> 00:16:25,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop preaching facts
to me!</font>

379
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not what I need!</font>

380
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sorry that
I'm actually in control</font>

381
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:31,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">of my goddamn emotions,
ya baby!</font>

382
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:34,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, see, now you made me lose
control of my emotions.</font>

383
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:35,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it.</font>

384
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:48,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Craig, how come
Tweek's not at school?</font>

385
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:49,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">How should I know?</font>

386
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.
Trouble in paradise?</font>

387
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look guys, Tweek doesn't
want help, okay?</font>

388
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just wants to overreact.</font>

389
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys,
could we have your attention?</font>

390
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow night, we'll be having
a memorial service</font>

391
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all the students we've lost
to distracted driving.</font>

392
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hope you can all bring
your families.</font>

393
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, yeah.
Hey, guys, and there's also</font>

394
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">gonna be a suicide awareness
pot luck</font>

395
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">at 7:30 tomorrow night
in the school gymnasium.</font>

396
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have lots of games
and face painting,</font>

397
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what are you guys
gonna have?</font>

398
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have
some guest speakers</font>

399
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:15,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">and also provide
grievance counselors</font>

400
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">for those who need it.</font>

401
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, grievance counseling...
That sounds super fun.</font>

402
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, guys,
there's a very real chance</font>

403
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might actually do it
right in front</font>

404
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">of everyone tomorrow,
so you don't want to miss it.</font>

405
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suicide prevention pot luck,
everybody.</font>

406
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, you need to stop.</font>

407
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they're doing is important.</font>

408
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're doing a memorial service
with speeches and crying.</font>

409
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:31,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that gonna solve?</font>

410
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not about
problem solving, Eric.</font>

411
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about people
getting together</font>

412
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">and feeling
what they need to feel!</font>

413
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:39,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">People need help sorting out
their emotions sometimes.</font>

414
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the best thing
isn't always quick answers,</font>

415
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just being there,
supporting each other.</font>

416
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:45,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And talking through
those feelings.</font>

417
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so up and down.</font>

418
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you want
from me, Heidi!</font>

419
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
There has to be a way.</font>

420
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:51,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can all work together,
here.</font>

421
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, now
you're on<i> their</i> side!</font>

422
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:56,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, I'm seriously
gonna do it right now!</font>

423
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric!</font>

424
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tweek!
What's going on?</font>

425
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:05,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What do you mean
what's going on?</font>

426
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same shit
that's been going on!</font>

427
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's gotten
any better?</font>

428
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God,
how does that make you feel?</font>

429
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel scared!
I feel alone!</font>

430
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">That must be horrible
to feel that way!</font>

431
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be hard for you
to even think!</font>

432
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:19,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is!
It's terrible!</font>

433
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:23,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet it's terrible!
What else are you feeling?</font>

434
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I have no control
over my life.</font>

435
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I'm just a pawn
in a big game.</font>

436
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:29,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's a terrifying
thought.</font>

437
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:30,829
