152
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I knew that guy
was a fucking chode.</font>

153
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy, what did you guys do
at that party?</font>

154
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothin'.</font>

155
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just hangin' out
and talkin' and stuff,</font>

156
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then Chip
got all weird.</font>

157
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">People were hurt!</font>

158
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I agree...
It's awful!</font>

159
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not like Chip, okay?
He's a bad witch!</font>

160
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did any of you guys
actually see the witch?</font>

161
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it was
terrifying.</font>

162
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had a broom
and a cackle and everything.</font>

163
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we
gonna do, guys?</font>

164
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our parents are never
gonna let us trick-or-treat</font>

165
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a witch
flying around!</font>

166
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say she blew up
the pumpkin patch.</font>

167
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did any of you guys
see that?</font>

168
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I missed
the whole thing.</font>

169
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always try to get to the
pumpkin patch really early.</font>

170
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I got there
early, too.</font>

171
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the best pumpkins
that way.</font>

172
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways, I guess the witch
destroyed the whole thing.</font>

173
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to take matters into our
own hands. None of us are safe.</font>

174
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but what
are we gonna do?</font>

175
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we got to just hope
the police will handle it.</font>

176
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah right, like they'll
handle anything.</font>

177
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan's right.
This might fall on us.</font>

178
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we got to
save Halloween.</font>

179
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you
think so, Eric?</font>

180
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

181
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to do something
to get rid of her!</font>

182
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
You're right, guys.</font>

183
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my only way out.</font>

184
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. See you, Sharon.
Have a good night!</font>

185
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think
<i>you're</i> going?</font>

186
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

187
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's day two of Witch Week
with the guys.</font>

188
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't possibly be
considering doing this again!</font>

189
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

190
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Randy a real with is flying around
in the sky snatching children!</font>

191
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:14,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think this is the best time for you
to be wearing a witch costume and partying.</font>

192
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. Gah! Just because
of one bad witch,</font>

193
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're supposed
to stop a tradition</font>

194
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">that goes back
twenty-some-odd years?</font>

195
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

196
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Randy.</font>

197
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Sup, guys?</font>

198
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, just getting
a bunch of shit</font>

199
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">for being witches.</font>

200
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, right?</font>

201
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like there's one awful witch
who wants to kill everybody,</font>

202
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">so now they're coming after
all of us!</font>

203
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is like
a witch... thingie.</font>

204
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a witch
pursuit thingie!</font>

205
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">A witch... uh...</font>

206
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a witch
chase and shoot 'em up!</font>

207
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's
what it is!</font>

208
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what the hell
is this?</font>

209
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Park closed
until further notice.</font>

210
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bullshit!</font>

211
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

212
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't do this.</font>

213
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole town really is
on a witch pursuit thing.</font>

214
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check this out,
you guys.</font>

215
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says that
to destroy a witch,</font>

216
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need bent pits,
nine in all,</font>

217
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">each bent into an "L" shape.</font>

218
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are bent pits?</font>

219
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys!
I think I got it figured out!</font>

220
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

221
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew Eric would come up
with a plan!</font>

222
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, first of all,
we need a scary place</font>

223
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">to lure her into.</font>

224
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the creepiest place
in town?</font>

225
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ross Dress for Less.
That's right.</font>

226
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan and Kyle will wait inside
the Ross Dress for Less</font>

227
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will
bring Heidi there.</font>

228
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once inside,
Kenny and Butters</font>

229
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">will set off a series
of explosions that will...</font>

230
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the
fuck are you talking about?</font>

231
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how we're going
to get rid of Heidi.</font>

232
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's talking about
getting rid of Heidi!</font>

233
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys said you would help me
get rid of her!</font>

234
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of the witch!</font>

235
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares about a witch?</font>

236
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">My life is a living hell,
you guys!</font>

237
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then break up with her!</font>

238
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">You clearly can't stand her.
Let the poor girl go!</font>

239
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've tried!
It's impossible!</font>

240
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi's a nice girl.
How can you be so awful to her?</font>

241
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand. She has no
time-management skills whatsoever.</font>

242
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know 'cause you've
never had a girlfriend, Kyle!</font>

243
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.
Just leave me to suffer.</font>

244
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you want me
to kill someone for you,</font>

245
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">just forget about it.</font>

246
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Students and parents,</font>

247
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that you are
all concerned about the witch</font>

248
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">who is preying upon our town.</font>

249
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want to speak to you all</font>

250
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,105

and protect yourselves.</font>

251
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first,</font>

252
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">some gentlemen
have asked to speak</font>

253
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">on what they perceive to be
a "witch pursuit thing."</font>

254
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, I'm supposed
to be actually over...</font>

255
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you go over
there, Stewart.</font>

256
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,754

Oh, hey, Eric.</font>

costume party tonight</font>

you and me should go.</font>

281
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">A costume party?
With everything that's going on?</font>

282
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I just think, you know,
we need to let off some steam</font>

283
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">and have a little Halloween fun,
you know?</font>

284
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already have our costumes
picked out.</font>

287
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,870

if you're bringing the costumes.</font>

288
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might need a little extra time
to get ready.</font>

289

291
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,048

About what we've done.</font>

294
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
it's time we come clean</font>

295
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell everyone
about the crack.</font>

296
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the spells
against our wives.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look,
you're freaked out.</font>

298
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's understandable.</font>

299
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to admit
what I've done wrong, Randy!</font>

300
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like
everything's crashing down</font>

301
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I want Linda to hear it
from me first.</font>

302
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we smoked
a little crack...</font>

303
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">We put harmless spells
on our wives.</font>

304
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were
just messing around.</font>

305
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was harmless fun!</font>

306
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it?</font>

307
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did we close our eyes to
what Chip Duncan was becoming?</font>

308
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stephen, you can't turn
on your own kind.</font>

309
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what these
witch pursuit thingies do, okay?</font>

310
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">They make everyone go crazy.</font>

311
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Randy.</font>

312
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to clear
my conscience.</font>

313
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Stephen.</font>

314
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least give us
till tomorrow morning</font>

315
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">to talk to our wives
and prepare them, all right?</font>

316
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you just give us
till morning?</font>

317
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sure.</font>

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

319
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

320
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it's Randy.</font>

321
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got until
tomorrow morning</font>

322
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sacrifice Stephen
to the devil.</font>

323
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll explain later,
just get everyone together.</font>

324
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe bring
just a little bit of crack.</font>

325
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think we should stay
on the main roads, Eric?</font>

326
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">This seems like
a bad place to be right now.</font>

327
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry Heidi, this is
the fastest way to the party.</font>

328
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure the witch
won't even notice us!</font>

329
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric, come on,
this is a bad idea.</font>

330
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's turn around.</font>

331
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Heidi,
if we'd been on<i> time</i></font>

332
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't need
to take a short cut,</font>

333
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I wanted to give you
your space to get ready.</font>

334
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that
what this is about?</font>

335
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still mad about
the pumpkin patch, aren't you?</font>

336
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I be mad?</font>

337
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to make sure
you looked right</font>

338
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then had to eat
and use the bathroom 40 times.</font>

339
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't blame<i> you</i> for missing
the pumpkin patch.</font>

340
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't use the bathroom
40 times!</font>

341
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that!</font>

342
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric! Did you hear that?</font>

343
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric?</font>

344
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric!</font>

345
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!
Eric, are you okay?</font>

346
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well,
what have we here?</font>

347
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet. Come on...
Come on...</font>

348
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, is your dad home?</font>

349
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I don't know where he is.</font>

350
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't find our dads
either!</font>

351
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and it turns out
our dads and the bad witch</font>

352
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">were all part of the same witch group!
We asked our moms,</font>

353
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they said this has been
going on for years.</font>

354
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta find them before
something even stupider happens.</font>

355
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we gonna do that?
There's another guy.</font>

356
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone else who was
in the witch's club</font>

357
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">but hasn't been around for a while.
Who?</font>

358
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. President,</font>

359
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have an urgent call
from a Butters Stotch.</font>

360
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters?
What's he want?</font>

361
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the President.</font>

362
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, hello,
Mr. President, how are you?</font>

363
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butter him up,
Butters.</font>

364
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">How... How is running
the country goin'?</font>

365
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's fine. You know, just
making the country great again.</font>

366
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get rid of all
the immigrants like you said?</font>

367
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got rid of, like,
six of 'em so far...</font>

368
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it's little harder
than I thought.</font>

369
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool, and did you build that
big wall you were gonna build?</font>

370
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be a dick, Butters.</font>

371
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you just calling
to shit on my Halloween?</font>

372
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir!
I... Well, the thing is...</font>

373
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you used to do J and C
Witch Week with our dads?</font>

374
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it was
my favorite time of year.</font>

375
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I just have to
celebrate it alone.</font>

376
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the thing is,
Mr. President,</font>

377
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of the guys did a spell</font>

378
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">and took a bunch of children
and he's gonna eat 'em all.</font>

379
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lemme guess...
Chip Duncan.</font>

380
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that guy
was always such a douche.</font>

381
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. President,
please, you gotta help.</font>

382
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our dads can't do anything
'cause they're scared</font>

383
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">people are coming
after<i> all</i> witches.</font>

384
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming after<i> all</i> witches?</font>

385
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, geez...</font>

386
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you were there
when witch showed up</font>

387
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">and took your girlfriend?</font>

388
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it just came
outta nowhere.</font>

389
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to save Heidi,
but it was too late.</font>

390
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was your girlfriend
wearing?</font>

391
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was dressed kinda like me</font>

392
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">but had a simple
Munich dirndl from Germany.</font>

393
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you didn't stop at all</font>

394
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">to think that what you were
doing might attract the witch?</font>

395
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

396
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you actually trying
to blame the victim here?</font>

397
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying that if
there's a big fat witch around,</font>

398
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe you shouldn't
walk through the woods</font>

399
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">dressed
as Hansel and Gretel.</font>

400
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohhh!</font>

401
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Not cool, Rick.
Not cool!</font>

402
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have your badge, sir!</font>

403
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, folks, sorry.</font>

404
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective! Detective!
Call just came in.</font>

405
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">The witch has been spotted
at Ross Dress for Less!</font>

406
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone to
Ross Dress for Less now!</font>

407
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?
I'm here...</font>

408
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys?</font>

409
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this all about?</font>

410
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Stephen.</font>

411
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey.
What are we meeting here for?</font>

412
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:26,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late, Stephen.
We called the police.</font>

413
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know
you took those children.</font>

414
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
What... What are you doing?</font>

415
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is, everybody!</font>

416
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stephen's a bad witch!</font>

417
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

418
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're putting a stop to you,
Stephen!</font>

419
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's
what good witches do!</font>

420
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
I see what this is.</font>

421
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">This witch pursuit thing has<i> you</i>
on a witch pursuit thing now!</font>

422
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm innocent! Please!</font>

423
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over, Stotch!</font>

424
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done
with the children?</font>

425
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't you see?</font>

426
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just doing their own
witch pursuit thingy now.</font>

427
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is madness!</font>

428
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wassup, bros?</font>

429
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wassup bros"?</font>

430
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chip, do you see
all the chaos you've caused?</font>

431
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so? I'm a witch.</font>

432
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand</font>

433
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone associates us
with you, right?</font>

434
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course they do.
You're all witches too, dudes!</font>

435
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like you!</font>

436
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you do
with the children?</font>

437
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all in here!
See?</font>

438
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!</font>

439
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to use their souls
to increase my power!</font>

440
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look! Another witch
is flying down now!</font>

441
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, come on!
We got to go!</font>

442
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay! Where?</font>

443
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess our witches were gonna
