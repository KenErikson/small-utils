00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just sit down, Bob!</font>

151
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just sayin'!
I'm just sayin'!</font>

152
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, everyone.
I have a team right now</font>

153
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's trying to locate
the president,</font>

154
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd like you to hear
from Officer Bright,</font>

155
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's leading the search.</font>

156
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, folks.
We know you're all concerned,</font>

157
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I want to assure you that we
are doing everything we can</font>

158
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">to track the president down
and have him safely removed.</font>

159
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the president was given
a splatty tomato,</font>

160
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's become very desperate
and very dangerous.</font>

161
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you see the president,
do not approach him.</font>

162
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not try
to reason with him.</font>

163
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most importantly, remember
that this<i> is</i> the president,</font>

164
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you cannot shoot him.
All right?</font>

165
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't even talk
about shooting him.</font>

166
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even...</font>

167
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">do any coy satirical takes
on shooting him.</font>

168
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, good.</font>

169
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we're trying to do here</font>

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">is just get the president
to go away.</font>

171
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna be handing out
padlocks like this one</font>

172
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">so everyone can lock up
their garbage.</font>

173
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't feed the president,
hopefully he'll just move on.</font>

174
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are there any questions?</font>

175
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we talk about
a friend shooting him</font>

176
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it's in a sort of
a sarcastic way?</font>

177
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
Now, it's - it's just best</font>

178
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">to avoid that kind of talk
altogether.</font>

179
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember,
they can do to you</font>

180
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">what they did
to Kathy Griffin.</font>

181
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made her not funny
for 30 years?</font>

182
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

183
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">So best thing is just
lock up your garbage</font>

184
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see if we can get
the president to go away.</font>

185
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

186
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now kids
are going missing.</font>

187
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all
gonna be missing soon!</font>

188
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kyle!</font>

189
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fault.</font>

190
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ike went to go take matters
into his own hands.</font>

191
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to find him.</font>

192
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll help you.</font>

193
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll all help you.</font>

194
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this could be
really dangerous.</font>

195
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going.</font>

196
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised tonight
we'd have a date night.</font>

197
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darling, this is a little
more pressing than date night.</font>

198
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, great.</font>

199
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Kyle's stupid brother
goes missing, and I get fucked.</font>

200
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">How come I'm always the one
getting shit on around here?</font>

201
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need anyone
to go with me.</font>

202
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what's the matter,
Kyle?</font>

203
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't want me around
because you had the hots for me</font>

204
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I shut you down?</font>

205
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never have the hots
for the person you are now.</font>

206
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you guys.</font>

207
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we all know what
we're supposed to do now.</font>

208
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all saw "It"
and "Stranger Things."</font>

209
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get our backpacks
and go out to woods</font>

210
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">and save the town from evil
to some kick-ass '80s' music!</font>

211
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, joining us
for lunch today?</font>

212
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yes.</font>

213
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are here with
our student of the day</font>

214
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">to reward him lunch</font>

215
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the principal
and vice principal.</font>

216
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have
a reservation.</font>

217
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, last name?</font>

218
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Woman.</font>

219
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">First name.</font>

220
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strong.</font>

221
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, Strong Woman,
here we are.</font>

222
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a nice booth
set up for you.</font>

223
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't
keep doing this.</font>

224
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are gonna
see through it.</font>

225
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it my fault
that I found</font>

226
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most amazing, perfect,
beautiful woman...</font>

227
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">at work?</font>

228
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody
will understand.</font>

229
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they will.</font>

230
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're co-workers
who are in love.</font>

231
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really that's
going to bother people?</font>

232
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, should we
order now?</font>

233
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
doing, Bob?</font>

234
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

235
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been putting food out
for the president?</font>

236
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was just, uh,</font>

237
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">taking these finger sandwiches
to the trash.</font>

238
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all agreed not to feed him
so he'd go away.</font>

239
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't all agree!
<i>You</i> all agreed!</font>

240
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody asked the Whites
how they felt!</font>

241
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cares what the Whites
have to say!</font>

242
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bob, come on.</font>

243
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to know it's not safe
to have him here.</font>

244
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">In 2003,
Hillary Clinton admitted</font>

245
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">to taking funds

<font color="#FFFFFF">from foreign diplomats!</font>

247
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that got to do
with anything, Bob? Come on.</font>

248
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fucking true!</font>

249
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bob, if Canada finds out
the president is hiding here,</font>

250
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:54,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">they are going
to nuke us.</font>

251
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to go.</font>

252
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:59,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hillary wouldn't have been
any better.</font>

253
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me
the finger sandwiches.</font>

254
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine!</font>

255
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and take
the White's sandwiches!</font>

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm breaking up with you.</font>

448
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, don't be
ridiculous.</font>

449
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been ridiculous.</font>

450
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:49,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to learn to stop
feeling sorry for myself.</font>

451
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, you are not
breaking up with me.</font>

452
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.
It's over.</font>

453
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I can't let you
do that, sweetheart!</font>

454
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step back!
I'll do it! I swear to God!</font>

455
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not gonna work
this time, Eric.</font>

456
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">You break up with me,
I will kill myself!</font>

457
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The choice
is yours, Heidi!</font>

458
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everybody!</font>

459
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Eric,
we don't want you to die."</font>

460
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

461
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can be the victim.</font>

462
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

463
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi!</font>

464
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, I'm gonna do it!
Here we go!</font>

465
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi?
Are you seriously...</font>

466
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">He broke free.</font>

467
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">The president
is on the loose again.</font>

468
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:28,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be
even more desperate now.</font>

469
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to get worse.</font>

470
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't destroy him,
can we?</font>

471
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

472
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess...</font>

473
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's up to the Whites.</font>

474
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would want to put
their penis in a co-worker?</font>
