00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever has
the best Hummel collection</font>

150
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">is top bitch in this place,
and she's got the best.</font>

151
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's ruthless, and she
has those old lady farts.</font>

152
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
old lady farts, right?</font>

153
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they're so loose</font>

154
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't even acknowledge
they happened?</font>

155
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello,
Mr. Marsh.</font>

156
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Mrs. McGullicutty.
How are you feeling today?</font>

157
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing very well.</font>

158
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have they given you Percocet
for that knee of yours?</font>

159
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, yeah, here.
I just got it.</font>

160
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

161
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you'd almost think</font>

162
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were trying
to keep them from me.</font>

163
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, ma'am?</font>

164
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandpa actually
really needs those drugs.</font>

165
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in a lot of pain.</font>

166
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, and who is
this little rascal?</font>

167
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just my grandson.
He... He's worthless.</font>

168
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">How sweet.</font>

169
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm? Coming to visit
your old papa</font>

170
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the joint, huh?</font>

171
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love your papa,
don't you?</font>

172
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd hate to see him suffer
even more than he already is.</font>

173
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You watch
your ass, Marsh,</font>

174
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll have you
sent to the quiet room.</font>

175
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh... What is she talking about?
What's the quiet room?</font>

176
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you... She has
all the pull in here.</font>

177
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go against what she says,
you end up in solitaire.</font>

178
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, please!
I-I didn't do anything!</font>

179
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right,
Mr. Standish.</font>

180
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just need
a little quiet time.</font>

181
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
how to play solitaire! Please!</font>

182
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that, today,
they are performing</font>

183
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?</font>

184
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh the kid's
party performer, yeah.</font>

185
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a concerned member
of the public,</font>

186
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish to be present.</font>

187
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, sorry, children aren't
really allowed in autopsies.</font>

188
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I shall wait here
to learn the coroner's findings!</font>

189
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toxicology report
shows subject</font>

190
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">had massive amounts of opioids
in system at time of death.</font>

191
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now proceeding.</font>

192
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have these
put in the garbage.</font>

193
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you find,
coroner?</font>

194
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this?</font>

195
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is an epidemic
in our community, sir!</font>

196
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of us actually
care to confront the problem.</font>

197
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, damn it,
what did you find?</font>

198
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing out of the ordinary.</font>

199
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subject died
of a simple overdose.</font>

200
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found nothing else
except for two Hummels</font>

201
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the subject's
rectal cavity.</font>

202
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hummels?
In his rectal cavity, you say,</font>

203
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you do not find this
'out of the ordinary'?</font>

204
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all.</font>

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've found Hummels
in nearly all</font>

206
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">the birthday entertainer's
anal cavities.</font>

207
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very common
in our overdose victims.</font>

208
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm...</font>

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit too common,
don't you think?</font>

210
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, why does grandpa
have to be in the nursing home?</font>

211
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't he
live with us again?</font>

212
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, grandpa has
a lot of needs</font>

213
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we can't
provide him here.</font>

214
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs professional
supervision.</font>

215
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really it?
Because I-I just feel</font>

216
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">like we kind of
threw grandpa away</font>

217
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forgot about him.</font>

218
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

219
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
how much money we pay</font>

220
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">to have grandpa
in that place?</font>

221
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your grandpa
is styling.</font>

222
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you imagine being able
to just sit around all day</font>

223
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not have to do anything
but eat and watch TV?</font>

224
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'd probably go crazy
and want to kill myself.</font>

225
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, Stan, it's not like
he's in jail.</font>

226
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's kind of
like jail.</font>

227
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should go visit him.</font>

228
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

229
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm too busy
busting my ass</font>

230
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">to pay the bills
for that place</font>

231
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to pay for
<i>your</i> guitar lessons.</font>

232
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have
guitar lessons.</font>

233
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to go there.
It's depressing.</font>

234
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, you tricked me.</font>

235
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

236
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude! Did you give Butters
a crochet pillow to drop off?</font>

237
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude,
I don't have a choice.</font>

238
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to get the Hummels
for my grandpa.</font>

239
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you need
to get Hummels</font>

240
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">without making Butters
a drug dealer.</font>

241
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drug dealer?</font>

242
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he-hey, Marcus.</font>

280
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you've become</font>

281
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">quite the Hummel collector
lately.</font>

282
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the fascination
with Hummels?</font>

283
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. I... Look, I just
really like Hummels, okay?</font>

284
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just...
I'm really into Hummels.</font>

285
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. I see.
So then you should be able</font>

286
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">to tell me what
<i>this</i> Hummel is called.</font>

287
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">That... That's, uh...</font>

288
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!
If you're a Hummel expert,</font>

289
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you should
know it's name!</font>

290
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... It's
Whistling in the Rain.</font>

291
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong!
It's called Stormy Weather.</font>

292
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where it was found?
No.</font>

293
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:28,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was found deep in the anus
of one Chuck E. Cheese,</font>

00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">the renowned entertainer
beloved by millions!</font>

295
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you know something
about the epidemic</font>

296
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is killing artists,
then you better cough it up.</font>

297
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus, trust me, you don't
want to get involved.</font>

298
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I<i> became</i> involved
when Chuck E. Cheese</font>

299
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">collapsed like a rag doll
before my very eyes!</font>

300
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had any involvement,
I will bring you down!</font>

301
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was really great
seeing you, Dad.</font>

302
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we oughta
hit the road soon.</font>

303
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You finally come to visit
and leave after 10 minutes.</font>

304
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus, now we know</font>

305
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Stan gets
his guilt trips from.</font>

306
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmmm.</font>

307
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems somebody's been
a little naughty lately.</font>

308
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mrs. McGullicutty,</font>

309
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:13,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">how are you?</font>

310
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmmm.</font>

311
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">My, what a lovely
Hummel collection</font>

312
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're starting
to amass.</font>

313
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:26,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost smells brand new,
doesn't it?</font>

314
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like it was purchased
right from the factory.</font>

315
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, and who are
these lovely people?</font>

316
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family that came to visit,
no doubt?</font>

317
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Yeah, we love coming here.</font>

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, family.</font>

319
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember
when I was a little girl.</font>

320
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother used to play
such tricks on me.</font>

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to fool me.</font>

322
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to get out
from his responsibilities.</font>

323
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm giving you Hummels.</font>

324
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it matter
where they come from?</font>

325
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

326
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter to<i> me,</i>
but it matters to them.</font>

327
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">The big guys.</font>

328
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, what they want is
more people who are addicted.</font>

329
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">To crochet pillows.</font>

330
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it?</font>

331
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you fine folks.</font>

332
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're never
visiting here again.</font>

333
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, ho!
You're dead, Butters!</font>

334
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,129

<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys!
Guys, I need your help!</font>

336
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,131

with your heroin operation,</font>

337
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">count us out.</font>

338
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just talked to my grandpa.

340
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stan, we told you
we don't want to be involved.</font>

341
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,475

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get outta the way,
dude!</font>

345
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know what to do!</font>

346
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever has the best Hummels
controls the nursing home.</font>

347
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta steal this lady's
Hummel collection</font>

348
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and give it
to my grandpa.</font>

349
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, Stan, even
if we<i> wanted</i> to help you,</font>

350
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">which we don't,
there's no way.</font>

351
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can sneak into
an old folks home,</font>

352
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">distract
all the old people,</font>

354
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, there totally is
a way you could do that.</font>

355
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? What... What is it,
Cartman?</font>

356
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, we're not
getting involved!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! Don't let anyone
near Peppa Pig until I arrive!</font>

365
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,389

Let me through!</font>

366
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, Peppa.
Peppa, can you hear me?</font>

367
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Marcus Preston.
Can you understand me?</font>

368
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get
the drugs, Peppa?</font>

369
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it from Stan Marsh?</font>

370
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, man,
what you talkin' 'bout?</font>

371
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me
a fucking ambulance.</font>

372
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh!
Peppa, focus.</font>

373
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon you'll be
in Heaven,</font>

374
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">jumping in all the muddy puddles
you can imagine,</font>

375
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">but first,
you must tell me...</font>

376
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do the Hummels go,
Peppa?</font>

377
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let us through.
Get away, kids.</font>

378
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peppa, now!
Why Hummels?</font>

379
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to squeal!</font>

380
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old people!</font>

381
