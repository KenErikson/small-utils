the Special Ed Science Fair!</font>

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,183

- Science fair!</font>

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right! The Science Fair
is this weekend,</font>

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know you are all
<i>very</i> excited to show</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the projects
you've been working on!</font>

18

Science Fair!</font>

19
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">This week, we'll be hearing</font>

20
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">all about your projects,</font>

21
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,395

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan and Mimallah.</font>

23
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">For our science fair project,</font>

24
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">we will be showing
the destructive force</font>

25
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,640

a volcano!</font>

of Mount Kilauea!</font>

31
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:31,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our science fair project
is sure to be a blast.</font>

32
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it? A blast.</font>

33
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what do you
guys think of Nathan</font>

34
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Mimallah's
project idea?</font>

35
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yay!
- Yay!</font>

36
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've done it, Mimsey.</font>

37
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna win
the science fair for sure.</font>

38
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then every chick
in this school</font>

39
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">is gonna want to have
sex with us.</font>

40
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gee, boss, I don't know
about sex with no chicken.</font>

41
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not<i> those</i> chicks, numbskull.</font>

42
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking about bitches.</font>

43
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what girls like?
They like winners.</font>

44
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when we win
the science fair,</font>

45
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna be up to our ears
in pussy.</font>

46
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it just me,
or are things around here</font>

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting worse and worse?</font>

48
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's definitely
not just you.</font>

49
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think everyone's is shock
that Heidi went back to Cartman.</font>

50
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">What keeps driving her
back to him?</font>

51
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:14,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so weird.</font>

52
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's so...</font>

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mean and angry these days.</font>

54
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">People change.
They say you become</font>

55
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">more and more like
the person you're with,</font>

56
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I guess it's
true with Heidi.</font>

57
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey guys, wassup?</font>

58
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Heidi.</font>

59
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys
talking about?</font>

60
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

61
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullcrap, you're all</font>

62
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about me again!</font>

63
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause you're
judgmental bitches.</font>

64
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh.</font>

65
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi...</font>

66
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

67
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just...
You look...</font>

68
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look what?</font>

69
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
you just look...</font>

70
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, I look fat?</font>

71
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you wanna
say, Wendy?</font>

72
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you, bitch.</font>

73
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's just concerned,
Heidi.</font>

74
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meh, myeh,
meh, meh, meh, Heidi.</font>

75
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying
to enjoy my lunch here.</font>

76
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I do it without you guys
shitting all over me?</font>

77
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right good,
Timmy.</font>

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Test 42-A is successful!</font>

79
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move on
to the next phase.</font>

80
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello, gentlemen.</font>

81
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, fellas.
We're doing great.</font>

82
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timmy!</font>

83
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought we'd stop by
to see how</font>

84
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">your science fair project
was going.</font>

85
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we was comin'
to rub their faces</font>

86
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">in how good<i> our</i> science
fair project was, boss!</font>

87
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Mimsey!</font>

88
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what are
you guys working on?</font>

89
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's fantastic.</font>

90
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">This year, Tim-Tim and I</font>

91
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">are doing our project
on water bears!</font>

92
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh, water bears.</font>

93
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that Mimsey?</font>

94
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like there's any such thing
as water bears.</font>

95
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">That blue Science Fair Ribbon
is as good as ours.</font>

96
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we gotta get back to
our lava volcano.</font>

97
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck finding your
water bears.</font>

98
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, would you like
to see them?</font>

99
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha? What are you
talking about?</font>

100
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timmy and I have gathered
thousands of water bears.</font>

101
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look into
the microscope.</font>

102
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:49,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water bears are water-dwelling,
eight legged micro-animals.</font>

103
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Timmy!
They are one of nature's</font>

104
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">most resilient animals.</font>

105
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Studies have shown
they can survive lava</font>

106
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even the vacuum of space.</font>

107
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... How...</font>

108
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the fuck did you
learn about these things?</font>

109
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where all good scientists
learn from... Octonauts.</font>

110
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Octonauts!</font>

111
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some scientists believe
the study of water bears</font>

112
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">is key to human survival.</font>

113
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, gee, that sounds
a lot better than</font>

114
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lava volcano,
huh, boss?</font>

115
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well not really,</font>

116
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">because a science fair
is supposed to be an experiment.</font>

117
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fail to see what
the experiment is here.</font>

118
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's easy! You see,
for the past several weeks,</font>

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tim-Tim and me have
been training the water bears</font>

120
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">to respond to different
sound waves.</font>

121
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've found that they respond
best to Taylor Swift.</font>

122
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit it, Timmy. ♪ Oh, look
what you made me do ♪</font>

123
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look!</font>

128
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still have some
training to do,</font>

129
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we're excited
about the results.</font>

130
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to admit your lava
volcano is pretty great, too!</font>

131
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we could tie
for first place.</font>

132
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

133
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to see me,
Mr. Mackey?</font>

134
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, Heidi! Uh,</font>

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">we just wanted to see
if you have transportation</font>

136
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the Special Ed Science Fair
this weekend or if you wanted us</font>

137
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">to set something up for you.</font>

138
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

139
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Saturday
is the science fair,</font>

140
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you're the judge
for the competition.</font>

141
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judge a special needs
science fair?</font>

142
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, no, thanks.</font>

143
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Heidi is there a problem</font>

144
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">with you being the judge
this weekend?</font>

145
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, it's Saturday,
and I don't wanna be at skewl.</font>

146
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're always the judge
of the Special Ed Science Fair</font>

147
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're
our best science student.</font>

148
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, now I'm gonna be punished
by being forced to judge</font>

149
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bunch
of handicapped kids?</font>

150
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... M'kay. You see
the problem is that</font>

151
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">you volunteered last month,
Heidi.</font>

152
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you wanted to do it,
M'kay.</font>

153
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how can you
expect students to commit</font>

154
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">to things a month
in advance?</font>

155
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know what
I want for dinner<i> tonight!</i></font>

156
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the kids have
worked really hard</font>

157
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">and have done some
amazing projects.</font>

158
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna force me to
come to skew on a Saturday?</font>

159
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi...</font>

160
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything all right?</font>

161
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what are you gonna
call me fat now, too?</font>

162
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just so happens
I'm a vegan!</font>

163
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means it's difficult
for me to get enough protein</font>

164
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">so my body doesn't burn fat,
it burns muscle,</font>

165
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">which makes it<i> look</i> like
I'm fat, but I'm actually</font>

166
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">way healthier than any of you!</font>

167
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, you're judging
the Special Ed Science Fair</font>

168
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">this weekend.</font>

169
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, God damn it!</font>

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mimsey! Come on!</font>

171
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Nathan!</font>

172
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shhhhh!
Shut the fuck up!</font>

173
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gee, we could get in
a lot a trouble.</font>

174
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-you sure we should mess
with Jimmy and Timmy's</font>

175
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">science fair project?</font>

176
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mimsey, do you know
what Jimmy is?</font>

177
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a cockblocker.</font>

178
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arr, what's a cockblocker?</font>

179
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I come up a way
to score with the ladies,</font>

180
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's Jimmy
trying to one-up me.</font>

181
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">This science fair is
supposed to finally make us</font>

182
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">successful enough
to get chicks.</font>

183
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, gee, I don't know
if we should use</font>

184
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">our position of power
to exploit women.</font>

185
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not letting those assholes
win the science fair.</font>

186
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I say...</font>

187
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only good water bears
are dead water bears.</font>

188
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

189
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bullcrap!</font>

190
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can they<i> force</i> me to be
the science fair judge?</font>

191
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I know how it feels
to be a slave!</font>

192
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... not exactly like
being a slave, Heidi.</font>

193
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is! Am I being paid
to judge the science fair?</font>

194
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

195
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I have a choice?
No.</font>

196
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, yes, massa!</font>

197
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lemme judge that science fair
for ya, sir!</font>

198
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, will you<i> stop?</i></font>

199
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theresa, don't get all aggro
on me because you're pissed off</font>

200
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're family
lives in a trailer.</font>

201
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">My family doesn't live
in a trailer.</font>

202
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">We live in a tiny home!
My parents downsized</font>

203
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make a smaller footprint
on the environment.</font>

204
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I said... your
family lives in a trailer.</font>

205
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's lots of progressive
people living in tiny homes.</font>

206
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's five others
on our block!</font>

207
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.
That's called a trailer<i> park.</i></font>

208
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't live in
a trailer park!</font>

209
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't even
respond to her.</font>

210
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ignore her.</font>

211
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try, but she's
such a bitch.</font>

212
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't talking
to you, Heidi.</font>

213
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Looks like Isla has
something to say, you guys!</font>

214
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, I'm sure this is
going to be really profound.</font>

215
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, Isla, knock us out
with your wit and satire.</font>

216
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">This should be good,
you guys!</font>

217
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Heidi!
What's up?</font>

218
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, babe,
what's going on?</font>

219
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you up to?</font>

220
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing just talking to my
girlfriends about tiny homes.</font>

221
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello there,
ladies.</font>

222
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hi, Nathan.</font>

223
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just wanted to
remind you that this weekend</font>

224
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the Special Ed
Science Fair.</font>

225
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cool.</font>

226
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's right.</font>

227
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty sure you'll all be
impressed with what you see.</font>

228
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope you can make it.</font>

229
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see that,
Mimsey?</font>

230
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way those girls
bit their bottom lips</font>

231
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I said Science Fair?</font>

232
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're about to be
drowning in muff.</font>

233
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan, Mimallah!
You gotta get to Special Ed!</font>

234
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Special Ed class
isn't for another two hours.</font>

235
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no!
You gotta see this!</font>

236
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy and Timmy's
water bears!</font>

237
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've changed!</font>

238
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

239
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa!
- Ooooh!</font>

240
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So cool!
- I can't believe it.</font>

241
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy and Timmy,
this is incredible!</font>

242
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've somehow made them
even smarter!</font>

243
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

244
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan!
It's amazing!</font>

245
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water bears we've
trained are starting</font>

246
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">to display
social advancements!</font>

247
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're supposed
to be dead!</font>

248
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof!</font>

249
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">What social advancements?</font>

250
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've actually evolved
to the point of doing</font>

258
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys, this might be
the single greatest.</font>

How would you like to be the judge</font>

262
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,706

this weekend?</font>

263
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I can't.</font>

264
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,143

<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, don't be a dick!</font>

266
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah don't
make up excuses</font>

267
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">because judging handicapped
students sounds terrible.</font>

268

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Butters. God!</font>

269

It's<i> my</i> birthday party.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then could you
invite Heidi, please?</font>

271
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs an excuse
not to have to go to</font>

them, they're our friends?</font>

274
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because nobody wants
to be trapped in a gym</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's total bullshit!</font>

298
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Uh, babe I understand
that you're pissed off,</font>

299
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, um, you know,
it<i> is</i> recess.</font>

300
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should relax
and have some fun.</font>

301
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax?
How can I relax?</font>

302
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get straight A's!
I ace every test!</font>

303
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who gets
all the support?</font>

304
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Special Ed
department!</font>

305
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Bring it on in.</font>

306
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">These kids need
to have access</font>

307
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">to everything
they need.</font>

308
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, look at this,
Tim Tim.</font>

309
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've all been researching
water bears, too!</font>

310
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's correct.</font>

311
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you,
we've come to realize</font>

312
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">that water bears are
the the key to our future.</font>

313
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are these
the special water bears</font>

314
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">we read about
on your school message board?</font>

315
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

316
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water bears
we've been working with</font>

317
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">appear to be evolving
somehow.</font>

318
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they are the key
to our survival, boys.</font>

319
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, perhaps I can
interest you in a lava volcano.</font>

320
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't believe
your eyes</font>

321
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I add
some simple baking soda.</font>

322
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time for that.</font>

323
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need everyone working
on Jimmy and Timmy's project.</font>

324
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna let you kids all in
on a little secret.</font>

325
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want
to create a panic,</font>

326
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the end
is very near...</font>

327
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we have
very little time.</font>

328
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellow students,</font>

329
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have asked
to speak today</font>

330
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the hypocrisy
and bullying</font>

331
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is coming
from the administration</font>

332
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">at this so-called skewl.</font>

333
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is an outrage that
our principal and counselors</font>

334
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">demand our participation
in frivolous programs</font>

335
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">that are outrageously
overfunded.</font>

336
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it that
the school allows funding</font>

337
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">that only goes
to special-needs students?</font>

338
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the rest of us
not special?</font>

339
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we are continually asked
to work for no money</font>

340
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ask our parents
to pay for our programs,</font>

341
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">then soon
we will all be poor</font>

342
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forced to live
in a trailer park, like Theresa.</font>

343
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a<i> trailer!</i></font>

344
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theresa, get over it.</font>

345
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live in a trailer park.
It's not a big deal.</font>

346
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, o-okay, honey.</font>

347
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kind of getting
off topic, sweetie.</font>

348
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

349
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just... I just want you
to stay on point</font>

350
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can
get this over with.</font>

351
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Get this over with"?</font>

352
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed
to be supporting me!</font>

353
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I<i> am</i> supporting you,
sweetheart.</font>

354
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being supportive doesn't mean
you criticize me, asshole!</font>

355
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just forget it!</font>

356
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">My point is,
if the school administration</font>

357
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't cancel
the science fair,</font>

358
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will see to it
that they are all fired</font>

359
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">for discrimination!</font>

360
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's kind of
like Cartman</font>

361
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">but with the ability
to follow through.</font>

362
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dude.
Bro.</font>

363
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Francis, could you hand me
the sound-wave generator?</font>

364
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bullshit.</font>

365
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Special Ed Science Fair
is turning into a love-fest</font>

366
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Jimmy
and Timmy's project.</font>

367
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna get
all the fame and glory.</font>

368
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess we kind of shot
ourselves in the foot, huh, boss?</font>

369
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for us,
those water bears</font>

370
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">wouldn't have even gotten
smarter in the first place.</font>

371
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mimsey.
That's right.</font>

372
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't deserve
the credit.</font>

373
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,383
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We</i> do.</font>

374
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me.</font>

375
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're all trying
to figure out</font>

376
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">why these water bears
are different,</font>

377
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're talking
to the wrong guy.</font>

378
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh-What do you mean,
Nathan?</font>

379
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mimsey and I did
some experimenting</font>

380
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the water bears
on our own...</font>

381
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">We was tryin'
to kill 'em!</font>

382
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was us
who made them evolve.</font>

383
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we should be the ones
working for the government.</font>

384
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">The government?</font>

385
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-We aren't
the government.</font>

386
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y-You're not
the government?</font>

387
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you said you were here
to help stop us</font>

388
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">from becoming extinct.</font>

389
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you,<i> us.</i></font>

390
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're with... the NFL.</font>

391
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our fans are leaving
at an exponential rate.</font>

392
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been hit
with anthem protests,</font>

393
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">protests
to those protests,</font>

394
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, worse of all,
concussions.</font>

395
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more reports
that come out,</font>

396
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more people are getting
turned off by football.</font>

00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,538

with water bears to see how</font>

401
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,207

to concussions.</font>

402

446
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you all
fail to understand</font>

447
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">the seriousness
of our situation...</font>

448
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,499

449
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.</font>

450
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close the door!
Everyone back to work.</font>

451
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody will stop
this Special Ed Science Fair!</font>

00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do what he says!</font>

453

<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! Okay!
Jesus Christ!</font>

454
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you just gonna stand there?
Do something!</font>

455
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
do you want<i> me</i> to do?</font>

456
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you
to have some balls</font>

457
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">and act like
you care about me!</font>

458
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, you need to stop
being such a bitch!</font>

459
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me
a "bitch" again.</font>

460
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

461
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me
a "bitch" again.</font>

462
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are... acting...
like a... bad girlfriend.</font>

463
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I thought!</font>

464
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait a minute!</font>

465
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water bears
have changed again.</font>

466
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's working.</font>

467
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see that!</font>

468
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!
Yes, they're starting to adapt!</font>

469
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch. We just might
have ourselves some fans.</font>

470
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, quickly, children.</font>

471
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must replicate these
water bears to create more!</font>

472
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">If nobody else is gonna
do anything, I will!</font>

473
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha...</font>

474
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water bears!</font>

475
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get her!
- Stop her!</font>

476
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's over here!</font>

477
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi! Heidi,
will you please listen to me?</font>

478
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it!</font>

479
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck
outta the way!</font>

480
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said get outta the way,
you assholes!</font>

481
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get her!
- She's over here!</font>

482
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got the fat girl.</font>

483
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Front of the school.</font>

484
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

485
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little girl, stop.</font>

486
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't have to end
this way.</font>

487
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move aside!
Move aside!</font>

488
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, seriously...</font>

489
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need
to listen to me.</font>

490
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't... have to listen...</font>

491
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">to anybody.</font>

492
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes, you do.</font>

493
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to listen.</font>

494
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

495
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fuck you.</font>

496
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little girl, please.</font>

497
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you have in your hand
is very special.</font>

498
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sick of everyone
treating me like shit.</font>

499
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about the NFL...</font>

500
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much joy
it brings everyone.</font>

501
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't listen to them.
Give the water bears to me.</font>

502
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserve all the fame
and bitches.</font>

503
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heidi, you gotta stop
being so angry.</font>

504
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you... if you don't
do it for the NFL,</font>

505
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">what about humanity?</font>

506
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those creatures are showing
the first signs of sentience.</font>

507
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about what they could
mean for science,</font>

508
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">for medicine,
making people better.</font>

509
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, babe.</font>

510
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all want
the old Heidi back.</font>

511
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw all you guys.</font>

512
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

513
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude. Wow.</font>

514
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there something
you wanna talk about?</font>

515
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was just
trying to figure out</font>

516
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you decided to drink
20,000 micro animals</font>

517
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">that were showing
signs of intelligence.</font>

518
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever. It's Saturday,
and I'm not in school.</font>

519
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're... you're
not in school.</font>

520
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">How come we never
snuggle anymore?</font>

521
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh-What?</font>

522
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">We used to snuggle
all the time,</font>

523
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's totally
gone away.</font>

524
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happened?</font>

525
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, bunny, we still...
Snuggle!</font>

526
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, let's... let's
snuggle, yes.</font>

527
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!
How come there's nothing</font>

528
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">to watch on Saturday
but kids' cartoons?</font>

529
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All right, kids!
Now let's do the hokey pokey!</i></font>

530
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,656
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>♪ You put your left foot in,

Ooh.</font>

533
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on

534
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.
What<i> is</i> going on in nya?</font>

535
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel something

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahp...</font>

537
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ew.</font>

538
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snuggle!</font>

539
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Okay, honey.</font>

540
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agh. Ugh.</font>

541
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

542
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have any luck,
Mr. Jones?</font>

543
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid, Commissioner,
that the Special Ed Science Fair</font>

544
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">failed to produce
more viable water bears.</font>

545
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the NFL
truly has no hope.</font>

546
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done for.</font>

547
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not quite.</font>

548
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were able to obtain
something else</font>

549
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">that just might be
our future.</font>

550
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

551
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me
a "bitch" again.</font>

552
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

553
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me
a "bitch" again.</font>

554
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:08,925
