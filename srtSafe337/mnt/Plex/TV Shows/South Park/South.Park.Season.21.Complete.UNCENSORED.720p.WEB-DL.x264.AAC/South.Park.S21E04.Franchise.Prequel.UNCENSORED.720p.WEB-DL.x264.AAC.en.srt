32
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,408

36
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, superheroes,</font>

37
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's time to layout
our plan of action.</font>

38
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see, I have divided
the franchise plan</font>

39
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">into three phases.</font>

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phase one begins with
"The Coon" Netflix series</font>

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">and goes through
the "Coon and Friends United,"</font>

42
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">movie where we introduce
Tool Shed and the Human Kite.</font>

43
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">In phase two,
we do "Coon vs. Fastpass,"</font>

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">followed by an origin movie
about Mosquito.</font>

45
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bzzzzzt! Oh, boy!
I get my own origin movie?</font>

46
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bzzztzt!
That's right.</font>

47
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in Phase two
that we will finally introduce</font>

48
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tupperware,
our black superhero,</font>

49
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">like an ace in the hole.</font>

50
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa. Wait. How come we gotta
start off with a Netflix series?</font>

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we just go
right into movies?</font>

52
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Netflix is starving for
new shows right now, Toolshed.</font>

53
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will literally buy anything
people pitch them.</font>

54
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to strike
while the iron is hot.</font>

55
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later, in phase three, we can
finally get to Civil War,</font>

56
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">where we will all...</font>

57
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

58
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Incoming Facetime call

59
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,675

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You guys,
we have a big problem.</i></font>

61
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, SuperCraig?</font>

62
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,813
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Somebody is messing
with our Facebook page.</i></font>

63
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,415
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They're spreading
all these lies</i></font>

64
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,251
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and saying we like,
burn the American flag</i></font>

65
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,519
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and pee in each other's mouths.</i></font>

66
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spreading lies how?</font>

67
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Take a look.
Someone is systematically</i></font>

68
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,657
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>targeting
our Facebook followers</i></font>

69
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,526
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and feeding them
misinformation.</i></font>

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would deliberately
use Facebook</font>

71
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">in such
a horribly reckless way?</font>

72
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, you're not looking
at boobies again, are you?</font>

73
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dad,
I'm not looking at boobies.</font>

00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:47,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters.</font>

75
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, fellas!</font>

76
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters,
are you using Facebook</font>

77
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fuck with
our superhero franchise?</font>

78
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Umm...</font>

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

80
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters.
Butters!</font>

81
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, fellas?</font>

82
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, listen, we don't
have time for this.</font>

83
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now,
Netflix is buying</font>

84
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">any show
that people pitch them.</font>

85
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a real shot

86
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are a part
of that franchise plan, okay?</font>

87
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have movies planned
for the bad guy!</font>

88
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean
like "Suicide Squad"?</font>

89
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

90
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Suicide Squad"
sucked.</font>

91
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters!</font>

92
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters, you can't just
make stuff up about us.</font>

93
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are thinking
it's true.</font>

94
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, fellas, you have a right
to be on Facebook,</font>

95
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have a right
to be on Facebook.</font>

96
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">And sometimes, that's going
to cause a little...</font>

97
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">chaos.</font>

98
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta get to class.</font>

99
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude.
What a dick!</font>

100
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't find
a way to stop him,</font>

101
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're never going to make
any money, you guys.</font>

102
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming,
everyone.</font>

103
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you are all concerned
as Sarah and I are</font>

104
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what's happening
to our children.</font>

105
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't believe
that children in our town</font>

106
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">are dressing up
in hero costumes</font>

107
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">and peeing
in each other's mouths.</font>

108
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who are these kids?</font>

109
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone know?
They're wearing capes</font>

110
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forcing objects into
their own rectal cavities.</font>

111
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

112
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were shocked to read that
a young African-American boy</font>

113
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">is wearing Tupperware</font>

114
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">and defecating on girls
while they sleep.</font>

115
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if those kids are
hanging out with our kids?</font>

116
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I think
the problem is?</font>

117
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook.</font>

118
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook?
How so?</font>

119
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look,
we all know there's</font>

120
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">a lot of mixing
of truth and fiction</font>

121
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's been
on Facebook lately.</font>

122
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">And children lack
the cognitive ability</font>

123
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">to determine what's true
and what isn't on Facebook.</font>

124
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we now have
young kids</font>

125
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">dressing up in costumes,
eating poop,</font>

126
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">and having sex
with antelopes in our town.</font>

127
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we need to get our kids
off of Facebook.</font>

128
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll never happen.</font>

129
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I say we do?</font>

130
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg
to come and talk to us all</font>

131
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">about our concerns
in this community.</font>

132
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
he'd come?</font>

133
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not give it a try?</font>

134
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's invite
Mark Zuckerberg here</font>

135
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see
what he has to say.</font>

136
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure he's
a reasonable person.</font>

137
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?
What do you want?</font>

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here about the job?</font>

139
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, are you Adam?
Well, come on in!</font>

140
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making
a smart career choice, Adam.</font>

141
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, what we do here
is utilize Facebook</font>

142
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">not only to spread chaos
but to actually profit from it.</font>

143
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find the hours
very reasonable,</font>

144
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm working on getting</font>

145
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">full health and dental
for all employees.</font>

146
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's your
company uniform.</font>

147
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see,
what I've done, Adam,</font>

148
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">is built a completely
self-sustaining chaos machine...</font>

149
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look fantastic...</font>

150
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doing nothing more than what
Facebook was designed to do.</font>

151
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make money from Facebook
for my fake content</font>

152
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to pay Facebook
to promote my fake stories.</font>

153
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thusly,
we're growing bigger every day.</font>

154
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, can I have
your attention please?</font>

155
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have
a new agent of chaos.</font>

156
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please welcome
Adam Borque.</font>

157
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go. You can
take this workstation, Adam.</font>

158
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just start writing
horrible things about people</font>

159
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and presenting it as reality
on Facebook.</font>

160
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right! Don't forget
we have a chaos quota, gang!</font>

161
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's really
fuck shit up.</font>

162
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Can everyone
hear me in the back?</font>

163
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">M'kay We're gonna
get started here.</font>

164
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you all
have a lot of questions,</font>

165
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">so without further ado,</font>

166
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">let me introduce
Mark Zuckerberg.</font>

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for coming,
Mr. Zuckerberg.</font>

168
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
It is a great honor</font>

169
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be here
amongst all of you.</font>

170
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">For those few
who don't know,</font>

171
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">could you tell us
who you are?</font>

172
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the founder and chairman
of FACEBOOK:</font>

173
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I also have a style that is
completely unblockable.</font>

174
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
we'll let him speak,</font>

175
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we'll open the floor
to some questions</font>

176
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">if there's time.
Thank you.</font>

177
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, right.</font>

178
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Everyone here
wants to see my style.</font>

179
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first what I'll need
is a volunteer.</font>

180
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you sir?</font>

181
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook
has become a tool</font>

182
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">for some to disrupt our country
and our community...</font>

183
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say these things
like they are my fault,</font>

184
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet they are not.</font>

185
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you did
create a platform</font>

186
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a monetary incentive</font>

187
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">for people
to spread misinformation.</font>

188
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I see you're trying</font>

189
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">to use your style over mine.</font>

190
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you try
to block me.</font>

191
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brzzz! Byeow!</font>

192
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you have learned
that you cannot block me, yes?</font>

193
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
What is your question?</font>

194
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we supposed
to keep our kids...</font>

195
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ba-ba-ba-baaa!
Ztzztzzzt!</font>

196
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shwa! Ahh!
Pos-brb!</font>

197
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wilson Aubrey?</font>

198
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

199
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's us, your heroes,
Coon and Friends.</font>

200
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're, uh...
just wondering</font>

201
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you stopped following us
on Instagram.</font>

202
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you victimize
innocent people</font>

203
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">and poop in
little girls' mouths.</font>

204
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true,
Wilson.</font>

205
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're Coon and Friends,
not Harvey Weinstein.</font>

206
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook says it's true.</font>

207
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not true.</font>

208
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Facebook
says it's true.</font>

209
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but it's not true,</font>

210
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you need to have
your own fucking brain</font>

211
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">and decide shit
for yourself!</font>

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

213
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just face it.</font>

214
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're never gonna have
a superhero franchise!</font>

215
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so unfair!</font>

216
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, fellas.
We can't let Butters win.</font>

217
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it, Fastpass.
The world hates us now.</font>

218
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, nobody
believes in us.</font>

219
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe in each other,
don't we?</font>

220
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares what
everyone else thinks?</font>

221
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I joined this franchise
because I believe</font>

222
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it can make
a lot of money.</font>

223
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And being a superhero means
you keep believing in that money</font>

224
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter how hard
things get.</font>

225
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fastpass is right.</font>

226
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've let all this distract us
from what's important.</font>

227
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need to get
the Netflix series</font>

228
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let our superhero franchise
speak for itself.</font>

229
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coon, everybody hates us.</font>

230
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe so, but we
know who we are.</font>

231
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are Coon Friends because
we care about each other,</font>

232
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we have
each other's backs.</font>

233
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when things
look their darkest,</font>

234
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">these heroes
will stand together and re...</font>

235
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, babe,
what's up?</font>

236
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you up to?</font>

237
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. Just fucking
wearing sweet costumes,</font>

238
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about fighting evil.</font>

239
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that okay?</font>

240
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just... I thought we were
meeting at the park.</font>

241
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't
text or anything.</font>

242
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Are you fucking
kidding me right now?</font>

243
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry!
I won't interrupt.</font>

244
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we are
Coon and Friends,</font>

245
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">and as long as
we have each other,</font>

246
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can do anything!</font>

247
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear that was the worst
public speaker I've ever seen.</font>

248
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was
Mark Zuckerberg's point?</font>

249
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even understand
what that was about.</font>

250
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess nobody realized</font>

251
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark Zuckerberg
was such a penis.</font>

252
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:38,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

253
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Mark Zuckerberg.</font>

254
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who it is!</font>

255
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me,
what are you doing here?</font>

256
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was invited here
by people.</font>

257
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">We invited you
to come speak</font>

258
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">to our community
about our problems!</font>

259
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! I see what you did there.
Trying to block me, right?</font>

260
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am tired of eating chips.
What else is there?</font>

261
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

262
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of our fridge.</font>

263
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">This puny
refrigerator could not block me.</font>

264
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
you can?</font>

265
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you listen here!
I will not...</font>

266
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bzzt!</font>

267
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Jrmm!
Pyow! Wha!</font>

268
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no match
for my style.</font>

269
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, where are we headed?
Perhaps we should get some food.</font>

270
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... Excuse me,
this is<i> our</i> car.</font>

271
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You call this a car?</font>

272
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't even remotely able
to block me.</font>

273
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this car's style?</font>

274
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get... Get out of here,
you... you penis!</font>

275
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say I am a penis,</font>

276
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet I am not a penis.</font>

277
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Netflix. You're green lit.
Who am I speaking with?</font>

278
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yes, hello, we have
an idea for a show</font>

279
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we think would be great
for Netflix.</font>

280
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great.
Would you like a pilot</font>

281
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">or just go straight to
an order of six episodes?</font>

282
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to go
right into six episodes</font>

283
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a pickup option
at the end of three.</font>

284
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it. Can you start shooting
next month?</font>

285
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a show about
transsexual dragons here!</font>

286
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we're ready to start
right now.</font>

287
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are very, very excited.</font>

288
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, sounds great.
We'll send you the contracts.</font>

289
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, uh,
what's the show about?</font>

290
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a stand-alone series</font>

291
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">about a superhero
called The Coon</font>

292
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he joins
Coon and Friends.</font>

293
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coon and Friends?</font>

294
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean the kids
I just read about in the news</font>

295
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">who stabbed Jessica Alba?</font>

296
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you didn't... you didn't
read that on the news.</font>

297
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">You read that on Facebook.</font>

298
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, man, here we go.</font>

299
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah uh, digit,
we've never done this before,</font>

300
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to pass on your show.</font>

301
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me!</font>

302
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are falsehoods about us
on Facebook that are not true!</font>

303
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then you should
have those things taken down.</font>

304
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't be that hard.</font>

305
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot harder
than you think!</font>

306
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we'd love
to approve your show,</font>

307
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you need to get those things
cleared up first, okay?</font>

308
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for calling.</font>

309
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Netflix. You're green lit.
Who am I speaking with?</font>

310
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...
Who are you?</font>

311
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe
that's Mark Zuckerberg.</font>

312
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's my soup!</font>

313
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you are trying
to block me, huh?</font>

314
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fine.
What's your style?</font>

315
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a style!</font>

316
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Get out of my bed!</font>

317
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was invited here.</font>

318
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am only making use of a bed
for sleeping, yes?</font>

319
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just wanted you
to come</font>

320
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">share your insights
on Facebook!</font>

00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my head! My head!
Shaaa!</font>

323
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have worked with me
when you had the chance.</font>

324
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you lie
over there, dead.</font>

325
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention,
employees.</font>

326
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kelly Shmidt has just written
her 100th fake blog post</font>

00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was shared over 1,000 times
on Facebook.</font>

328
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's hear it for Kelly!</font>

329
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget about
those Chaos incentives!</font>

330
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,522

Stick to your work.</font>

336
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will deal
with these trespassers.</font>

337
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here
to put an end to you, Chaos!</font>

338
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! I don't have
butt sex with antelopes,</font>

gentlemen.</font>

341
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,544

about what I'm doing.</font>

342
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Nothing illegal about us
kicking your a-a-ass either.</font>

343
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually that<i> is</i> illegal.</font>

344
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">And besides, you can't do
anything to me.</font>

345
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hyah! Syo-yo-yo!</font>

346

is that?</font>

350
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
that's Mark Zuckerberg.</font>

351
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna get
to Butters, right?</font>

352
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have
to get through me, huh!</font>

353
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude. This kid
is deliberately lying about us</font>

354
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">on your platform
for no other reason</font>

355
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">than to cause harm.</font>

356
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you
protecting him?</font>

357
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:48,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple.
He paid me $17.23.</font>

358
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Facebook
safeguard program.</font>

359
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just $17 monthly
gets you</font>

360
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">personal protection
from Mark Zuckerberg.</font>

361
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!
What's your style?</font>

362
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right.
Everyone calm down.</font>

363
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't hear over all you!</font>

364
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have
to do something!</font>

365
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy is going around</font>

366
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">acting like everyone's stuff
is his!</font>

367
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of getting
out of the shower</font>

368
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find Mark Zuckerberg
sitting on my toilet!</font>

369
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zuckerberg ate everything
in our freezer</font>

370
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then helped himself
to my wife's lubricant!</font>

371
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right.
Everyone!</font>

372
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want
to know one thing.</font>

373
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:33,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who invited him here?</font>

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Who invited
Mark Zuckerberg to town</font>

375
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the first place?</font>

376
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We did.
- We did.</font>

377
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? What's that?</font>

378
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">We invited Mark Zuckerberg
to town.</font>

379
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.
That's what I thought.</font>

380
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all brought Mark Zuckerberg
into your lives</font>

381
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now you want the police
to shoot him.</font>

382
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please,
you don't understand.</font>

383
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's...
He's such a penis.</font>

384
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his
voice is dubbed</font>

385
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he does all
his own sound effects...</font>

386
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that doesn't mean
he's done anything illegal.</font>

387
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the police will help deal
with Mark Zuckerberg, but...</font>

388
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">we aren't going to shoot him.</font>

389
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
that's just the way it is.</font>

390
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all should have thought
harder about this</font>

391
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">before letting him
into your lives.</font>

392
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we all became superheroes,
we took an oath.</font>

393
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">That no matter what it took we
would make shit loads of money.</font>

394
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg,
right now...</font>

395
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are a superhero group</font>

396
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">that can't even get a show
on Netflix.</font>

397
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zuckerberg is the key.</font>

398
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the only person
who can shut down Facebook.</font>

399
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we going to get him
to do that?</font>

400
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna beat him
at his own game.</font>

401
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got the west entrance
to town secure.</font>

402
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you guys doing
out east?</font>

403
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he comes.</font>

404
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:02,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg.
That's gonna have to be it.</font>

405
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't let you into town.</font>

406
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you think
you can block me?</font>

407
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, people
don't want you here okay?</font>

408
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a quiet little town
and...</font>

409
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot block me.</font>

410
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's plenty of other places
you can go, sir.</font>

411
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you please just...</font>

412
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't...
Don't do that please...</font>

413
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brain! My brain!
Aah!</font>

414
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">He walked through.</font>

415
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah! My my car! My car!</font>

416
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!
It's Mark Zuckerberg!</font>

417
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!
How'd he do that?</font>

418
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter?
Too f-f-fast for you?</font>

419
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw me walk right
through that police barricade,</font>

420
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet you think
you can block me, right?</font>

421
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and try.</font>

422
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Zuckerberg! Let's see you
block my shtoile!</font>

423
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pew! Pew! Pew!</font>

424
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha, da, da, da, da.
Bam!</font>

425
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:09,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

426
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

427
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have never witnessed
this style before!</font>

428
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look!
The freaky costume kids</font>

429
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">are getting Zuckerberg!</font>

430
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him, kids!</font>

431
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poop in his mouth!</font>

432
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

433
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tried to match my style
and failed!</font>

434
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It is over!</font>

435
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends are all beaten!
Why?</font>

436
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were just children.</font>

437
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one simply protesting
for black lives.</font>

438
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this child trying to speak
out for handicapped people!</font>

439
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">W-Why, Mark Zuckerberg?</font>

440
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my friend Kyle,</font>

441
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">guilty of nothing but standing
up for the rights of Jews.</font>

442
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wh-wha-what
are you talking about?</font>

443
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever heard

<font color="#FFFFFF">Butters! You're the one
who started all this?</font>

464

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

465
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think
you're just so smart don't you?</font>

00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir! No, sir, I just... Make
me look like a fool will you?</font>

467
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,253

471
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,397

used Facebook like Russia did</font>

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">and really didn't break
any rules...</font>

473
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't break any rules!</font>

474
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job teaching our children
that's all that matters!</font>

475
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because there's a way to
cause chaos in a town</font>

476
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">or disrupt an entire country</font>

477
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't mean you go and do it,
does it?</font>

478

<font color="#FFFFFF">If Mark Zuckerberg
points a loaded cannon</font>

480
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you innocent
for just lighting the fuse?</font>

481
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me.</font>

482
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! You don't go around making
up things about people either,</font>

483
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless it's about
Mark Zuckerberg</font>

484
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause he deserves it.</font>

485
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're both
very satisfied</font>

486
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the damage you've caused,
because you're both grounded!</font>

487
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coon Friends, we have done it.</font>

488
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facebook is gone and Netflix
has approved our TV show.</font>

489
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we have to do now</font>

490
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">is agree on the final draft
of the franchise plan.</font>

491
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can see that the
SuperCraig movie now precedes</font>

492
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Coon VS SuperCraig movie</font>

493
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">followed by Mysterion's
video game and then...</font>

494
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">How come I have to have
the video game?</font>

495
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna movie too.</font>

496
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a movie, Mysterion.</font>

497
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the third
Coon and Friends United movie</font>

498
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">after your video game.</font>

499
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't
ever get his own movie.</font>

500
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I get my own movie? Not
everyone gets their own movie.</font>

501
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This franchise plan sucks.
- Oh, Jesus, here we go again.</font>

502
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">No,
Wonder Tweek is right.</font>

503
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was better when we started
the movies off</font>

504
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the Tupperware prequel. Dude,
you can't do a prequel first.</font>

505
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- 'Cause then it's not a prequel,</font>

506
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's just first.</font>

507
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">And besides Tupperware
isn't our strongest character.</font>

508
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.
It's better than a human kite.</font>

509
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just likes this plan because
he gets two movies in phase one.</font>

510
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys! We have to just
go with this plan.</font>

511
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even have
one movie yet!</font>

512
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,782
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You</i> go with the plan.</font>

513
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we'll just go
and do our own franchise.</font>

514
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yeah!</font>

515
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you want civil war?
Is that what you want?</font>

516
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, dude. It's civil war.
Fuck you.</font>

517
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck you.
Get outta my house.</font>

518
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll make way more money
on our franchise!</font>

519
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead. I bet you don't even
get halfway through phase one</font>

520
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">on your franchise,
DC Comics.</font>

521
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought Civil War wasn't
supposed to happen</font>

522
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">until phase three.
- Shut up, SuperCraig.</font>

523
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wilson Aubrey?
Yeah.</font>

524
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's us, your heroes,
Coon and Friends.</font>

525
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're, uh...
just wondering</font>

526
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you stopped following us
on Instagram.</font>

527
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:05,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you victimize
innocent people</font>

528
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">and poop in
little girls' mouths.</font>

529
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true,
Wilson.</font>

530
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're Coon and Friends,
not Harvey Weinstein.</font>
