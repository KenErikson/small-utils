1
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start simple.</font>

2
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start with what you know is true.</font>

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.</font>

4
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped.</font>

5
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta... Peeta was left behind.</font>

6
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen?</font>

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be in here.</font>

8
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a nightmare. Just five more minutes.</font>

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to sleep. We can help you sleep.</font>

10
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just five more minutes.</font>

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please, don't. It's just five more...</font>

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't touch me! Don't! No!
No! Get off of me!</font>

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick.</font>

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to go back for Peeta and Johanna,</font>

16
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I, uh...</font>

17
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't move.</font>

18
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have Annie, too. They took her.</font>

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's, uh...</font>

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's in the Capitol.</font>

21
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish she was dead.</font>

22
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish they were all dead and we were, too.</font>

23
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen.</font>

24
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colonel Boggs, District 13's head of security.</font>

25
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've been discharged,</font>

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">but President Coin's requested
to meet with you first.</font>

27
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any news?</font>

28
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just here to escort you.</font>

29
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were always told there was nothing left of 13.</font>

30
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.</font>

31
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're military, so we learned
to survive down here.</font>

32
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Preparing, training.</font>

33
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The war never stopped for us.</font>

34
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is.</font>

35
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our Girl on Fire.</font>

36
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam President, may I present you
with the Mockingjay.</font>

37
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">What an honor it is to meet you.</font>

38
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a courageous young woman.</font>

39
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how disorienting this must be.</font>

40
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't imagine what it's like to live
through the atrocities of those Games.</font>

41
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss,</font>

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Alma Coin.</font>

43
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please know how welcome you are.</font>

44
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you'll find some comfort with us.</font>

45
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've known loss in 13, too.</font>

46
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is history. Right here at this table.</font>

47
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize.</font>

48
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish you had more time to recover, but
unfortunately, we don't have that luxury.</font>

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, have a seat.</font>

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you aware of what's happened?</font>

51
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you fired your arrow at the force field,</font>

52
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">you electrified the nation.</font>

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.</font>

54
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe that if we keep this energy going,
we can unify the districts against the Capitol.</font>

55
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,</font>

56
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">we could be waiting another 75 years
for this opportunity.</font>

57
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone in 13 is ready for this.</font>

58
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Peeta? Is he alive?</font>

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. And I wish that I did.</font>

60
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.</font>

61
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Capitol has always suppressed communication
between the districts.</font>

62
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know their system very well.</font>

63
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I managed to break through.</font>

64
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we need now is the perfect message.</font>

65
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, here's what we need to do.</font>

66
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to show them that the Mockingjay's
alive and well</font>

67
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">and willing to stand up
and join this fight.</font>

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.</font>

69
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way you did.</font>

70
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're gonna shoot a series
of propaganda clips,</font>

71
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">propos, I like to call them,</font>

72
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the Mockingjay.</font>

73
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spreads the word</font>

74
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we're gonna stoke the fire
of this rebellion.</font>

75
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fire that the Mockingjay started.</font>

76
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left him there.</font>

77
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You left Peeta in that arena to die.
- Katniss, there are so many...</font>

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta was the one who was supposed to live.</font>

79
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen.</font>

80
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">This revolution is about everyone.</font>

81
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about all of us.</font>

82
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we need a voice.</font>

83
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you should've saved Peeta.</font>

84
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should have rescued the boy instead.</font>

85
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

86
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, listen to me. No one else can do this but her.</font>

87
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the girl you described.</font>

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, we need to make it personal.</font>

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remind her who the real enemy is.</font>

90
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.</font>

91
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless she's forgotten.</font>

92
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's explaining and there's showing.</font>

93
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her see what the Capitol did to 12.</font>

94
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't handle it. The Games destroyed her.</font>

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only choice you have.</font>

96
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't always show up the way
you want them to, Madam President.</font>

97
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that anger, that anger-driven defiance,
that's what we want. And we can redirect it.</font>

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to unite these people out there</font>

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">that have been doing nothing
but killing each other</font>

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">in an arena for years.</font>

101
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to have a lightning rod.</font>

102
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll follow her. She's the face
of the revolution.</font>

103
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her see it. Let her go home.</font>

104
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send her.</font>

105
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you're going through with this.</font>

106
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can say "no".</font>

107
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to see it for myself.</font>

108
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

109
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">13 swept everything, top to bottom</font>

110
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you'd be safe.</font>

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you don't want me to go with you?</font>

112
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm sure.</font>

113
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have our eyes on you from above.</font>

114
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figures.</font>

115
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

116
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

117
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you wanna see Prim?</font>

118
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go. You're breakin' my heart.</font>

119
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shhh.</font>

120
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Egeria!</font>

121
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to fix these lines.</font>

122
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't say "rebels".</font>

123
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are senseless acts of defiance.</font>

124
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I won't legitimize them.</font>

125
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll call them "criminals".</font>

126
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

127
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Radicals".</font>

128
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

129
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.</font>

130
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never let them see you bleed.</font>

131
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Citizens,</font>

132
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">tonight I address all of Panem as one.</font>

133
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the Dark Days,</font>

134
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Panem has had an unprecedented era of peace.</font>

135
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a peace built upon cooperation.</font>

136
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a respect for law and order.</font>

137
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the past weeks, you have heard
of sporadic violence</font>

138
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">following the actions of a few radicals
in the Quarter Quell.</font>

139
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those who choose this destructive path,</font>

140
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">your actions are based
on a misunderstanding</font>

141
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">of how we have survived. Together.</font>

142
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a contract.</font>

143
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.</font>

144
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">In return, the Capitol provides
order and security.</font>

145
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">To refuse work</font>

146
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to put the entire system in danger.</font>

147
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Capitol is the beating heart of Panem.</font>

148
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing can survive without a heart.</font>

149
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">The criminals that kneel before you use symbols
for the purpose of sedition.</font>

150
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why all images of the Mockingjay
are now forbidden.</font>

151
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Possessing them will be considered treason.</font>

152
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Punishable by death.</font>

153
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Justice shall be served swiftly.</font>

154
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Order shall be restored.</font>

155
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">To those who ignore the warnings
of history...</font>

156
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">prepare to pay the ultimate price.</font>

157
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

158
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're okay.</font>

159
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all here now.</font>

160
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buttercup!</font>

161
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smuggled him in.</font>

162
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got Dad.</font>

163
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got some of your herbs
from the kitchen.</font>

164
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have strict rules.</font>

165
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what they'll do
if they find him here.</font>

166
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try to eat something.</font>

167
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Good evening.</font>

168
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a big welcome to all in Panem.</font>

169
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Caesar Flickerman.</font>

170
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whoever you are, whatever
it is you're doing,</font>

171
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're working, put down your work.</font>

172
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're having dinner,
stop having dinner.</font>

173
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you are going to want
to witness this tonight.</font>

174
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has been rampant speculation</font>

175
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">about what really happened
in the Quarter Quell.</font>

176
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here to shed a little light on the subject for us
is a very special guest.</font>

177
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.</font>

178
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, a lot of people feel as though
they are in the dark.</font>

179
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know how they feel.</font>

180
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, so set the stage for us.</font>

181
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk us through what really happened
on that final and controversial night.</font>

182
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, first off, you have to understand
that when you're in the Games</font>

183
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">you only get one wish. It's very costly.</font>

184
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're alive.</font>

185
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">It costs your life.</font>

186
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it costs more than your life.</font>

187
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you mean? What's more than your life?</font>

188
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean to murder innocent people,
that costs everything that you are.</font>

189
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

190
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you hold on to that one wish.</font>

191
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that night my wish
was to save Katniss.</font>

192
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

193
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've just run off with her earlier
in the day like she'd wanted.</font>

194
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you didn't.</font>

195
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?</font>

196
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was caught up trying to play allies.</font>

197
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then they separated us</font>

198
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's when I lost her.</font>

199
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then the lightning hit</font>

200
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the whole force field around the arena
just blew out.</font>

201
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but, Peeta,</font>

202
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss is the one who blew it out.</font>

203
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

204
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw the footage.</font>

205
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she didn't know what she was doing.</font>

206
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither of us knew</font>

207
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a bigger plan going on.
We had no idea.</font>

208
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You had no "idea"?
- No.</font>

209
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. Well, Peeta, there are many who
find this suspicious, to say the least.</font>

210
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:35,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

211
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems as though she was part
of a rebel plan.</font>

212
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it was part of her plan
to be almost killed by Johanna?</font>

213
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or part of the plan to be paralyzed
by lightning?</font>

214
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we were not part of any rebel plan.
We had no idea what was going on.</font>

215
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. I believe you, Peeta Mellark.
Thank you.</font>

216
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

217
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was going to ask you
to speak about the unrest</font>

218
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think you might be too upset.</font>

219
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can.</font>

220
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.</font>

221
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

222
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everyone who's watching to stop</font>

223
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to think about what
a civil war could mean.</font>

224
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We almost went extinct once before.</font>

225
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now our numbers are even fewer.</font>

226
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's one of them.</font>

227
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this really what we wanna do?</font>

228
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a traitor.</font>

229
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill ourselves off?</font>

230
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing is not the answer.</font>

231
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe he's doing this.</font>

232
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone needs to lay down
their weapons immediately.</font>

233
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitor!</font>

234
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not one of us!</font>

235
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is treason!</font>

236
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you calling for a ceasefire?</font>

237
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I am.</font>

238
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a puppet!</font>

239
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang him!</font>

240
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everyone to stop
the senseless violence.</font>

241
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the path to change.</font>

242
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitor!</font>

243
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the path to justice.</font>

244
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">There can't be a ceasefire.</font>

245
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not after everything Snow's done.</font>

246
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could have done a lot of damage tonight.</font>

247
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most districts, people are still
too afraid to join.</font>

248
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need the courage.</font>

249
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think he said that?</font>

250
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Maybe he was forced.</font>

251
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't look that bad.</font>

252
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he made some kind of deal
to protect you.</font>

253
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still playing the game.</font>

254
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

255
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare.</font>

256
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay. I get 'em, too.</font>

257
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta,</font>

258
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you stay with me?</font>

259
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

260
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

261
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

262
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't sleep?</font>

263
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what's happening.</font>

264
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good at keeping secrets.</font>

265
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even from Mom.</font>

266
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one hates the Capitol more than me.</font>

267
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I wanna help. But I just keep thinking.</font>

268
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeta?</font>

269
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he's not safe there, but
he's definitely not safe here.</font>

270
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you know how important
you are to them.</font>

271
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want something,
you just have to ask.</font>

272
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could demand almost anything.</font>

273
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd have to agree to it.</font>

274
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should wake you up more often, Little Duck.</font>

275
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some sleep now.</font>

276
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too.</font>

277
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.</font>

278
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay.</font>

279
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have some conditions.</font>

280
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta and the other Tributes, Johanna Mason
and Annie Cresta,</font>

281
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be rescued at the earliest opportunity.</font>

282
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">If and when Peeta is liberated,</font>

283
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will receive a full and unconditional pardon.</font>

284
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">No punishment will be inflicted.</font>

285
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the same goes for the other Tributes.</font>

286
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

287
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not their fault you abandoned them
in the arena.</font>

288
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're doing and saying whatever
they can to survive.</font>

289
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Individuals don't make demands in 13.</font>

290
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be a tribunal.
And a fair judgment.</font>

291
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

292
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Victors will be granted immunity.</font>

293
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will announce that in front
of the entire population of 13.</font>

294
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will hold yourself and your
government responsible,</font>

295
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you will find another Mockingjay.</font>

296
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. That's her. Right there.</font>

297
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that who I promised you?</font>

298
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wears the costume.</font>

299
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gunfire in the background.
A hint of smoke.</font>

300
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our Mockingjay.</font>

301
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.</font>

302
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is worth the risk.</font>

303
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's worth the risk.</font>

304
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people.</font>

305
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,</font>

306
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">in wartime I think even the noblest of causes
can be bent a little bit. Right?</font>

307
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any other conditions?</font>

308
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sister gets to keep her cat.</font>

309
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away.</font>

310
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it visiting hours again?</font>

311
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Trinket,</font>

312
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">you see this door.</font>

313
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">It opens. From the inside.</font>

314
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.</font>

315
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a prisoner. You're
free to join the rest of 13.</font>

316
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not looking like this. Thank you very much.</font>

317
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:48,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a bigger issue than wardrobe,
Miss Trinket.</font>

318
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss has agreed to be the Mockingjay.</font>

319
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">That poor thing.</font>

320
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.</font>

321
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to join this team now.</font>

322
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need someone she trusts.</font>

323
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Haymitch?</font>

324
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's drying out in some facility a mile down.</font>

325
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aiding rebels is not really my forte.</font>

326
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Trinket, your days
in the Capitol are over,</font>

327
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter what happens here.</font>

328
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna play a prisoner of war, fine.</font>

329
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here and rot.</font>

330
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find someone else to be
the Mockingjay's escort.</font>

331
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

332
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone can be replaced.</font>

333
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not your Mockingjay.</font>

334
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">There isn't a soul in this dungeon who
knows the first thing about Katniss.</font>

335
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You honestly believe one
of these cave dwellers</font>

336
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">is going to take my place?</font>

337
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

338
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good afternoon.</font>

339
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for interrupting your schedules.</font>

340
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have already been adjusted
to compensate for the delay.</font>

341
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hardly ever see children around here.</font>

342
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, check in with your unit supervisors
when you resume work.</font>

343
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of them were lost in an epidemic
a few years ago.</font>

344
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an announcement
for the citizens of 13.</font>

345
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coin lost her family, too.</font>

346
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daughter and a husband.</font>

347
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">And our welcome guests from 12.</font>

348
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen has consented
to be the face of our cause</font>

349
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.</font>

350
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">In exchange, I have promised
several concessions.</font>

351
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors</font>

352
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">held hostage in the Capitol.</font>

353
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta Mellark...</font>

354
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna Mason...</font>

355
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.</font>

356
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Annie Cresta.</font>

357
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once freed,</font>

358
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes</font>

359
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">committed against the rebel cause.</font>

360
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

361
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good, Katniss.</font>

362
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Katniss Everdeen fails to fulfill
her duties, the deal will be off.</font>

363
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your attention.</font>

364
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, resume your daily schedules.</font>

365
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam President.</font>

366
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Effie Trinket.</font>

367
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to 13.</font>

368
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Madam President, may I say you are so very concise.
- Hmm.</font>

369
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You believe that there's more to be said?</font>

370
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I speak freely?</font>

371
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't appear to do anything else.</font>

372
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only talking about salesmanship.</font>

373
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.</font>

374
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling</font>

375
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">and warmth.</font>

376
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit of oxygen.</font>

377
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oxygen.</font>

378
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">One sure way to put it out
is to smother it.</font>

379
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or to use up all the air in the room.</font>

380
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

381
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what could use a revolution?
That hair.</font>

382
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Effie?</font>

383
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

384
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

385
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a political refugee.</font>

386
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch rescued you?</font>

387
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.</font>

388
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I were both in the dark.</font>

389
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm condemned to this life of jumpsuits.</font>

390
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is wonderful to see you again.</font>

391
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe this place?</font>

392
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss coffee.</font>

393
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew anyplace could be so strict.</font>

394
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:58,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I thought at least in the higher ranks
there'd be some side action.</font>

395
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss my wigs.</font>

396
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily, I remembered that this was all
the rage when I was coming up.</font>

397
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:08,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, everything old
can be made new again.</font>

398
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like democracy.</font>

399
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which brings me to this.</font>

400
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna.</font>

401
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead, isn't he?</font>

402
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, dear.</font>

403
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this</font>

404
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you'd decided to be the Mockingjay
on your own.</font>

405
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew the risks. As we all do.</font>

406
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believed in this revolution.</font>

407
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believed in you.</font>

408
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're beautiful.</font>

409
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have it.</font>

410
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have the Mockingjay outfit.</font>

411
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not much of a prep team here in 13,</font>

412
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we will make you</font>

413
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">the best-dressed rebel in history.</font>

414
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

415
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring up the lights.</font>

416
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna's final touch.</font>

417
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's either gonna
wanna kiss you, kill you,</font>

418
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">or be you.</font>

419
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

420
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely perfect.</font>

421
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Let's bring up the setting.</font>

422
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

423
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little Wind.</font>

424
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Katniss, we're gonna start
you down on one knee.</font>

425
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- And as you rise up,</font>

426
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna hold your flag in the air
and deliver your line.</font>

427
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">And remember you've just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol</font>

428
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">arm-in-arm with your brothers and sisters.</font>

429
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

430
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you're ready.</font>

431
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Panem, we fight, we dare, we...</font>

432
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know the line?</font>

433
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.
- Okay, alright.</font>

434
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do it again.
- She's warming up.</font>

435
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. With energy. Go.</font>

436
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Panem, we fight!</font>

437
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">We dare to end this hunger for justice!</font>

438
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've just been in battle!</font>

439
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Excuse my outburst.</font>

440
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've just been in battle.</font>

441
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try it again.</font>

442
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you're ready.</font>

443
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Panem, we fight!</font>

444
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">We dare to end this hunger for justice.</font>

445
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that, my friends, is how a revolution dies.</font>

446
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Katniss.</font>

447
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">This how you greet an old friend?</font>

448
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I don't recognize you sober.</font>

449
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it looks as bad as it feels.</font>

450
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Panem, we fight!</font>

451
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We dare! We end this hunger for justice!</font>

452
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Madam President,</font>

453
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">indulge me for a moment, if you would.</font>

454
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's everybody think of one incident</font>

455
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:14,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Katniss Everdeen
genuinely moved you.</font>

456
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not where you were jealous
of her hairstyle</font>

457
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">or her dress went up in flames</font>

458
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">or she made a halfway decent shot
with an arrow.</font>

459
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not where Peeta made you like her.</font>

460
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'd like you all to think of one moment
where she made you feel something real.</font>

461
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

462
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she volunteered for her sister
at the Reaping.</font>

463
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent example.</font>

464
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

465
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope that wasn't important.</font>

466
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... okay. "Volunteer for sister".</font>

467
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. What else?</font>

468
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. When she sang that song for little Rue.</font>

469
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Who didn't get choked up at that?</font>

470
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.</font>

471
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I like you better sober.</font>

472
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she chose Rue as an Ally, as well.</font>

473
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, yes.</font>

474
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what do all these have in common?</font>

475
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one told her what to do.</font>

476
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unscripted, yes.</font>

477
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So maybe we should just leave her alone.</font>

478
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wash her face.</font>

479
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's still a girl. You made her look 35.</font>

480
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">The opportunities for spontaneity
are obviously</font>

481
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">lacking below ground.</font>

482
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what you're suggesting
is we toss her into combat?</font>

483
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sanction putting
an untrained civilian</font>

484
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">in battle just for effect.</font>

485
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the Capitol.</font>

486
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.</font>

487
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we can't protect her.</font>

488
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has to come from her.</font>

489
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what people respond to.</font>

490
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want a symbol for the revolution?</font>

491
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.</font>

492
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe there's someplace
that's less dangerous.</font>

493
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">District 8. They reported heavy bombing
last week.</font>

494
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no military targets left.</font>

495
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't guarantee her safety.</font>

496
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never be able to guarantee my safety.</font>

497
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna go.</font>

498
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you're killed?</font>

499
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure you get it on camera.</font>

500
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made you some surprises.</font>

501
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you wanna try one out.</font>

502
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're gonna be a part
of Katniss' propo team,</font>

503
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may as well look the part.</font>

504
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this one is for you.</font>

505
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon</font>

506
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the sake of the propos</font>

507
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I couldn't just make you
a fashion accessory.</font>

508
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

509
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look here.</font>

510
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows.</font>

511
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">All color-coded.</font>

512
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tell Finnick</font>

513
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a trident for him</font>

514
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he's ready.</font>

515
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might just cheer him... cheer him up.</font>

516
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

517
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not fire the red ones in here.</font>

518
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had all of this and you just left
the districts to fend for themselves?</font>

519
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.</font>

520
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.</font>

521
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we could've bombed the Capitol</font>

522
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:03,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they would've retaliated with
at least twice the firepower.</font>

523
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what?</font>

524
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">There would've been nobody left
to claim victory.</font>

525
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like exactly what Peeta said
and then you all called him a traitor.</font>

526
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, soldier.</font>

527
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are camera-ready.</font>

528
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't your comrade look handsome?</font>

529
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

530
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back safe.</font>

531
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick introductions, Katniss.</font>

532
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people have come a long way
to support the cause.</font>

533
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Cressida.</font>

534
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my opinion one of the best up-and-coming
directors in the Capitol.</font>

535
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until I up-and-left. Hey.</font>

536
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

537
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see what you can do.</font>

538
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. Be careful.</font>

539
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:54,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my assistant, Messalla.</font>

540
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an honor to meet you.</font>

541
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your cameramen over there, Castor.</font>

542
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

543
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Pollux.</font>

544
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get locked in.</font>

545
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all from the Capitol?</font>

546
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch got you out?</font>

547
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't expect much chitchat from him.</font>

548
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an Avox. Capitol cut
his tongue out years ago.</font>

549
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, no, it wasn't any sort of rescue,
if that's what you mean.</font>

550
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all fled on our own.</font>

551
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">For this.</font>

552
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you.</font>

553
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has gotta be fast. In and out.</font>

554
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move out.</font>

555
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're alive then. We weren't sure.</font>

556
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.</font>

557
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss has been recovering, but
she insisted on coming out</font>

558
00:43:42,516 --> 00:43:43,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seein' some of your wounded.</font>

559
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've got plenty of those.</font>

560
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a mass grave a few blocks west, but,
I can't spare the manpower to move them yet.</font>

561
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hospital's past that curtain.</font>

562
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any hope you can give them, it's worth it.</font>

563
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Capitol's done everything
they can to break us.</font>

564
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you worried about having all
your wounded in one place?</font>

565
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's better than
leaving them to die.</font>

566
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what I meant.</font>

567
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's my only other option.</font>

568
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can come up with another,
I'm all ears.</font>

569
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's right through here.</font>

570
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't film me in there. I can't help them.</font>

571
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let them see your face.</font>

572
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

573
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

574
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You alright?</font>

575
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Here, it's okay.</font>

576
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got you. It's alright.</font>

577
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen?</font>

578
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

579
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to see you.</font>

580
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:57,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the baby?</font>

581
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost it.</font>

582
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you fighting, Katniss?</font>

583
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You here to fight with us?</font>

584
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

585
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:15,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

586
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tighter.</font>

587
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:39,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tighter, tighter.</font>

588
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, some cameras were damaged
in the bombings,</font>

589
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we confirmed it's her.</font>

590
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoom in.</font>

591
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was visiting a makeshift hospital.</font>

592
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not sure if she's still there.</font>

593
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

594
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.</font>

595
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">We may be able to target her.</font>

596
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

597
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:23,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill the wounded.</font>

598
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:24,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir...</font>

599
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.</font>

600
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any association with the Mockingjay symbol
is forbidden.</font>

601
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.</font>

602
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show them what it costs to be friends
with Katniss Everdeen.</font>

603
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.</font>

604
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will this play in the districts?</font>

605
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be tattooed on their eyes.</font>

606
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a problem.</font>

607
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kinda problem?</font>

608
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:59,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Incoming bombers from the north.</font>

609
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find cover now.</font>

610
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a bunker in there.</font>

611
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Straight ahead and down the stairs.</font>

612
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss!</font>

613
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss!</font>

614
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everdeen! Everdeen!</font>

615
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale, back away from the wall!</font>

616
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

617
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

618
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going after something to the south.</font>

619
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's towards the hospital.</font>

620
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're circling back around. Come on!</font>

621
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the hospital.</font>

622
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:55,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're targeting the hospital.</font>

623
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help them!</font>

624
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help them! Get them out!</font>

625
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:56,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

626
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you're seeing right now?</font>

627
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, what do you wanna say?</font>

628
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the rebels to know that I'm alive.</font>

629
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:22,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I'm in District 8</font>

630
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the Capitol just bombed a hospital</font>

631
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">filled with unarmed men,
women and children.</font>

632
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there will be no survivors.</font>

633
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think for one second that the Capitol
will ever treat us fairly,</font>

634
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are lying to yourselves.</font>

635
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we know who they are
and what they do.</font>

636
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what they do! And we must fight back.</font>

637
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a message for President Snow.</font>

638
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can torture us and bomb us and burn
our districts to the ground.</font>

639
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">But do you see that?</font>

640
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire is catching.</font>

641
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we burn, you burn with us!</font>

642
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know who they are and what they do.</font>

643
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what they do!</font>

644
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we must fight back.</font>

645
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can torture us and bomb us</font>

646
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">and burn our districts to the ground.</font>

647
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch's faith in you wasn't misplaced.</font>

648
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:53,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">But do you see that?</font>

649
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

650
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:55,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire is catching.</font>

651
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come up with me for the beginning.</font>

652
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we burn, you burn with us!</font>

653
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no progress without compromise.</font>

654
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">No victory without sacrifice.</font>

655
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:40,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I stand here with the Mockingjay</font>

656
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:44,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">to announce that our moment has arrived.</font>

657
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beetee has increased our use
of the airwaves tenfold.</font>

658
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will broadcast this message</font>

659
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">to all the districts tonight.</font>

660
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Mockingjay's words</font>

661
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">inspiring everyone to join the rebellion.</font>

662
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:31,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together, we will become an alliance
to be reckoned with.</font>

663
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!</font>

664
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like hearing a fight song
at a funeral, huh?</font>

665
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more people on our side, the closer
we are to Peeta and Annie.</font>

666
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

667
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">By order of President Snow</font>

668
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">daily production quotas
have been increased.</font>

669
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:22,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.</font>

670
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.</font>

671
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:32,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">By order of President Snow daily production quotas
have been increased.</font>

672
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we burn, you burn with us!</font>

673
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

674
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:27,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

675
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

676
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:52,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I got good news.
- What?</font>

677
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:53,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground.</font>

678
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not even afraid of us.</font>

679
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 'cause they've never been hunted before.</font>

680
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's almost not fair.</font>

681
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want us back.</font>

682
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">They asked us to head for Command.</font>

683
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright. I gotta drop these off.</font>

684
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was arguably our favorite Tribute.</font>

685
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think that's what we
all find most astonishing,</font>

686
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that this girl was adored
in the Capitol.</font>

687
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think for you, Peeta,</font>

688
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">it must be particularly painful.</font>

689
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could give this rose to you, Katniss.</font>

690
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?</font>

691
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired</font>

692
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">such violence.</font>

693
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.</font>

694
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's shaking.</font>

695
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that I could.</font>

696
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless, of course, Peeta, you think
that perhaps she's being</font>

697
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">forced into saying</font>

698
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">things that she doesn't even understand.</font>

699
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:21,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. That's exactly what I think.</font>

700
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even his voice is different.</font>

701
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they're using her
to whip up the rebels.</font>

702
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt she even knows what's happening.</font>

703
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's really at stake.</font>

704
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this.</font>

705
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if they do, what would you say to her?</font>

706
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:39,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet
Katniss Everdeen.</font>

707
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would tell her to think for herself.</font>

708
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

709
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be a fool, Katniss.</font>

710
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you never wanted the rebellion.</font>

711
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:59,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The things that you did in the Games were
never intended to start all of this.</font>

712
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:02,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rebels have made you into something
that you're not.</font>

713
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something that could destroy all of us.</font>

714
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you have any power or any say</font>

715
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">in what they do or how they use you,</font>

716
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">please, please, urge them to stop this war</font>

717
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">before it's too late.</font>

718
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:19,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ask yourself,</font>

719
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">can you trust the people
you're working with?</font>

720
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:27,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what they really want?</font>

721
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to respond.</font>

722
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:31,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for these</font>

723
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">revelations about the real Mockingjay.</font>

724
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see what he looks like?</font>

725
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a coward.</font>

726
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have any idea what
he's going through.</font>

727
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care. I would never say
what he just said.</font>

728
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if they tortured me. Not
with a gun to my head.</font>

729
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the same Peeta that defended you
at the whipping post.</font>

730
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:51,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not. Now he's only
defending himself.</font>

731
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:55,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.</font>

732
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did "we" become you and Coin?</font>

733
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone has a choice.</font>

734
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can he sit there in the Capitol
and defend the people</font>

735
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">who destroyed his home and
murdered his family?</font>

736
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:07,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know.</font>

737
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could he?</font>

738
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's seen what the Capitol did to 12.</font>

739
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to show them.</font>

740
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I wanna start with you in front
of the Justice Building, okay?</font>

741
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bang. First shot.</font>

742
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, tell us what happened here.</font>

743
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were all standin' right here</font>

744
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:06,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">watchin' the Games when
you fired that arrow.</font>

745
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">The screens just went dark.</font>

746
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:10,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody had any idea what happened.</font>

747
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peacekeepers forced us back
into our homes.</font>

748
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">For maybe an hour, the town
was just dead quiet.</font>

749
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little past 9:00, we heard
their trucks pullin' out.</font>

750
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of them. Every single Peacekeeper.</font>

751
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:34,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I knew what that meant.</font>

752
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me and a couple of guys from the mines,</font>

753
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:42,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">we started pulling people
from their houses</font>

754
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tried to get 'em to the fence line</font>

755
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a lotta people were scared
of the forest.</font>

756
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they headed up onto the road.</font>

757
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a break for it that way.</font>

758
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with Gale.</font>

759
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">915 of us made it to the fence.</font>

760
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we watched as bombers circled back
towards the road.</font>

761
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:23,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">They firebombed them as they ran away.</font>

762
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">915 outta 10,000.</font>

763
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've grabbed people. I should've
dragged 'em with me.</font>

764
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the kids I could've carried.</font>

765
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved so many people, Gale.</font>

766
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:02,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without you, there would be no District 12.</font>

767
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even the memory of it.</font>

768
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where you kissed me.</font>

769
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think you remembered that.</font>

770
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have to be dead to forget that.</font>

771
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not even then.</font>

772
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you'd do that.</font>

773
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">How? I didn't.</font>

774
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:20,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I'm in pain.</font>

775
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the only way that
I can get your attention.</font>

776
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass.</font>

777
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

778
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's a mockingjay.</font>

779
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now they'll never shut up.</font>

780
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to sing?</font>

781
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">That line was originally
"necklace of rope".</font>

782
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had it changed to "necklace of hope".</font>

783
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. You are a true wordsmith.</font>

784
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little on the nose, but,
of course, so is war.</font>

785
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every district's seeing this?</font>

786
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. But not the Capitol.</font>

787
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I designed this signal defense system
for them.</font>

788
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:17,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't find my way through it.</font>

789
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I did my job too well.</font>

790
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the time, I was just thinking
of the science of it all.</font>

791
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get through it.</font>

792
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</font>

793
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they strung up a man they say
who murdered three.</font>

794
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange things did happen here.</font>

795
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stranger would it be.</font>

796
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:47,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we met at midnight in the hanging tree.</font>

797
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:51,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you, are you comin' to the tree?</font>

798
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:56,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee.</font>

799
01:09:57,079 --> 01:09:59,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange things did happen here.</font>

800
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:01,367

803
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, you're wanted in Command.</font>

804
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, we've received reports</font>

805
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,765

806
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">of granaries on fire,</font>

807
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">and of a savage attack on the hydroelectric dam
in District 5.</font>

808
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what have they done to you?</font>

809
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm begging for restraint and decency.</font>

810
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">We interrupt your regularly scheduled
horse manure</font>

811

01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,086

813
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. That's our footage.</font>

814

<font color="#FFFFFF">Beetee's in.</font>

815
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say who murdered three.</font>

01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

817
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:13,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sees it. He sees our propo.</font>

818
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stranger would it be...</font>

819
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,766

820
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

821
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,448

<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, please continue.</font>

823
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were telling us about</font>

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">these savage attacks.</font>

825
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

826
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:42,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">The attack on the dam was a callous</font>

827
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">and inhuman act of destruction...</font>

828
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,167

830

831
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can survive this.</font>

832
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,850

833
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not here in the Capitol.</font>

834
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:10,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in any of the districts.</font>

835
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:16,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming, Katniss.</font>

836
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,890

837
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in District 13, you'll
be dead by morning.</font>

840
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,319

- This is a code red alert.</font>

01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:19,726

<font color="#FFFFFF">one.</font>

920
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?</font>

921
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:47,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't gonna leave him behind.</font>

922
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:48,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't live with myself.</font>

923
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:51,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blast doors are now sealed.</font>

924
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, Prim.</font>

925
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

926
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damage to the aquifer in
the northwest quadrant.</font>

927
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost a transport corridor.</font>

928
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing else in the northwest.</font>

929
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our surface-to-air launchers just took</font>

930
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">a direct hit in sector 3.</font>

931
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:13,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we revealed ourselves.</font>

932
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:15,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">They saw us firing there.</font>

933
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand down. Don't launch the fleet.</font>

934
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:25,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching
sector 3 in attack formation.</font>

935
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:27,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold fire on their approach.</font>

936
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

937
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd they hit?</font>

938
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bedrock. But there's debris
in the ventilation shaft.</font>

939
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:36,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not targeting our fleet.</font>

940
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or our Special Weaponry.</font>

941
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't know what we have
or where we have it.</font>

942
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:42,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you confirm that everyone's
safely in the bunker?</font>

943
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:43,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Already done.</font>

944
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:47,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conceal all remaining anti-aircraft guns.</font>

945
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seal launching pads and
ventilation corridors.</font>

946
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are gonna wait this out.</font>

947
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what we're built for.</font>

948
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:55,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll seal us in here like a tomb.</font>

949
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Capitol's working off some
outdated information.</font>

950
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather not update it for them.</font>

951
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam President, I know
it's not my place...</font>

952
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not. You're a welcome guest, but
you're out of your depth down here.</font>

953
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:07,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it.</font>

954
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.</font>

955
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:11,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.</font>

956
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be a long night.</font>

957
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:54,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prim, talk about something. Anything.</font>

958
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">They promoted me at the hospital.</font>

959
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot to tell you.</font>

960
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're training me to be a doctor.</font>

961
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd be stupid not to.</font>

962
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

963
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I sit?</font>

964
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

965
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:34,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow's using Annie to punish you.</font>

966
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:37,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's taunting us with them.</font>

967
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't understand until just now,
watching that stupid cat.</font>

968
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">After your first Games,</font>

969
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:57,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the whole romance was an act.</font>

970
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all expected you to
continue that strategy.</font>

971
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it wasn't until Peeta's heart stopped
and he nearly died that</font>

972
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I'd misjudged you.</font>

973
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love him.</font>

974
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not saying in what way.</font>

975
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:20,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you don't even know yourself.</font>

976
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:23,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">But anyone paying attention can see it.</font>

977
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you live with it?</font>

978
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:32,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I drag myself outta nightmares and
there's no relief in waking up.</font>

979
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:37,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's better not to give in to it.</font>

980
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Takes 10 times longer to put yourself
back together</font>

981
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:43,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">than it does to fall apart.</font>

982
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss? Katniss?</font>

983
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

984
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:06,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took their best shot. Didn't we?</font>

985
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:09,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

986
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother and sister okay?</font>

987
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they're fine.</font>

988
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:15,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to do something for us.</font>

989
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:20,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to tell Panem that we survived
an attack by the Capitol</font>

990
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:21,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">with no casualties.</font>

991
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we remain fully operational.</font>

992
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:26,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

993
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:28,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should know something.</font>

994
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had eight extra minutes
of civilian evacuation</font>

995
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of Peeta's warning.</font>

996
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't forget that.</font>

997
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

998
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Katniss,</font>

999
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:59,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's "13 is alive and well and so am I".</font>

1000
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:02,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

1001
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss.</font>

1002
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never one to waste it
in rehearsal, I know.</font>

1003
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:16,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would they drop these?</font>

1004
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:21,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me.</font>

1005
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready to go, Katniss?</font>

1006
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna do this, just like District 8.</font>

1007
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about the roses.</font>

1008
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.</font>

1009
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna kill Peeta.</font>

1010
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's try again. Can you speak up?</font>

1011
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:50,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have a mic on you.</font>

1012
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">"13 is alive and well and so am I".</font>

1013
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna kill Peeta.</font>

1014
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

1015
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

1016
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:07,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do it, Katniss.</font>

1017
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this.</font>

1018
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">"13 is alive and well and so am I".</font>

1019
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just gonna keep...</font>

1020
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's never gonna stop.</font>

1021
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cressida, we should cut the cameras.</font>

1022
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:18,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As long as I'm the Mockingjay.
- It's okay, Katniss.</font>

1023
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He warned me. He warned me about this.</font>

1024
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:26,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's doing this because
I'm the Mockingjay.</font>

1025
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's punishing Peeta to punish me.</font>

1026
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1027
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:32,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't do this.</font>

1028
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss.</font>

1029
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make me do this!</font>

1030
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her go.</font>

1031
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta get out of here.</font>

1032
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is the end, huh?</font>

1033
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose you're just gonna
hide down here forever?</font>

1034
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:08,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be the Mockingjay.</font>

1035
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the Mockingjay. Just Katniss.</font>

1036
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:19,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you're the only real friend
I have down here.</font>

1037
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:28,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?</font>

1038
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're unbelievable.</font>

1039
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but I meant what I said.</font>

1040
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:36,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the reason I'm here
is to let you know</font>

1041
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:38,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're rescuing Peeta.</font>

1042
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:41,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1043
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:45,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dam went down in District 5, took out
most of the power to the Capitol.</font>

1044
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knocked out their signal defense.</font>

1045
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:51,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.</font>

1046
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:53,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">A window is open to us.</font>

1047
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much longer? I don't know.</font>

1048
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess until the Capitol can
get the power back on.</font>

1049
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And President Coin?</font>

1050
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I can never fully
support that woman</font>

1051
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">in light of the prohibition they have
going on around this place,</font>

1052
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Plutarch got word</font>

1053
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Peeta and the others
are in the Tribute Center.</font>

1054
01:29:12,439 --> 01:29:15,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with the power out, Coin
sees this as an opportunity.</font>

1055
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows that Peeta</font>

1056
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the Capitol's weapon. The same way
you're ours.</font>

1057
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:23,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as opposed to having you
two pointing at each other,</font>

1058
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:25,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's going to get him.</font>

1059
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:27,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go help.</font>

1060
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait.</font>

1061
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. What, are you just
gonna jump outta the vent</font>

1062
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">and go storm the Capitol?</font>

1063
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:35,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, it's already underway.</font>

1064
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:39,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only.</font>

1065
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">And guess who was the first
brave soul to sign up.</font>

1066
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale.</font>

1067
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

1068
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go in the center there. Those rocks.</font>

1069
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:06,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Castor, to left.</font>

1070
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pollux, you're with me.</font>

1071
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll go straight to camera.</font>

1072
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Finnick?</font>

1073
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:14,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1074
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1075
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your time.</font>

1076
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just remember to keep talking
and don't stop.</font>

1077
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Finnick Odair.</font>

1078
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.</font>

1079
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm coming to you from District 13,
alive and well.</font>

1080
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've survived an assault
from the Capitol.</font>

1081
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not here to give you recent news.</font>

1082
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is Finnick doing a propo?</font>

1083
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot more than that.</font>

1084
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:46,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beetee's commandeered the system.</font>

1085
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that they're down to generator power</font>

1086
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:50,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a more limited range of
frequencies available to them.</font>

1087
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:52,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm filling them all up with Finnick.</font>

1088
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not many will see it, but whoever does</font>

1089
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">will think it's another propo.</font>

1090
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they don't know is this broadcast</font>

1091
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">is jamming their entire system with noise.</font>

1092
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Early defense warning, internal
communications, everything.</font>

1093
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:03,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as the broadcast goes through,</font>

1094
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">our team should be able to
get in and out undetected.</font>

1095
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth. Not the myths about
a life of luxury.</font>

1096
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the lie about glory for your homeland.</font>

1097
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can survive the arena.</font>

1098
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:17,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">The moment you leave, you're a slave.</font>

1099
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One,</font>

1100
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:35,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are one minute out from
perimeter defense.</font>

1101
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going dark.</font>

1102
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay low in case they're on-line.</font>

1103
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow used to sell me.</font>

1104
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or my body, at least. I wasn't the only one.</font>

1105
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">If a Victor is considered desirable,</font>

1106
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:51,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">the President gives them as a reward
or allows people to buy them.</font>

1107
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you refuse, he kills someone you love.</font>

1108
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.</font>

1109
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten seconds.</font>

1110
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine... eight...</font>

1111
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:10,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">seven... six... five...</font>

1112
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">four... three... two...</font>

1113
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">one.</font>

1114
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">No response from perimeter defense.</font>

1115
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're inside Capitol airspace.</font>

1116
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:29,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make themselves feel better,</font>

1117
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">my patrons would make presents
of money or jewelry.</font>

1118
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I found a much more valuable form
of payment.</font>

1119
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secrets.</font>

1120
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gear up.</font>

1121
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Switching to Night View.</font>

1122
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

1123
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Command, we have visual
on the Tribute Center.</font>

1124
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Initiating final approach.</font>

1125
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:24,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Masks on.</font>

1126
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:33,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty</font>

1127
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the Capitol's pampered elite.</font>

1128
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:41,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the biggest secrets are about our
good President, Coriolanus Snow.</font>

1129
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door.</font>

1130
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Command, this is Team Leader.</font>

1131
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare to deploy gas. We
will confirm once inside.</font>

1132
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a young man when he rose to power.</font>

1133
01:34:10,279 --> 01:34:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a clever one to keep it.</font>

1134
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">How, you may ask, did he do it?</font>

1135
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:18,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">One word.</font>

1136
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:20,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poison.</font>

1137
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:28,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready to drop.</font>

1138
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:58,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stopped every mutiny
before it even started.</font>

1139
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear.</font>

1140
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear. Command, we're inside.</font>

1141
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heading toward target number one.</font>

1142
01:35:19,079 --> 01:35:21,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cell P45 lower level 2C.</font>

1143
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gas.</font>

1144
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are so many mysterious deaths</font>

1145
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:27,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">to adversaries.</font>

1146
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even to allies who were threats.</font>

1147
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow would drink from the same cup,</font>

1148
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:45,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deflect suspicion.</font>

1149
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">But antidotes don't always work,</font>

1150
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.</font>

1151
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:56,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.</font>

1152
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale.</font>

1153
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he can't hide the scent
of who he really is.</font>

1154
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">He kills without mercy.</font>

1155
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">He rules with deception and fear.</font>

1156
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">His weapon of choice is the only thing
suited to such a man.</font>

1157
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poison.</font>

1158
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:06,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The perfect weapon for a snake.</font>

1159
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

1160
01:37:21,479 --> 01:37:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Beetee?
- I'm losing them.</font>

1161
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:24,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Powering back up.</font>

1162
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, the Capitol air defense system</font>

1163
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:30,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">is rebooting. It's coming back on-line.</font>

1164
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:32,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be diverting power
from another source.</font>

1165
01:37:32,199 --> 01:37:33,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">And filtering transmissions.</font>

1166
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:34,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another 60 seconds and we'll be cut off.</font>

1167
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam President, should we call back
the hovercraft?</font>

1168
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broadcast me.</font>

1169
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Snow's watching this, maybe he'll
let the signal in,</font>

1170
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he sees me.</font>

1171
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me on the air so he can see me.</font>

1172
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes.</font>

1173
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:49,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put her on.</font>

1174
01:37:49,479 --> 01:37:51,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we do this? Can we still get in?</font>

1175
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. For the moment.</font>

1176
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:54,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">The line's open. He will only see you.</font>

1177
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Katniss, go.</font>

1178
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow?</font>

1179
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow. It's Katniss.</font>

1180
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no guarantee he's even watching.</font>

1181
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:04,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but he might be.</font>

1182
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:06,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow, I need to speak with you.</font>

1183
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you there?</font>

1184
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?</font>

1185
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to speak with you.</font>

1186
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:19,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow, it's Katniss.</font>

1187
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow,</font>

1188
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:22,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you there?</font>

1189
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you hear me?</font>

1190
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:34,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow...</font>

1191
01:38:34,199 --> 01:38:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen. What an honor.</font>

1192
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't imagine you're calling
to thank me for the roses.</font>

1193
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never asked for this.</font>

1194
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never asked to be in the Games.</font>

1195
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boggs? Come in. Boggs?</font>

1196
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:53,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never asked to be the Mockingjay.</font>

1197
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wanted to save my sister.</font>

1198
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">And keep Peeta alive.</font>

1199
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in. Boggs?</font>

1200
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, just let him go.</font>

1201
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will stop being the Mockingjay.</font>

1202
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:07,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will disappear. You will never
have to see me ever again.</font>

1203
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen.</font>

1204
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boggs, come in.</font>

1205
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't run from this...</font>

1206
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:13,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy.</font>

1207
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:15,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any more than you could have run
from the Games.</font>

1208
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Command, I need a situation report.</font>

1209
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boggs, we're running out of time. Hurry.</font>

1210
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move.</font>

1211
01:39:24,439 --> 01:39:25,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1212
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've won.</font>

1213
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've already beaten me.</font>

1214
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Release Peeta. And take me instead.</font>

1215
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're long past the opportunity
for noble sacrifice.</font>

1216
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then tell me what to do.</font>

1217
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always kept my promises, haven't I?</font>

1218
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you didn't want a war.</font>

1219
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's just what's happened.</font>

1220
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:59,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you what a fragile thing peace was.</font>

1221
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:04,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">And still, like a child, you took pleasure
in breaking it.</font>

1222
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:07,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you are.</font>

1223
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you can't see past
your narrowest concerns.</font>

1224
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">But please, Miss Everdeen.</font>

1225
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:17,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt you know what honesty is anymore.</font>

1226
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:18,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Command, we're at the first target.</font>

1227
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Preparing to extract Peeta.</font>

1228
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:21,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will confirm when he's in hand.</font>

1229
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mockingjay One, prepare hovercraft for evac.</font>

1230
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeta.</font>

1231
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:32,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't I at least done that?</font>

1232
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:34,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen,</font>

1233
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the things we love most</font>

1234
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">that destroy us.</font>

1235
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:48,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to remember that I said that.</font>

1236
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think I know your friends
are in the Tribute Center?</font>

1237
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut them off.</font>

1238
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:03,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Boggs, come in.</font>

1239
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

1240
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boggs, come in. Do you read me?</font>

1241
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows that they're in there.</font>

1242
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.</font>

1243
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:11,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get a hold of them.</font>

1244
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to tell them to get out. He knows.</font>

1245
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:15,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no signal. We can't contact them.</font>

1246
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:19,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.</font>

1247
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:20,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Haymitch. They're in there.</font>

1248
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we don't know that.</font>

1249
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I lose them both tonight?</font>

1250
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did I lose them both tonight?
- Shhh.</font>

1251
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:29,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I lose them? I lost them both.</font>

1252
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

1253
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no news.</font>

1254
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1255
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the worst torture in the world.</font>

1256
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waiting, when you know there's
nothing you can do.</font>

1257
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:05,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially for people like us.</font>

1258
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:11,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">But whatever strength, courage,</font>

1259
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">madness,</font>

1260
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">keeps us going, you find it,
at times like these.</font>

1261
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:22,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have it, soldier.</font>

1262
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:26,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what's kept you alive all this time.</font>

1263
01:42:27,479 --> 01:42:29,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it won't fail you now.</font>

1264
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're back.</font>

1265
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want that.</font>

1266
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna.</font>

1267
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:10,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1268
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1269
01:43:13,399 --> 01:43:16,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie? Annie!</font>

1270
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're safe. You're safe.</font>

1271
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale!</font>

1272
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:35,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

1273
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What is it?</font>

1274
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:39,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

1275
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every gun was back on-line</font>

1276
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">and on us and we flew right past them.</font>

1277
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:45,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">They let us go.</font>

1278
01:43:51,159 --> 01:43:52,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in there.</font>

1279
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:55,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gas we used on the guards</font>

1280
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">knocked him out, too, but
it's wearing off now.</font>

1281
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:02,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be there when he wakes up.</font>

1282
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:08,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1283
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1284
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:34,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

1285
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta!</font>

1286
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta! Get off! Get off of her!</font>

1287
01:45:14,199 --> 01:45:16,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go!</font>

1288
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:52,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Katniss. No, you're swollen.
Don't touch.</font>

1289
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:54,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Calm down.</font>

1290
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down. You're okay.</font>

1291
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her she's awake.</font>

1292
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:04,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't try to talk.</font>

1293
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta's okay. I promise.</font>

1294
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:08,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had to get him off you.</font>

1295
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called hijacking.</font>

1296
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:22,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know how long the Capitol's
been doing this to Peeta.</font>

1297
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:24,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fear conditioning.</font>

1298
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:26,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enhanced with tracker jacker venom.</font>

1299
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were stung your first Games. Remember?</font>

1300
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.</font>

1301
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they torture him.</font>

1302
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:41,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">With shocks and beatings, and
strip down his identity.</font>

1303
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then all of that suffering
and fear is redirected.</font>

1304
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Associated with other memories or a person.</font>

1305
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can change his memories of Katniss?</font>

1306
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make her seem life-threatening.</font>

1307
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">They turned him into a weapon, Katniss.</font>

1308
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">To kill you.</font>

1309
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can reverse it?</font>

1310
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fear is the most difficult thing
to overcome.</font>

1311
01:47:04,119 --> 01:47:06,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're hardwired to remember fear best.</font>

1312
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's new terrain.</font>

1313
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we've put together a team.</font>

1314
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm optimistic.</font>

1315
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

1316
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:45,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday, I authorized</font>

1317
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:48,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">a covert rescue mission
inside the Capitol.</font>

1318
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:51,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am pleased to announce</font>

1319
01:47:52,119 --> 01:47:55,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the Victors have been liberated!</font>

1320
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let this day mark an historic change.</font>

1321
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the Mockingjay and
the Victors beside us,</font>

1322
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:13,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have sent a clear message
to the Capitol.</font>

1323
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we will never again endure injustice.</font>

1324
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:24,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today,</font>

1325
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:28,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">a day on which we reunited family,</font>

1326
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:30,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">friends, and loved ones.</font>

1327
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let all of Panem come together.</font>

1328
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to battle for the amusement
of the Capitol.</font>

1329
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to join hands in this fight.</font>

1330
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:53,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let today be the day we promise</font>

1331
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">never to give up, never to give in</font>

1332
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we have made a new Panem,</font>

1333
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:03,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.</font>

1334
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where the districts are free</font>

1335
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">to share the fruits of their labors</font>

1336
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:11,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not fight one another for scraps!</font>

1337
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">This new Panem is on the horizon.</font>

1338
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we must take it for ourselves.</font>

1339
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">The road there leads through
the sharp mountains</font>

1340
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">and deep ravines of District 2.</font>

1341
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">There in the heart</font>

1342
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Panem's steepest mountain range lies</font>

1343
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Capitol's principal military facility.</font>

1344
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can conquer this stronghold</font>

1345
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we are one people,</font>

1346
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:56,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">one army, one voice.</font>

1347
01:49:56,720 --> 01:50:01,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because today is our new beginning.</font>

1348
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:05,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we have freed the Victors.</font>

1349
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:09,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, Panem!</font>

1350
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!</font>

1351

<font color="#FFFFFF">SubText: NoRMITA:326</font>
