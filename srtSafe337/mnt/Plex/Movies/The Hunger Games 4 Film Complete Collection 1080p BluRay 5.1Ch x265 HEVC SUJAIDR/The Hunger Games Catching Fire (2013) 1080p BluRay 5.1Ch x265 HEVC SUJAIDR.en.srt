1
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:37,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, whoa.</font>

2
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:39,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy.</font>

3
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saw some turkeys on the way here.</font>

4
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:51,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crossed right in front of me
like I wasn't even there.</font>

5
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:53,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How rude of them.
- That's what happens.</font>

6
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You spend six days a week
working in the mines</font>

7
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:59,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">and stupid birds start to
think they own these woods.</font>

8
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's the tour leave?</font>

9
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couple hours.</font>

10
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's go.</font>

11
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

12
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:06,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, whoa. You're okay.</font>

13
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're okay. You're safe. You're safe.</font>

14
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. You're here with me.</font>

15
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're with me.</font>

16
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:23,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

17
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

18
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we... We should...</font>

19
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go.</font>

20
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Are you coming
to the train station?</i></font>

21
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:00,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you have enough
people saying goodbye without me there.</font>

22
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a few I actually care about.</font>

23
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might be easier if I didn't.</font>

24
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only a few weeks.</font>

25
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be back before the snow melts.</font>

26
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:13,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a lot can happen in a few weeks.</font>

27
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we gonna do this again?</font>

28
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale, it was an act.</font>

29
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:20,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it was a good one.</font>

30
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I had to do to survive.</font>

31
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I didn't, I'd be dead.</font>

32
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to do that.</font>

33
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:38,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least once.</font>

34
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch!</font>

35
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch!</font>

36
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch, wake up. It's Tour Day.</font>

37
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch.</font>

38
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

39
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cameras are gonna be here in an hour.</font>

40
00:05:45,324 --> 00:05:48,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked Peeta.</font>

41
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Asked me what?</font>

42
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.</font>

43
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a strangely dislikeable person.</font>

44
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you do have your virtues.</font>

45
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:03,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like some bread, Katniss?</font>

46
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.</font>

47
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

48
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:09,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brr.</font>

49
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:13,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two have a lot
of warming up to do before show time.</font>

50
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is in an hour, so
take a bath, Haymitch.</font>

51
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just did.</font>

52
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you have a good walk, dear?</font>

53
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Walk? I was just out.
- We have visitors.</font>

54
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen. This way, please.</font>

55
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:53,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such bravery.</font>

56
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such spirit.</font>

57
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:57,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such...</font>

58
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:01,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contempt.</font>

59
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow.</font>

60
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">What an honor.</font>

61
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear, I think we can make
this so much simpler</font>

62
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we agree not to lie to each other.</font>

63
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:12,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

64
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I think that would save time.</font>

65
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:16,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, please.</font>

66
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.</font>

67
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">A problem that began
the moment you revealed</font>

68
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">those poison berries in the arena.</font>

69
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,</font>

70
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">had had any brains at all,</font>

71
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">he would have blown you
to bits then and there.</font>

72
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here you are.</font>

73
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:44,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you can guess where he is.</font>

74
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I think so.</font>

75
00:07:47,362 --> 00:07:49,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do</font>

76
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:52,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">but to let you play out
your little scenario.</font>

77
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you were very good.</font>

78
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:58,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.</font>

79
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impressive. Truly.</font>

80
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You convinced the people in The Capitol.</font>

81
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.</font>

82
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:10,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,</font>

83
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:13,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">people viewed your little
trick with the berries</font>

84
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an act of defiance.</font>

85
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as an act of love.</font>

86
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if a girl from
District 12 of all places</font>

87
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:23,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">can defy The Capitol
and walk away unharmed,</font>

88
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is to prevent them
from doing the same?</font>

89
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is to prevent, say,</font>

90
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:29,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">an uprising?</font>

91
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">That can lead to revolution.</font>

92
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:34,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, in a fraction of time,</font>

93
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:35,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">the whole system collapses.</font>

94
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be a fragile system,</font>

95
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:40,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.</font>

96
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is, indeed.</font>

97
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not in the way you imagine it.</font>

98
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">How should I imagine?</font>

99
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:49,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.</font>

100
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:53,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">This town of yours reduced to ashes.
Imagine it gone.</font>

101
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made radioactive. Buried under dirt</font>

102
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if it had never
existed, like District 13.</font>

103
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fought very hard
in The Games, Miss Everdeen.</font>

104
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they were games.</font>

105
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:10,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to be in a real war?</font>

106
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

107
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:14,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Neither would I.</font>

108
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your mother make these?</font>

109
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

110
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. He's a lovely boy.</font>

111
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me.</font>

112
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:29,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">At what point did he
realize the depth of your</font>

113
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">indifference towards him?</font>

114
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not indifferent.
- Don't lie!</font>

115
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:35,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised.</font>

116
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just kill me now?</font>

117
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:46,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to kill you.</font>

118
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want us to be friends.</font>

119
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:52,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if not friends, then allies.</font>

120
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:53,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I need to do?</font>

121
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:55,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you and Peeta are on tour,</font>

122
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:59,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to smile. You need to be grateful.</font>

123
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, above all,</font>

124
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to be madly,</font>

125
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">prepared-to-end-it-all in love.</font>

126
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can manage that?</font>

127
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

128
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:08,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, what?</font>

129
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:10,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll convince them.</font>

130
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

131
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Convince me.</font>

132
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you, Miss Everdeen.</font>

133
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do convince me.</font>

134
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the sake of your loved ones.</font>

135
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

136
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it all in.</font>

137
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is sacred ground.</font>

138
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">History was made here.</font>

139
00:10:58,678 --> 00:10:59,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

140
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:02,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get used to the smell.</font>

141
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

142
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello!</font>

143
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

144
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is. My greatest triumph!</font>

145
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our little superstar.</font>

146
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:13,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetie, we've missed you.</font>

147
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a cute little house.</font>

148
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:16,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">So quaint, isn't it?</font>

149
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:19,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you've heard about Cinna?</font>

150
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:20,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to Cinna?</font>

151
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:24,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
You're his muse.</font>

152
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him.
Everyone.</font>

153
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everyone.
- Well, not everyone.</font>

154
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

155
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna!</font>

156
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:34,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

157
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:37,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, is this your sister?</font>

158
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sweetie!</font>

159
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:40,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

160
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just adorable!</font>

161
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Ready to work?</font>

162
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- All right. Good.</font>

163
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome!</font>

164
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:55,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year, the 74th Hunger Games</font>

165
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">brought us the greatest
love story of our time.</font>

166
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two brave young people, against all odds</font>

167
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:05,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">chose to die rather than
to lose each other.</font>

168
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:08,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a nation, we shared their agony.</font>

169
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:13,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we had so little time
to revel in their joy.</font>

170
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time!</font>

171
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:18,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's done, she's lovely.
We must feed the monster.</font>

172
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:19,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right now.</font>

173
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:21,009
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Let's go to District 12</i></font>

174
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,553
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and find our star-crossed lovers!</i></font>

175
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're excited. You're in love.</font>

176
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:27,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.</font>

177
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,604
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There she is! Katniss Everdeen!</i></font>

178
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:31,772
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Girl on Fire.</i></font>

179
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And there he is! Peeta Mellark!</i></font>

180
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Baker's Boy.</i></font>

181
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:50,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

182
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,792
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Uh-oh. Whoa, oh.</i></font>

183
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,626
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Trouble in paradise</i></font>

184
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:55,962
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hope they're all right.</i></font>

185
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:00,466
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Um...</i>
- Ahem.</font>

186
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:01,842
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Anyone at home?</i></font>

187
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:03,323
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Should we come back later?</i></font>

188
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:05,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Caesar.</font>

189
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please. It's all right. It's your day.</font>

190
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:11,269
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's your day. So how's it going?</i></font>

191
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're good.</font>

192
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,567
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's it? That's all we get? "We're good"?</i></font>

193
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:21,238
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So taciturn all of a sudden.
Peeta, give me some details!</i></font>

194
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, things are, uh...
Things are great here in 12.</font>

195
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:30,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol,</font>

196
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:31,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've never been closer.</font>

197
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:34,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">25 yards, to be exact.</font>

198
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:36,753
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fantastic!</i></font>

199
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be checking in with both of you</font>

200
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:40,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">throughout the Victory Tour.</font>

201
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:41,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thank you so much,</i></font>

202
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,342
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</i></font>

203
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:47,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful!</font>

204
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:49,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody in motion. We
are out of here in 10.</font>

205
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was nice acting.</font>

206
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:53,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too.</font>

207
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:56,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost thought that kiss was real.</font>

208
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along, children,
we are on a schedule.</font>

209
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">The train awaits!</font>

210
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fabulous food, fabulous wine,</font>

211
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">the massages, spa treatments. I told them</font>

212
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">nothing but the best for my two Victors.</font>

213
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all needs to be, uh...</font>

214
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:13,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fabulous?</font>

215
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:14,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

216
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear.</font>

217
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">12 days, 12 districts.</font>

218
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:21,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's mostly parties, celebrations,</font>

219
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:24,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way,</font>

220
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we wrap it up in The Capitol.</font>

221
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you need to do is give a few speeches,</font>

222
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">wave to the crowds,</font>

223
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">and enjoy your time in the spotlight.</font>

224
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:33,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've earned it.</font>

225
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:35,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

226
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:36,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss.</font>

227
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:41,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss,
you've earned it."</font>

228
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">By killing people.</font>

229
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young lady...</font>

230
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really not in the mood for a lecture.</font>

231
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll apologize to Effie later.</font>

232
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were Haymitch.</font>

233
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to apologize to anybody.</font>

234
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Including me.</font>

235
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:23,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's not fair of me</font>

236
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hold you to things
you said in The Games.</font>

237
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved us. I know that.</font>

238
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't go on acting for the cameras,</font>

239
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then just ignoring
each other in real life.</font>

240
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you can stop looking
at me like I'm wounded,</font>

241
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I can quit acting like it.</font>

242
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:48,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then maybe we have
a shot at being friends.</font>

243
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been very good at friends.</font>

244
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">For starters, it does help
when you know the person.</font>

245
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hardly know anything about you</font>

246
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">except that you're stubborn
and good with a bow.</font>

247
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">That about sums me up.</font>

248
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there's more than that,
you just don't want to tell me.</font>

249
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I said, I'm...</font>

250
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, Katniss, the way
the whole friend thing works is you have to</font>

251
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell each other the deep stuff.</font>

252
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:11,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The deep stuff?
- Yeah.</font>

253
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh. Like what?</font>

254
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:14,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, uh...</font>

255
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your favorite color?</font>

256
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you've stepped over the line.</font>

257
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, though, what is it?</font>

258
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green.</font>

259
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's yours?</font>

260
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orange.</font>

261
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Effie's hair?</font>

262
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Not that orange.</font>

263
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:36,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">More, uh... More like a
sunset kind of orange.</font>

264
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:50,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see that?</font>

265
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

266
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

267
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:17,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I never.</font>

268
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not very festive.</font>

269
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mayor will make
some introductory remarks.</font>

270
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you just have to say a few words.</font>

271
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:29,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's customary, of course,
to give a brief eulogy</font>

272
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the district's fallen Tributes.</font>

273
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:34,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 11, that's Thresh and Rue.</font>

274
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here are the speeches.</font>

275
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do the talking if you want.</font>

276
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

277
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i></font>

278
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games.</font>

279
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:51,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</font>

280
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile, smile, smile, smile.</font>

281
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand up straight. You're on camera.</font>

282
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

283
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're honored to be here with you today.</font>

284
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:12,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to be with the families
of your fallen Tributes.</font>

285
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:24,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put down the cards.</font>

286
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,291
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Though they fought...</i></font>

287
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,419
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- ... and lived with honor...</i>
- Why do I bother?</font>

288
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,796
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and dignity until the end,</i></font>

289
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">both Thresh and Rue</font>

290
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">were so young.</font>

291
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:39,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our lives aren't
just measured in years.</font>

292
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:44,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.</font>

293
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">For myself,</font>

294
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:49,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">for Katniss,</font>

295
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:57,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">we know that without
Rue and without Thresh,</font>

296
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:59,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't be standing here today.</font>

297
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in recognition of that,</font>

298
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">knowing that it in no way
can make up for your loss,</font>

299
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd like to donate
one month of our winnings</font>

300
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the families of the
Tributes, every year,</font>

301
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:12,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the rest of our lives.</font>

302
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

303
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can he do that?</font>

304
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't. But he did.</font>

305
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why doesn't
he just stick to the cards?</font>

306
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:24,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

307
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to say that</font>

you to make them believe it?</font>

00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:02,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try one of these. They are divine.</font>

462
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't eat another thing.</font>

463
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here.
- What's this?</font>

464
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for when you're full.</font>

465
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes you sick.</font>

466
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:12,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can go on eating.</font>

467
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">How else could you taste everything?</font>

468
00:28:16,715 --> 00:28:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's time for a dance.</font>

469
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:20,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss?</font>

470
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:33,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are starving in 12.</font>

471
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:37,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, they're just throwing
it up to stuff more in.</font>

472
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:38,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss? Peeta.</font>

473
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Plutarch Heavensbee.
Head Gamemaker.</font>

474
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:45,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Successor to Seneca Crane.</font>

475
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:47,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a tough act to follow.</font>

476
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:49,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta!</font>

477
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:52,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I?</font>

478
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:54,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

479
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:04,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how do you like the party?</font>

480
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little overwhelming.</font>

481
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's appalling.</font>

482
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, if you abandon your moral judgment,
it can be fun.</font>

483
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">So are you having fun?</font>

484
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:20,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job.</font>

485
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:24,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane. Too much fun.</font>

486
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:29,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seneca decided to quit breathing.</font>

487
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:30,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Decided.</font>

488
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:33,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was that or poison berries.</font>

489
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being Head Gamemaker has never been</font>

490
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most secure job in the world.</font>

491
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:40,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you here?</font>

492
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same reason as you. I volunteered.</font>

493
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

494
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:47,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambition.</font>

495
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chance to make The Games
mean something.</font>

496
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Games don't mean anything.</font>

497
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:57,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">They only mean to scare us.</font>

498
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back.</font>

499
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

500
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Presidential welcome.</font>

501
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:10,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we'll meet again.</font>

502
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, come. The President awaits.</font>

503
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think we convinced him?</font>

504
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:19,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure what else we can do.</font>

505
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:35,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight,</font>

506
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">on this, the last day of their tour,</font>

507
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to welcome our two Victors.</font>

508
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:47,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two young people who embody our ideals</font>

509
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:50,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">of strength and valor.</font>

510
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:57,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I, personally, want
to congratulate them</font>

511
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:00,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the announcement of their engagement.</font>

512
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:06,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your love has inspired us.</font>

513
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:11,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know it will go on inspiring us</font>

514
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day</font>

515
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:16,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">for as long as you may live.</font>

516
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:31,971
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Look at them.</i></font>

517
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not who they think she is.</font>

518
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:35,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not a leader.</font>

519
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just wants to save her own skin.
It's as simple as that.</font>

520
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's true.</font>

521
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion.</font>

522
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she has to be eliminated.</font>

523
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:49,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree she should die.
But in the right way.</font>

524
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the right time.</font>

525
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's moves and countermoves.
And it's all we gotta look at.</font>

526
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.
Their Mockingjay.</font>

527
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:59,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think she's one of them.</font>

528
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to show that she's one of us.</font>

529
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't need to destroy her.
Just the image.</font>

530
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:05,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we let the people do the rest.</font>

531
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you propose?</font>

532
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:08,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut down the black markets.</font>

533
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:10,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take away what little they have.</font>

534
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:12,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then double the amount
of floggings and executions.</font>

535
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:16,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put them on TV. Broadcast them live.</font>

536
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sow fear. More fear.</font>

537
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't work. Fear does not
work as long as they have hope.</font>

538
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope.</font>

539
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:26,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's engaged.</font>

540
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make everything about that.</font>

541
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:31,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kinda dress is she gonna wear?
Floggings.</font>

542
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the cake gonna look like?
Executions.</font>

543
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's gonna be there? Fear.</font>

544
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces.</font>

545
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:40,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show them that she is one of us now.</font>

546
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:43,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna hate her so much,</font>

547
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">they might just kill her for you</font>

548
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant.</font>

549
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:01,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you...</font>

550
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:09,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk.</font>

551
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:15,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we gonna run away?</font>

552
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Into the woods. Like we
always talked about.</font>

553
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:19,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we leave right now,</font>

554
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can be far away from here by tonight.</font>

555
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:22,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, who's "we"?</font>

556
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:23,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, me and your fiancé?</font>

557
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just me and Peeta any more.</font>

558
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:29,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow threatened to have you killed.</font>

559
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone else?</font>

560
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list</font>

561
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:36,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">but a good guess,
it includes both of our families.</font>

562
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:38,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless what? You and Peeta get married?</font>

563
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:40,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless nothing now.</font>

564
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:41,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale, we can do it.</font>

565
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said yourself that we could do
it the morning of the Reaping.</font>

566
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:47,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say now?</font>

567
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you love me?</font>

568
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale, you know how I feel about you.</font>

569
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't think about
anyone that way right now.</font>

570
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing that I can think about</font>

571
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day, every waking moment</font>

572
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:59,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.</font>

573
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:02,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no room for anything else.</font>

574
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:04,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe, if we got away from here,</font>

575
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.</font>

576
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could be different.</font>

577
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think maybe the President's bluffing?</font>

578
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not bluffing.</font>

579
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not with what's going on in the districts.</font>

580
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

581
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:18,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see?</font>

582
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:22,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,</font>

583
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:24,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Peacekeepers were gunning them down,</font>

584
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the people were...</font>

585
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:27,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? The people were what?</font>

586
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:28,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were fighting back.</font>

587
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:31,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's happening.</font>

588
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's finally happening.</font>

589
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:36,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've just eaten
the berries in the arena</font>

590
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">and died like I was supposed to.</font>

591
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:40,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then everything would be back
to normal and everyone would be safe.</font>

592
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:41,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Safe for what?</font>

593
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">To starve? Work like slaves?</font>

594
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:45,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send their kids to the Reaping?</font>

595
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't hurt people, Katniss.</font>

596
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've given them an opportunity.</font>

597
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just have to be
brave enough to take it.</font>

598
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:54,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's already talk in the mines.
People wanna fight.</font>

599
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go, Gale, before they kill us.</font>

600
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:57,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">They Will kill us.</font>

601
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:00,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the other families? Huh?</font>

602
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:03,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones who stay. What happens to them?</font>

603
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:04,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are looking to you, Katniss.</font>

604
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want anyone looking to me.</font>

605
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't help them.</font>

606
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do what you want.</font>

607
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:22,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm staying here.</font>

608
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Thread,</font>

609
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">welcome to District 12.</font>

610
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get to work.</font>

611
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go! Keep moving!
- Stay close!</font>

612
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,135

615
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:00,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripper!</font>

616
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:01,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">My eye!</font>

617
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get you out of here.</font>

618
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

619
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:06,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave her be! Stop!</font>

620
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

621
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the square.</font>

622
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:28,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

623
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, hold that on there.</font>

624
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:54,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

625
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:57,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! Stop!</font>

00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:04,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss!</font>

627
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:06,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

628
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go. It's okay.</font>

629
00:39:15,748 --> 00:39:16,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move.</font>

630
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want another?</font>

631
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:21,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

632
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get out of my way!</font>

633
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't want to shoot her.</font>

634
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about I shoot both of you?</font>

635
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:29,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Commander, you're new here.</font>

636
00:39:29,387 --> 00:39:31,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me, I'm trying to help you.</font>

637
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Haymitch.</font>

638
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:36,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen.</font>

639
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:37,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darling of The Capitol.</font>

640
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">She interfered with a Peacekeeper.</font>

641
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said she was smart.</font>

642
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:48,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you already got
a couple of lashes in, right?</font>

643
00:39:48,574 --> 00:39:50,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not good enough. She's an agitator.</font>

644
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:52,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, easy.</font>

645
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:53,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look...</font>

646
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure Snow
wants three dead Victors here?</font>

647
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's what we're looking at.</font>

648
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad enough that you marked up her face</font>

649
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the eve of the big wedding.</font>

650
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:04,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it go. And we will, too.</font>

651
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

652
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:19,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

653
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:25,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">But next time, it's the firing squad.</font>

654
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent idea.</font>

655
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care who she is.</font>

656
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:33,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear the square!</font>

657
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:37,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all under curfew.</font>

658
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:41,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone out after dark</font>

659
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be shot on sight.</font>

660
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get 'em outta here.</font>

661
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:56,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Gale.</font>

662
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him here.</font>

663
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:01,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

664
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:04,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really easy. Up, up</font>

665
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:06,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

666
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Thanks.</font>

667
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:09,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">New head Peacekeeper.</font>

668
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:11,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not entirely peaceful.</font>

669
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missed your eye. Doesn't need stitches.</font>

670
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:14,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a snow coat.</font>

671
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, get the snow. I'll grind the herbs.</font>

672
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? That's hurting him.</font>

673
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:21,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs morphling.</font>

674
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:26,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

675
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:40,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom. No. I'll do it.</font>

676
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

677
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold him, please.</font>

678
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's better.</font>

679
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Catnip.</font>

680
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

681
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:32,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you'd be gone by now.</font>

682
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:34,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

683
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna stay right here.
Cause all kinds of trouble.</font>

684
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, too.</font>

685
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:08,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

686
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna get some rest?</font>

687
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can look after him for a while.</font>

688
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:20,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get him more snow.</font>

689
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:50,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

690
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:52,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your eye?</font>

691
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:55,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my eye that's bothering me.</font>

692
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:58,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can we live like this?</font>

693
00:43:58,322 --> 00:44:00,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can anybody live like this?</font>

694
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:02,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not living, but...</font>

695
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:07,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the last Games,
something is different.</font>

696
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see it.</font>

697
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can you see?</font>

698
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:15,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope.</font>

699
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:21,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand that whatever
I do comes back to you and Mom.</font>

700
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:24,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you to get hurt.</font>

701
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to protect me. Or Mom.</font>

702
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're with you.</font>

703
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:42,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

704
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, too.</font>

705
00:44:45,704 --> 00:44:48,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">The broadcast cut out here.</font>

706
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:50,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before any of the excitement happened.</font>

707
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many people saw it?</font>

708
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:55,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard to say. There was a five second delay,</font>

709
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it happened fast.</font>

710
00:44:57,632 --> 00:45:00,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen,</font>

711
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I will have to terminate her.</font>

712
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that.</font>

713
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:06,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not just her.</font>

714
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:13,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her entire species has to be eliminated.</font>

715
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:14,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her species, sir?</font>

716
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other Victors.</font>

717
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:20,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.</font>

718
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:22,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of her,</font>

719
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:25,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">they all think they're invincible.</font>

720
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:28,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever game you think you're playing,</font>

721
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:32,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">those out there are not
playing it with you.</font>

722
00:45:34,043 --> 00:45:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a way we can still win.</font>

723
00:45:38,757 --> 00:45:41,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what we Gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."</font>

724
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

725
00:45:51,603 --> 00:45:56,525

751
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:54,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally did the math, huh?</font>

752
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:56,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've come to, what?</font>

753

00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:42,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, if...</font>

769
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they call his name,
I'll volunteer in his place.</font>

770
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:49,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch, thank you.</font>

771
00:48:50,072 --> 00:48:53,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they call my name and Peeta volunteers,</font>

772
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing I can do.</font>

773
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:59,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.</font>

774
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah...</font>

775
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think these Games are gonna be different.</font>

776

777
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:09,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta lives. Not me.</font>

778
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:13,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me.</font>

779
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:17,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

780
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:26,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should've gone when you said.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you guys to forget</font>

834
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:52,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything you think you know
about The Games.</font>

835

<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year was child's play.</font>

836
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:58,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.</font>

837
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:01,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. What does that mean for us?</font>

838
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.</font>

839
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I think that if...</font>

840
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoop. You're not the problem.</font>

841
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:09,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

842
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:13,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you're starting at a disadvantage.</font>

843
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:15,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of these people
have been friends for years.</font>

844
00:54:15,773 --> 00:54:17,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">That just puts us higher
on their kill list.</font>

845
00:54:17,942 --> 00:54:20,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it your own way, but
I know these people.</font>

846
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:22,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go it alone,</font>

847
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:25,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.</font>

848
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:26,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of you.</font>

849
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:28,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, come on.</font>

850
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could any of us even trust each other?</font>

851
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.</font>

852
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:42,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cashmere and Gloss.</font>

853
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother and sister. District 1.</font>

854
00:54:44,594 --> 00:54:47,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.</font>

855
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of sponsors. They will be lethal.</font>

856
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the other half of the Career Pack,</font>

857
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:54,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brutus and Enobaria.</font>

858
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:55,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with her teeth?</font>

859
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:58,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.</font>

860
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:00,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's committed. I'll give her that.</font>

861
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:03,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wiress and Beetee. Not
fighters, but brilliant.</font>

862
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And weird. Real tech-savvy.</font>

863
00:55:06,657 --> 00:55:08,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won his Games by electrocuting</font>

864
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:09,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">six Tributes at once.</font>

865
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:12,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Morphlings. Masters of camouflage.</font>

866
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.</font>

867
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:18,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.</font>

868
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a threat.</font>

869
00:55:21,255 --> 00:55:22,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick Odair, right?</font>

870
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. He won his Games at 14. Youngest ever.</font>

871
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:27,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.</font>

872
00:55:27,637 --> 00:55:30,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'm kidding. He's a peacock.</font>

873
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:31,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">A total preener.</font>

874
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:34,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.</font>

875
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:35,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charming, smart,</font>

876
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:39,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.</font>

877
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:40,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about weaknesses?</font>

878
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:41,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">One. Mags.</font>

879
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:43,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">She volunteered for Annie.</font>

880
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:46,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.</font>

881
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:50,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he's trying to protect her in any way,
it exposes him.</font>

882
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.</font>

883
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.</font>

884
00:55:54,956 --> 00:55:57,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Katniss, I just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.</font>

885
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:01,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's actually a wonderful lady.</font>

886
00:56:26,737 --> 00:56:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd we get here, huh?</font>

887
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:30,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss.</font>

888
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:32,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Finnick.</font>

889
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want a sugar cube?</font>

890
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:38,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...</font>

891
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:39,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, who cares about them, right?</font>

892
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:42,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...</font>

893
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.</font>

894
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:48,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No thanks. But I would love
to borrow that outfit someday.</font>

895
00:56:49,092 --> 00:56:51,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look pretty terrifying in that getup.</font>

896
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:52,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to the
pretty little girl dresses?</font>

897
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:54,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I outgrew them.</font>

898
00:56:54,472 --> 00:56:55,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You certainly did.</font>

899
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame about this Quell thing.</font>

900
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:00,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you...</font>

901
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could've made out
like a bandit in The Capitol.</font>

902
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:04,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jewels, money, anything you wanted.</font>

903
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:07,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't like jewels
and I have more money than I need, so...</font>

904
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do
with all your wealth, anyway?</font>

905
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:12,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.</font>

906
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:15,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company?</font>

907
00:57:18,496 --> 00:57:19,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">With secrets.</font>

908
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:24,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you, Girl on Fire?</font>

909
00:57:25,128 --> 00:57:27,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any secrets worth my time?</font>

910
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:29,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an open book.</font>

911
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:31,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody always seems to know my secrets</font>

912
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:32,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">before I know them myself.</font>

913
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:35,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, I think that's true.</font>

914
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:40,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding.</font>

915
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:44,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how devastating
that must be for you.</font>

916
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:48,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good day.</font>

917
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Peeta.
- Finnick.</font>

918
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:55,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd he want?</font>

919
00:57:55,867 --> 00:57:57,369

921
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:02,331

922
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">No waving and smiling, this time.</font>

923
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:05,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to look straight ahead</font>

924
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:07,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if the audience and this
whole event are beneath you.</font>

925
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:10,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should be easy.</font>

926
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Press this when you're ready.</font>

927
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

928
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:39,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come!</font>

929
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:41,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">From District 12. Our favorites.</font>

930
00:58:41,746 --> 00:58:43,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well...
- Or my favorite.</font>

931
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:25,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is!</font>

932
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

933
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire in the house!</font>

934
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:33,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss! Katniss! Katniss!</font>

935
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:59,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. Way to make friends
out there, you two.</font>

936
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:00,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we learned from the best.</font>

937
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:03,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna introduce you to some
special friends of mine.</font>

938
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Seeder. And Chaff.</font>

939
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:06,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">From District 11.</font>

940
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:08,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

941
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:11,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's very friendly.</font>

942
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't invite him over.
He'll drink up your liquor.</font>

943
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you guys soon.</font>

944
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get some of that makeup off you</font>

945
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:20,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">and talk about these other Tributes.</font>

946
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:23,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">These Tributes are crazy.</font>

947
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:25,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not all of 'em. He's a good guy.</font>

948
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:27,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carry on.</font>

949
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys look amazing.</font>

950
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

951
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">My stylist is such an idiot.</font>

952
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:43,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">District 7. Lumber. Trees. Ugh!</font>

953
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:46,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to put my ax in her face.</font>

954
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:49,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you think?</font>

955
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?</font>

956
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:53,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
that the whole world...</font>

957
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't talking to you.</font>

958
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:55,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

959
01:00:55,672 --> 01:00:56,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you unzip?</font>

960
01:00:57,675 --> 01:00:58,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

961
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:27,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Let's do it again sometime.</font>

962
01:01:27,538 --> 01:01:28,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

963
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna Mason, District 7.</font>

964
01:01:36,213 --> 01:01:39,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, Katniss,
today's about making allies.</font>

965
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:46,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far I'm not overwhelmed by our choices.</font>

966
01:01:48,474 --> 01:01:50,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we just try
to figure out who we trust least</font>

967
01:01:50,894 --> 01:01:53,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">and work our way backwards from there.</font>

968
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:36,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friction generates heat.</font>

969
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:39,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heat generates fire. In theory.</font>

970
01:02:39,525 --> 01:02:41,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should move your hands downward.</font>

971
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And faster, too.</font>

972
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:58,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A little brute force...
- Is always helpful.</font>

973
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:01,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

974
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:03,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the corner of the table.</font>

975
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:05,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch?</font>

976
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:08,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Next to him.</font>

977
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:11,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Force field.</font>

978
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:12,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know?</font>

979
01:03:12,476 --> 01:03:13,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shimmering.</font>

980
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:17,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Top left hand side.</font>

981
01:03:18,773 --> 01:03:19,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

982
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:21,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

983
01:03:22,902 --> 01:03:23,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see it?</font>

984
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like glass.</font>

985
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">To separate us and them.</font>

986
01:03:29,742 --> 01:03:30,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably my fault.</font>

987
01:03:30,994 --> 01:03:32,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shot an arrow at them last year.</font>

988
01:03:32,788 --> 01:03:34,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh... Electromagnetic.</font>

989
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:35,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you tell?</font>

990
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:39,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it... Is it obvious or something?</font>

991
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:42,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Is it obvious?"</font>

992
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">They might as well have a sign.</font>

993
01:03:45,592 --> 01:03:46,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around you.</font>

994
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the holograms, the lights,</font>

995
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:50,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">every now and then they flicker. Why?</font>

996
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the force field
is taking up too much energy.</font>

997
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always a flaw in the system.</font>

998
01:04:08,364 --> 01:04:09,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's beautiful.</font>

999
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:12,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you volunteer for that young girl.</font>

1000
01:04:13,786 --> 01:04:15,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was really brave.</font>

1001
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:25,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prim is my sister.</font>

1002
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:29,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you, um...</font>

1003
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:33,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you teach me how to make a fishhook like
that I could teach you how to hunt.</font>

1004
01:04:36,018 --> 01:04:37,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes.</font>

1005
01:04:40,898 --> 01:04:42,259
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do you wanna try with me?</i></font>

1006
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:44,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1007
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:45,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go first.</font>

1008
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,300
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Good news.</i></font>

1009
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:55,597

want you as an ally.</font>

1010
01:05:55,806 --> 01:05:57,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they saw her shoot.</font>

1011
01:05:57,891 --> 01:06:00,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, sweetheart,
you got your pick of the litter.</font>

1012
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:01,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want Wiress and Beetee.</font>

1013
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:03,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna calls them "Nuts" and "Volts."</font>

1014
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:05,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, okay, good. Now, who else?</font>

1015
01:06:05,898 --> 01:06:06,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mags.</font>

1016
01:06:08,985 --> 01:06:10,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, fine, then no one.</font>

1017
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell them you're still
making up your mind.</font>

1018

1021
01:06:57,576 --> 01:07:00,411

1023
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:39,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen.</font>

1024
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:44,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Everdeen!</font>

1025
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,710

<font color="#FFFFFF">24 of Panem's brightest stars</font>

1033

1037
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:29,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">And heartbreakingly</font>

1038
01:09:31,854 --> 01:09:36,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">to say goodbye to all but one.</font>

1039

01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:47,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so exciting!</font>

1042
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wedding dress?</font>

1043
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:55,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow insisted,
but I made a few alterations.</font>

01:11:18,502 --> 01:11:20,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all eternity</font>

1074
01:11:21,213 --> 01:11:22,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if...</font>

1075
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:25,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I die in that arena,</font>

1076
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">my last thought will be of your lips.</font>

1077
01:11:31,099 --> 01:11:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have seen a lot of tears here tonight.</font>

1078
01:11:34,478 --> 01:11:36,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I see no tears in Johanna's eyes.</font>

1079
01:11:36,313 --> 01:11:38,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna, you are angry.</font>

1080
01:11:38,064 --> 01:11:39,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me why.</font>

1081
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes, I'm angry.</font>

1082
01:11:41,818 --> 01:11:43,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
I'm getting totally screwed over here.</font>

1083
01:11:43,904 --> 01:11:46,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-huh. - The deal was that
if I win the Hunger Games,</font>

1084
01:11:46,155 --> 01:11:48,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get to live the rest of my life in peace.</font>

1085
01:11:48,908 --> 01:11:51,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm-hmm.
- But now you want to kill me again.</font>

1086
01:11:52,912 --> 01:11:54,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know what?</font>

1087
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:55,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">That!</font>

1088
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:58,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everybody that had
anything to do with it!</font>

1089
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right then.</font>

1090
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">One woman's opinion.</font>

1091
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:04,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's next?</font>

1092
01:12:04,341 --> 01:12:05,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, turn around.</font>

1093
01:12:05,675 --> 01:12:08,929
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know
it's a bad break for everyone involved</i></font>

1094
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm done.</font>

1095
01:12:11,931 --> 01:12:13,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I be twirling tonight?</font>

1096
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it for the end.</font>

1097
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:17,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">One minute. Is she ready?</font>

1098
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Katniss.</font>

1099
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:25,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

1100
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:30,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have been
the most beautiful bride.</font>

1101
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:32,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1102
01:12:33,036 --> 01:12:34,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go show them</font>

1103
01:12:35,788 --> 01:12:37,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">what real beauty looks like.</font>

1104
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:39,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has to go more up.</font>

1105
01:12:40,126 --> 01:12:42,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, pretty, pretty,
Katniss, they're going to adore you.</font>

1106
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:45,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there are a lot of
sponsors in the audience,</font>

1107
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:48,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">so of course, just be your usual self.</font>

1108
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, be your happier self.</font>

1109
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? A wedding dress?</font>

1110
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:54,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow made me wear it.</font>

1111
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:59,395
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i></font>

1112
01:12:59,645 --> 01:13:01,230
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- You know her...</i>
- Make him pay for it.</font>

1113
01:13:01,355 --> 01:13:02,399
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>as the Girl on Fire.</i></font>

1114
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:05,234
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Victor of last year's Hunger Games.</i></font>

1115
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:07,903
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Katniss Everdeen!</i></font>

1116
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen,</font>

1117
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:26,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">you look fabulous. Doesn't she?</font>

1118
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:33,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">My, my!</font>

1119
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:34,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo, whoo, whoo.</font>

1120
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Katniss,</font>

1121
01:13:37,057 --> 01:13:38,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is</font>

1122
01:13:40,103 --> 01:13:44,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">a very big and very emotional night</font>

1123
01:13:45,024 --> 01:13:47,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all of us. Wouldn't you say?</font>

1124
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't go crying on me now, Caesar.</font>

1125
01:13:50,363 --> 01:13:51,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't make any promises. You know me.</font>

1126
01:13:52,114 --> 01:13:54,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I wouldn't
believe you, even if you did.</font>

1127
01:13:54,743 --> 01:13:57,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love her!
The Girl on Fire is so cheeky.</font>

1128
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:00,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Katniss,</font>

1129
01:14:01,082 --> 01:14:02,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a more serious note</font>

1130
01:14:05,086 --> 01:14:07,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're all here
a little disappointed,</font>

1131
01:14:07,463 --> 01:14:08,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than a little disappointed,</font>

1132
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:12,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a certain wedding did not take place.</font>

1133
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't we, folks?</font>

1134
01:14:15,387 --> 01:14:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw...</font>

1135
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:20,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alas. But am I correct in assuming</font>

1136
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:24,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this is the gown
that you would have worn</font>

1137
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">on that day, yes or no?</font>

1138
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:30,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, President Snow thought
everyone would want to see it.</font>

1139
01:14:31,154 --> 01:14:34,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow, as usual, was right.</font>

1140
01:14:34,448 --> 01:14:36,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he not, folks?</font>

1141
01:14:36,408 --> 01:14:38,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it! I love it!</font>

1142
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:39,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you love it, folks?</font>

1143
01:14:39,453 --> 01:14:40,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's incredible. It's so gorgeous.</font>

1144
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:44,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you do us the honor?
Please? Please? Please?</font>

1145
01:14:56,345 --> 01:14:58,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1146
01:15:01,475 --> 01:15:02,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my!</font>

1147
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:11,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bird.</font>

1148
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:16,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got feathers.
It's like a bird.</font>

1149
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:17,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a, um...</font>

1150
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:18,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a Mockingjay.</font>

1151
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:22,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time,</font>

1152
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>hasn't he? What theatricality!</i></font>

1153
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:26,042
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Cinna!</i></font>

1154
01:15:27,127 --> 01:15:28,211
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Take a bow.</i></font>

1155
01:15:36,552 --> 01:15:37,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Peeta,</font>

1156
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:42,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">the wedding, the marriage, never to be?</font>

1157
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:45,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, actually, we got married.</font>

1158
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">In secret.</font>

1159
01:15:48,314 --> 01:15:50,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">A secret wedding?</font>

1160
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:51,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Do tell.</font>

1161
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">We... We want our love to be eternal.</font>

1162
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:55,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1163
01:15:55,404 --> 01:15:56,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Katniss and I,</font>

1164
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:58,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've been luckier than most.</font>

1165
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I wouldn't have any regrets at all</font>

1166
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:05,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it weren't...</font>

1167
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:08,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">If...</font>

1168
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:12,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for what? What?</font>

1169
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it weren't for the baby.</font>

1170
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
This is news! Let's find out more.</font>

1171
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:25,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down. This is news to all of us.</font>

1172
01:16:25,894 --> 01:16:26,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call off The Games!</font>

1173
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:28,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1174
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's, uh...
- Stop The Games!</font>

1175
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:35,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, calm down.</font>

1176
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:38,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great night. A great night.</font>

1177
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:45,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is news to all of us.</font>

1178
01:16:47,122 --> 01:16:49,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, all right.</font>

1179
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:52,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to find out
what we do about this.</font>

1180
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:58,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cancel The Games!</font>

1181
01:16:59,469 --> 01:17:01,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop The Games!</font>

1182
01:17:12,106 --> 01:17:14,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way they'll cancel. They can't.</font>

1183
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:20,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby bomb was a stroke of genius.</font>

1184
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, Games are still on.</font>

1185
01:17:24,618 --> 01:17:26,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is goodbye, for now.</font>

1186
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:30,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Presents for the boys.</font>

1187
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:32,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

1188
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:36,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your token. Remember?</font>

1189
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:38,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hair for me. Pin for Katniss.</font>

1190
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gold bangle for you.</font>

1191
01:17:41,094 --> 01:17:44,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for Peeta, the medallion
that we talked about.</font>

1192
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:47,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Effie.</font>

1193
01:17:48,976 --> 01:17:51,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a team. Aren't we?</font>

1194
01:17:54,314 --> 01:17:57,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm so proud of my Victors.</font>

1195
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:00,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">So proud.</font>

1196
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:04,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so...</font>

1197
01:18:08,704 --> 01:18:13,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you both deserved so much better.</font>

1198
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Effie.</font>

1199
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:18,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am truly sorry.</font>

1200
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Haymitch.</font>

1201
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">For everything.</font>

1202
01:18:31,351 --> 01:18:33,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any last advice?</font>

1203
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:36,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay alive.</font>

1204
01:18:38,902 --> 01:18:40,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch, wait.</font>

1205
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:45,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember our deal.</font>

1206
01:18:46,826 --> 01:18:49,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do whatever it takes to keep him alive.</font>

1207
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:51,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me.</font>

1208
01:18:51,872 --> 01:18:52,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1209
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:57,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, when you're in the arena,</font>

1210
01:18:57,712 --> 01:18:59,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">remember who the real enemy is.</font>

1211
01:19:10,182 --> 01:19:12,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be with
anyone else in there.</font>

1212
01:19:13,603 --> 01:19:14,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just you.</font>

1213
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:22,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's what you want.</font>

1214
01:19:24,404 --> 01:19:25,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I want.</font>

1215
01:19:32,121 --> 01:19:33,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you soon.</font>

1216
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:00,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your tracker.</font>

1217
01:20:28,761 --> 01:20:31,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this. They're holding hands.</font>

1218
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:33,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want them dead.</font>

1219
01:20:35,518 --> 01:20:36,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be patient.</font>

1220
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're holding hands now,</font>

1221
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:41,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the minute the gun goes off,
it'll be a bloodbath.</font>

1222
01:20:43,984 --> 01:20:46,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the whole idea
of revolution will be discredited.</font>

1223
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:48,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the idea of her?</font>

1224
01:20:48,823 --> 01:20:51,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">The idea of the Mockingjay?</font>

1225
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:53,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more allies she betrays,</font>

1226
01:20:54,287 --> 01:20:56,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more friends she kills,</font>

1227
01:20:57,457 --> 01:20:58,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more she reveals her true self.</font>

1228
01:20:59,082 --> 01:21:02,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as it ends with
her picture in the sky</font>

1229
01:21:02,045 --> 01:21:03,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the sound of cannon.</font>

1230
01:21:03,462 --> 01:21:04,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it shall.</font>

1231
01:21:04,881 --> 01:21:05,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">It better.</font>

1232
01:21:06,631 --> 01:21:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's watch her get her hands dirty first.</font>

1233
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:10,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1234
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:12,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

1235
01:21:24,775 --> 01:21:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's start.</font>

1236
01:21:31,783 --> 01:21:34,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">This suit is light. No thermal.</font>

1237
01:21:34,327 --> 01:21:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'd guess tropics or desert.</font>

1238
01:21:36,537 --> 01:21:39,623
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sixty seconds to launch.</i></font>

1239
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:43,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">That dress was beautiful.</font>

1240
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:46,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it was the best
one you've ever made.</font>

1241
01:21:47,422 --> 01:21:49,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd like it.</font>

1242
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:51,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to tell
you, because I don't...</font>

1243
01:21:51,344 --> 01:21:52,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

1244
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:56,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, I'm still betting on you,
Girl on Fire.</font>

1245
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:15,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten seconds to launch.</font>

1246
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:40,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1247
01:22:40,475 --> 01:22:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna! No!</font>

1248
01:22:45,564 --> 01:22:47,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

1249
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:49,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Cinna!</font>

1250
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:53,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

1251
01:22:54,865 --> 01:22:55,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1252
01:22:58,368 --> 01:23:01,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no...</font>

1253
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,354
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Let the 75th
Hunger Games begin.</i></font>

1254
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:28,983
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>May the odds be ever in your favor.</i></font>

1255
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:30,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1256
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:37,824
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ten, nine, eight,</i></font>

1257
01:23:38,033 --> 01:23:40,368
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>seven, six,</i></font>

1258
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:43,247
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>five, four,</i></font>

1259
01:23:43,706 --> 01:23:46,292
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>three, two,</i></font>

1260
01:23:46,626 --> 01:23:47,667
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>one.</i></font>

1261
01:24:32,337 --> 01:24:33,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good thing we're allies, right?</font>

1262
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:35,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get that?</font>

1263
01:24:35,882 --> 01:24:36,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think?</font>

1264
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:39,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duck.</font>

1265
01:24:42,931 --> 01:24:44,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't trust 1 and 2.</font>

1266
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take this side. You hold them off.</font>

1267
01:24:46,269 --> 01:24:47,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go find Peeta.</font>

1268
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:53,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, Mags found him. He's over here.</font>

1269
01:25:47,162 --> 01:25:49,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go.</font>

1270
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:10,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, hold up. Hold up.</font>

1271
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:13,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

1272
01:26:13,648 --> 01:26:15,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You all right now?</font>

1273
01:26:17,484 --> 01:26:18,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

1274
01:26:23,448 --> 01:26:24,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it's hot.</font>

1275
01:26:25,408 --> 01:26:26,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta find fresh water.</font>

1276
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:40,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess we're not
holding hands any more.</font>

1277
01:26:41,634 --> 01:26:42,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's funny?</font>

1278
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:46,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time that cannon goes off,
it's music to my ears.</font>

1279
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:48,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about any of them.</font>

1280
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:51,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to hear.</font>

1281
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to face the Career Pack alone?</font>

1282
01:26:55,146 --> 01:26:56,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would Haymitch say?</font>

1283
01:26:56,649 --> 01:26:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch isn't here.</font>

1284
01:26:59,318 --> 01:27:00,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's keep moving.</font>

1285
01:27:44,947 --> 01:27:45,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, no!</font>

1286
01:27:52,454 --> 01:27:53,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1287
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1288
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:58,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not breathing. He's not breathing.</font>

1289
01:27:58,793 --> 01:28:00,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not breathing! Peeta!</font>

1290
01:28:06,676 --> 01:28:07,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1291
01:28:08,345 --> 01:28:09,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1292
01:28:10,305 --> 01:28:11,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Come on!</font>

1293
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:12,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, wake up.</font>

1294
01:28:13,516 --> 01:28:14,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1295
01:28:17,479 --> 01:28:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, wake up.</font>

1296
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:20,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Come on!</font>

1297
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:22,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me in closer.</font>

1298
01:28:27,989 --> 01:28:29,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cannon ready?</font>

1299
01:28:33,412 --> 01:28:36,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta!</font>

1300
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:39,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Peeta. Peeta.</font>

1301
01:28:43,171 --> 01:28:44,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1302
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta? Peeta.</font>

1303
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:54,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1304
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:55,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful. There's a force field up there.</font>

1305
01:28:59,688 --> 01:29:02,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. You were dead.</font>

1306
01:29:03,192 --> 01:29:05,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were dead. Your heart stopped.</font>

1307
01:29:05,944 --> 01:29:07,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

1308
01:29:07,863 --> 01:29:09,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's working now.</font>

1309
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... Do you wanna stand up?</font>

1310
01:29:14,411 --> 01:29:15,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1311
01:29:25,588 --> 01:29:26,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

1312
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:36,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday I want to love someone that much.</font>

1313
01:29:37,225 --> 01:29:41,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so you shall, my darling. So you shall.</font>

1314
01:30:03,252 --> 01:30:04,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

1315
01:31:01,476 --> 01:31:02,810
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The force field...</i></font>

1316
01:31:02,978 --> 01:31:05,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a dome. We're at
the edge of the arena.</font>

1317
01:31:05,564 --> 01:31:07,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't find any signs of fresh water.</font>

1318
01:31:09,318 --> 01:31:10,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna get dark soon.</font>

1319
01:31:11,153 --> 01:31:13,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be safe with our backs protected.
We should set up camp.</font>

1320
01:31:13,697 --> 01:31:16,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take turns sleeping. I
can take first watch.</font>

1321
01:31:16,742 --> 01:31:17,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a chance.</font>

1322
01:31:19,994 --> 01:31:22,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, that thing I did
back there for Peeta?</font>

1323
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:24,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was called "saving his life."</font>

1324
01:31:24,082 --> 01:31:27,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I wanted to kill either of you,
I would've done it by now.</font>

1325
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:34,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take the first watch.</font>

1326
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:38,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just for a little bit.</font>

1327
01:31:55,863 --> 01:31:56,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's Peeta?</font>

1328
01:31:59,451 --> 01:32:02,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's okay, I think.</font>

1329
01:32:02,287 --> 01:32:04,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just dehydrated like the rest of us.</font>

1330
01:32:37,655 --> 01:32:38,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight.</font>

1331
01:32:40,074 --> 01:32:41,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1332
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1333
01:33:00,804 --> 01:33:01,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink up?</font>

1334
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:03,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

1335
01:33:03,515 --> 01:33:04,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from Haymitch.</font>

1336
01:33:07,101 --> 01:33:08,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's a spile.</font>

1337
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:09,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">A What?</font>

1338
01:33:25,328 --> 01:33:27,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.</font>

1339
01:33:28,164 --> 01:33:29,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some water.</font>

1340
01:33:39,467 --> 01:33:40,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get a leaf.</font>

1341
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get some for Mags.</font>

1342
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:49,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go.</font>

1343
01:33:57,319 --> 01:33:58,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want some more?</font>

1344
01:34:30,351 --> 01:34:31,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I counted 12.</font>

1345
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:34,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Midnight?</font>

1346
01:34:35,064 --> 01:34:36,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the number of districts.</font>

1347
01:34:52,707 --> 01:34:54,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

1348
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:58,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're not gonna sleep, I will.</font>

1349
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:00,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1350
01:36:20,045 --> 01:36:23,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run! Run! The fog is poison!</font>

1351
01:36:24,298 --> 01:36:25,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on</font>

1352
01:36:28,136 --> 01:36:29,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

1353
01:37:33,243 --> 01:37:35,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">God! Ah, God!</font>

1354
01:37:37,204 --> 01:37:40,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mags, please, please! Come on! Come on!</font>

1355
01:37:42,543 --> 01:37:43,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

1356
01:37:50,469 --> 01:37:51,636

1357
01:37:52,554 --> 01:37:53,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, please.</font>

1358
01:37:54,264 --> 01:37:56,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, please, stand up. We have to go.</font>

1359
01:37:58,601 --> 01:37:59,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mags?</font>

1360
01:38:00,228 --> 01:38:02,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mags? Mags!
- Finnick.</font>

1361
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:03,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mags!
- Finnick.</font>

1362
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:05,274

1363
01:38:06,484 --> 01:38:07,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick, we have to go.</font>

1364
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:09,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get outta here.</font>

1365
01:38:11,155 --> 01:38:12,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go.</font>

1366
01:38:13,574 --> 01:38:16,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, come on, come on.</font>

1367
01:38:16,744 --> 01:38:17,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1368
01:38:30,966 --> 01:38:32,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1369
01:40:07,605 --> 01:40:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water! The water helps.</font>

1370
01:40:59,407 --> 01:41:00,908

1372
01:41:37,654 --> 01:41:39,447

1373
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:42,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1374
01:42:01,051 --> 01:42:02,052
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What?</i></font>

1375
01:42:26,493 --> 01:42:28,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Peeta.
- Yeah?</font>

1376
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:30,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk over here slowly.</font>

1377
01:42:37,505 --> 01:42:38,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

1378
01:43:03,364 --> 01:43:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to the beach.</font>

1379
01:44:14,685 --> 01:44:16,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get to the beach!</font>

1380
01:44:40,295 --> 01:44:41,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

1381
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:43,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Morphling! Help me get her!</font>

1382
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:10,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.</font>

1383
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:11,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Shh!</font>

1384
01:45:15,162 --> 01:45:19,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you wanna see something?
Look up. Look.</font>

1385
01:45:20,502 --> 01:45:22,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at it. Look at that.</font>

1386
01:45:23,671 --> 01:45:25,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's incredible, isn't it?</font>

1387
01:45:25,756 --> 01:45:27,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">All those colors.</font>

1388
01:45:28,259 --> 01:45:30,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about anything else.</font>

1389
01:45:31,179 --> 01:45:32,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right here with you.</font>

1390
01:45:33,222 --> 01:45:35,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

1391
01:46:34,742 --> 01:46:38,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sacrificed herself for me
and I didn't even know her name.</font>

1392
01:46:40,247 --> 01:46:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think she sacrificed herself?</font>

1393
01:46:44,668 --> 01:46:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looked like it.</font>

1394
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make any sense.</font>

1395
01:47:18,453 --> 01:47:20,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. For you.</font>

1396
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:26,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1397
01:47:34,135 --> 01:47:35,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's new.</font>

1398
01:48:28,564 --> 01:48:30,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's here.</font>

1399
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:40,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna?</font>

1400
01:48:41,536 --> 01:48:42,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna!</font>

1401
01:48:42,869 --> 01:48:43,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1402
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:51,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess we have more allies.</font>

1403
01:49:00,887 --> 01:49:02,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

1404
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got 'em out.</font>

1405
01:49:04,434 --> 01:49:06,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were all the way deep into the jungle</font>

1406
01:49:06,644 --> 01:49:08,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I thought it was gonna be safe.</font>

1407
01:49:09,479 --> 01:49:11,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when the rain started.</font>

1408
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:13,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was water.</font>

1409
01:49:14,109 --> 01:49:15,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">It turned out to be blood.</font>

1410
01:49:16,237 --> 01:49:19,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tick took.
- Hot, thick blood.</font>

1411
01:49:19,239 --> 01:49:20,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was coming down.
- Tick took.</font>

1412
01:49:20,783 --> 01:49:22,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was choking us.</font>

1413
01:49:22,243 --> 01:49:24,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.</font>

1414
01:49:25,162 --> 01:49:26,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick tock.</font>

1415
01:49:26,247 --> 01:49:28,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when Blight hit the force field.</font>

1416
01:49:28,582 --> 01:49:30,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took. Tick took.</font>

1417
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wasn't much, but he was from home.</font>

1418
01:49:33,337 --> 01:49:34,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1419
01:49:36,298 --> 01:49:37,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1420
01:49:38,225 --> 01:49:40,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tick took.
- What's wrong with her?</font>

1421
01:49:40,011 --> 01:49:41,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's in shock.
- Tick took.</font>

1422
01:49:41,636 --> 01:49:44,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dehydration isn't helping.
Do you have fresh water?</font>

1423
01:49:44,765 --> 01:49:45,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can get some.
- Just...</font>

1424
01:49:45,932 --> 01:49:47,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1425
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. Stop it!</font>

1426
01:49:49,479 --> 01:49:51,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey! Lay off her!
- Just sit down!</font>

1427
01:49:51,939 --> 01:49:53,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! What are you doing?</font>

1428
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:56,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, hey, hey!
- I got them out for you!</font>

1429
01:49:56,652 --> 01:49:57,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

1430
01:49:58,112 --> 01:49:59,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go, Finnick!</font>

1431
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:00,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me? What does that mean?</font>

1432
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:01,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go.</font>

1433
01:50:01,615 --> 01:50:03,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You did want them as allies.
- I'm fine.</font>

1434
01:50:08,622 --> 01:50:10,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's get you cleaned up.</font>

1435
01:50:12,877 --> 01:50:13,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1436
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:15,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tick took.
- Tick took!</font>

1437
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:16,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took, okay.</font>

1438
01:50:29,472 --> 01:50:30,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does Beetee have there?</font>

1439
01:50:30,978 --> 01:50:33,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">The coil? It's some kind of wire.</font>

1440
01:50:35,483 --> 01:50:37,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he get it from the Cornucopia?</font>

1441
01:50:38,485 --> 01:50:40,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took a knife in the back to get it.</font>

1442
01:50:41,404 --> 01:50:43,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tick took! Tick took!
- All right.</font>

1443
01:50:43,573 --> 01:50:44,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

1444
01:50:45,033 --> 01:50:46,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... Have fun with "Nuts."</font>

1445
01:50:57,421 --> 01:50:58,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1446
01:50:58,713 --> 01:50:59,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick took.</font>

1447
01:51:01,341 --> 01:51:02,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a clock.</font>

1448
01:51:04,345 --> 01:51:05,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a clock.</font>

1449
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, it's a clock!
Wiress, you're a genius.</font>

1450
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:09,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a genius!</font>

1451
01:51:17,859 --> 01:51:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This entire arena
seems to be laid out like a clock</i></font>

1452
01:51:20,862 --> 01:51:22,404
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>with a new threat every hour,</i></font>

1453
01:51:22,529 --> 01:51:24,573
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but they stay only within their wedge.</i></font>

1454
01:51:24,865 --> 01:51:26,242
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It all starts with the lightning.</i></font>

1455
01:51:26,701 --> 01:51:28,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys.</font>

1456
01:51:28,536 --> 01:51:29,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the first four hours.</font>

1457
01:51:30,037 --> 01:51:32,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">At 10:00, that big wave
hits from over there.</font>

1458
01:51:32,414 --> 01:51:34,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wiress, you're a genius.</font>

1459
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:36,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, the tail points to 12.</font>

1460
01:51:36,711 --> 01:51:38,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where the lightning
strikes at noon and midnight.</font>

1461
01:51:39,087 --> 01:51:40,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strikes where?</font>

1462
01:51:40,381 --> 01:51:41,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">That big tree.</font>

1463
01:51:44,926 --> 01:51:46,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

1464
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:50,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock."</font>

1465
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:52,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The clock struck one, the mouse ran down."</font>

1466
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hickory dickory dock."</font>

1467
01:51:58,274 --> 01:52:00,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So 12:00 to 1:00, lightning.</font>

1468
01:52:00,568 --> 01:52:02,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood.</font>

1469
01:52:02,569 --> 01:52:04,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then fog. And then monkeys.</font>

1470
01:52:05,072 --> 01:52:08,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hickory dickory dock.
The dog barked at the clock."</font>

1471
01:52:08,909 --> 01:52:10,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The clock struck 3:00..."</font>

1472
01:52:10,118 --> 01:52:11,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then 10:00 to 11:00, the wave.</font>

1473
01:52:11,578 --> 01:52:13,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about everything else?
Did you guys see anything?</font>

1474
01:52:13,456 --> 01:52:14,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hickory dickory dock."</font>

1475
01:52:14,582 --> 01:52:16,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing but blood.
- It doesn't matter.</font>

1476
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.</font>

1477
01:52:19,252 --> 01:52:20,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Relatively speaking.</font>

1478
01:52:49,492 --> 01:52:50,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change it up. Spin it.</font>

1479
01:52:59,292 --> 01:53:00,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Come on!</font>

1480
01:53:19,896 --> 01:53:20,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!</font>

1481
01:53:36,579 --> 01:53:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1482
01:53:41,585 --> 01:53:42,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. That's enough.</font>

1483
01:53:44,337 --> 01:53:45,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see how they tell time now.</font>

1484
01:54:09,447 --> 01:54:10,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

1485
01:54:13,367 --> 01:54:17,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just get what we
need and get off the bloody island.</font>

1486
01:54:25,378 --> 01:54:27,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">So besides Brutus and Enobaria, who's left?</font>

1487
01:54:27,965 --> 01:54:29,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Chaff. Just those three.</font>

1488
01:54:29,716 --> 01:54:32,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know they're outnumbered.
I doubt they'll attack again.</font>

1489
01:54:32,302 --> 01:54:33,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're safe here on the beach.</font>

1490
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:35,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we do? We hunt 'em down?</font>

1491
01:54:37,224 --> 01:54:38,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, help me!</font>

1492
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prim!</font>

1493
01:54:40,226 --> 01:54:41,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Prim! Prim!
- No!</font>

1494
01:54:42,145 --> 01:54:43,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss! Katniss, wait!</font>

1495

01:55:04,918 --> 01:55:06,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

1502
01:55:06,002 --> 01:55:07,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1503
01:55:07,421 --> 01:55:08,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1504
01:55:08,506 --> 01:55:09,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! It's not her.

1506
01:55:12,009 --> 01:55:15,095

- Finnick! It's not her.</font>

1507
01:55:15,215 --> 01:55:16,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a jabberjay. It's not her.</font>

1508
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:17,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how do you think they got that sound?</font>

1509
01:55:17,972 --> 01:55:19,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jabberjays copy.</font>

1510

<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss!</font>

1511
01:55:20,475 --> 01:55:21,476

1512
01:55:25,105 --> 01:55:26,689

01:55:46,961 --> 01:55:49,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, stop, stop! It's okay!</font>

1515
01:55:51,548 --> 01:55:53,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay! They're just mutts!
It's not real!</font>

1516
01:56:05,854 --> 01:56:07,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over. It's okay. They're gone.</font>

1517
01:56:07,814 --> 01:56:09,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hour's gone. The hour's up.
It's all right.</font>

1518
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Prim! Find Prim!
- No, no. Prim's okay.</font>

1520
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

1521
01:56:16,698 --> 01:56:19,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? They won't touch Prim. All right?</font>

1522
01:56:21,412 --> 01:56:24,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your fiancé's right.
The whole country loves your sister.</font>

1527
01:56:37,552 --> 01:56:41,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we...
What if we set your backyard on fire?</font>

1528
01:56:42,015 --> 01:56:45,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you can't put everybody in here.</font>

1529
01:56:51,192 --> 01:56:52,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1530
01:56:53,735 --> 01:56:55,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't hurt me.</font>

1531
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:57,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one left that I love.</font>

1532
01:57:01,534 --> 01:57:03,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you some water.</font>

1533
01:57:29,813 --> 01:57:30,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1534
01:57:42,993 --> 01:57:44,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Annie?</font>

1535
01:57:48,748 --> 01:57:51,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie Cresta. The girl
Mags volunteered for.</font>

1536
01:57:53,337 --> 01:57:57,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won, like, four years...
Five years ago.</font>

1537
01:57:58,676 --> 01:58:00,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she the one that went a little...</font>

1538
01:58:01,427 --> 01:58:02,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1539
01:58:10,979 --> 01:58:12,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love is weird.</font>

1540
01:58:17,278 --> 01:58:19,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a plan.</font>

1541
01:58:22,783 --> 01:58:24,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick!</font>

1542
01:58:24,534 --> 01:58:26,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a plan.</font>

1543
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:32,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?</font>

1544
01:58:32,667 --> 01:58:34,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The jungle's a nightmare.</font>

1545
01:58:34,627 --> 01:58:36,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably here on the beach.</font>

1546
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:37,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are they not here?</font>

1547
01:58:37,797 --> 01:58:39,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we are. We claimed it.</font>

1548
01:58:40,009 --> 01:58:41,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we left, they would come.</font>

1549
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:43,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or stay hidden in the tree line.</font>

1550
01:58:43,804 --> 01:58:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which in just over four hours</font>

1551
01:58:45,639 --> 01:58:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be soaked with water
from the 10:00 wave.</font>

1552
01:58:48,475 --> 01:58:49,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what happens at midnight?</font>

1553
01:58:49,726 --> 01:58:51,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lightning strikes that tree.</font>

1554
01:58:51,145 --> 01:58:52,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's what I propose.</font>

1555
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.</font>

1556
01:58:56,317 --> 01:58:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should draw them back to the beach.</font>

1557
01:58:58,152 --> 01:59:01,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.</font>

1558
01:59:02,989 --> 01:59:05,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone in the water or on the damp sand</font>

1559
01:59:05,533 --> 01:59:06,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be electrocuted.</font>

1560
01:59:08,996 --> 01:59:11,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?</font>

1561
01:59:11,372 --> 01:59:13,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I invented it.</font>

1562
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:15,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you, it won't burn up.</font>

1563
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:28,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's better than hunting them down.</font>

1564
01:59:28,765 --> 01:59:29,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, why not?</font>

1565
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it fails, no harm done anyway, right?</font>

1566
01:59:33,686 --> 01:59:35,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I say we try it.</font>

1567
01:59:36,023 --> 01:59:38,024
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So what can we do to help?</i></font>

1568
01:59:39,693 --> 01:59:41,528
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Keep me alive for the next six hours.</i></font>

1569
01:59:41,862 --> 01:59:44,155
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That would be extremely helpful.</i></font>

1570
01:59:57,711 --> 01:59:59,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we need to go.</font>

1571
01:59:59,712 --> 02:00:01,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">This plan's gonna work.</font>

1572
02:00:01,881 --> 02:00:03,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so, too.</font>

1573
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:07,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.</font>

1574
02:00:07,261 --> 02:00:09,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.</font>

1575
02:00:09,555 --> 02:00:11,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they don't either?</font>

1576
02:00:11,934 --> 02:00:13,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if all of us refuse to shoot first?</font>

1577
02:00:14,269 --> 02:00:16,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might still end up dead.</font>

1578
02:00:17,398 --> 02:00:20,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not. I mean, it
worked for us last time.</font>

1579
02:00:20,567 --> 02:00:22,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not gonna make
that same mistake again.</font>

1580
02:00:22,778 --> 02:00:25,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know and I know that there's only one
person walking out of here.</font>

1581
02:00:25,905 --> 02:00:27,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's gonna be one of us.</font>

1582
02:00:30,661 --> 02:00:32,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Careers are still out there.</font>

1583
02:00:33,788 --> 02:00:36,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should stick with these
guys till midnight.</font>

1584
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:39,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we hear a cannon, we go.</font>

1585
02:00:52,349 --> 02:00:54,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, I don't...</font>

1586
02:00:54,145 --> 02:00:56,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitch</font>

1587
02:00:56,185 --> 02:00:58,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he made me promises, too.</font>

1588
02:01:08,282 --> 02:01:09,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you die</font>

1589
02:01:10,826 --> 02:01:12,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I live</font>

1590
02:01:15,122 --> 02:01:16,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have nothing.</font>

1591
02:01:18,207 --> 02:01:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody else that I care about.</font>

1592
02:01:20,627 --> 02:01:21,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

1593
02:01:22,045 --> 02:01:23,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's different for you.</font>

1594
02:01:23,505 --> 02:01:25,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your family needs you.</font>

1595
02:01:34,224 --> 02:01:35,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to live.</font>

1596
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:37,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">For them.</font>

1597
02:01:47,529 --> 02:01:48,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

1598
02:01:51,492 --> 02:01:52,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody needs me.</font>

1599
02:01:56,037 --> 02:01:57,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

1600
02:01:58,498 --> 02:01:59,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you.</font>

1601
02:02:24,233 --> 02:02:26,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, lovebirds!</font>

1602
02:02:32,073 --> 02:02:34,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is preparing to fight.</font>

1603
02:02:34,451 --> 02:02:35,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's our girl.</font>

1604
02:02:40,248 --> 02:02:42,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what you predicted.</font>

1605
02:02:49,382 --> 02:02:51,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moves and countermoves.</font>

1606
02:02:52,552 --> 02:02:53,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed.</font>

1607
02:02:58,559 --> 02:02:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll toast when it's done?</font>

1608
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:05,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, make yourself comfortable.</font>

1609
02:04:12,506 --> 02:04:14,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minimal charring.</font>

1610
02:04:14,467 --> 02:04:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an impressive conductor.</font>

1611
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:17,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get started.</font>

1612
02:04:21,182 --> 02:04:22,643
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Typically a lightning strike</i></font>

1613
02:04:22,768 --> 02:04:25,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">contains five billion joules of energy.</font>

1614
02:04:26,438 --> 02:04:28,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.</font>

1615
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:32,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two girls, go together now.</font>

1616
02:04:32,653 --> 02:04:35,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this. Unspool it carefully.</font>

1617
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:37,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?</font>

1618
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:39,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector.</font>

1619
02:04:39,158 --> 02:04:40,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll meet you there.</font>

1620
02:04:40,827 --> 02:04:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go with them as a guard.</font>

1621
02:04:42,662 --> 02:04:44,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. You're staying
here to protect me.</font>

1622
02:04:45,666 --> 02:04:47,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the tree.</font>

1623
02:04:47,208 --> 02:04:48,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I need to go with her.</font>

1624
02:04:48,835 --> 02:04:52,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are two Careers out there.
I need two guards.</font>

1625
02:04:52,463 --> 02:04:54,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.</font>

1626
02:04:54,548 --> 02:04:56,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't Finnick and Johanna stay with you</font>

1627
02:04:56,051 --> 02:04:57,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Peeta and I'll take the coil?</font>

1628
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all agreed to keep me
alive till midnight, correct?</font>

1629
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:04,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his plan. We all agreed to it.</font>

1630
02:05:04,518 --> 02:05:06,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem here?</font>

1631
02:05:06,478 --> 02:05:08,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent question.</font>

1632
02:05:10,064 --> 02:05:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. There's no problem.</font>

1633
02:05:19,658 --> 02:05:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you at midnight.</font>

1634
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:24,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go!</font>

1635
02:05:53,108 --> 02:05:54,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1636
02:05:54,525 --> 02:05:58,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible.</font>

1637
02:05:58,572 --> 02:06:00,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frying is not how I want to go.</font>

1638
02:06:01,867 --> 02:06:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something...</font>

1639
02:06:21,136 --> 02:06:23,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down.</font>

1640
02:06:30,436 --> 02:06:31,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1641
02:06:50,623 --> 02:06:52,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna, where are you?</font>

1642
02:07:04,095 --> 02:07:05,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna?</font>

1643
02:07:09,935 --> 02:07:10,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

1644
02:07:25,574 --> 02:07:26,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta.</font>

1645
02:07:31,456 --> 02:07:32,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1646
02:07:40,297 --> 02:07:42,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beetee. Beetee!</font>

1647
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta!</font>

1648
02:08:01,194 --> 02:08:02,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta!</font>

1649
02:08:17,210 --> 02:08:18,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, where are you?</font>

1650
02:08:27,386 --> 02:08:29,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it fly, Miss Everdeen.</font>

1651
02:08:29,555 --> 02:08:32,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let it fly.</font>

1652
02:08:42,068 --> 02:08:43,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss.</font>

1653
02:08:47,532 --> 02:08:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember who the real enemy is.</font>

1654
02:09:28,198 --> 02:09:29,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, get away from that tree!</font>

1655
02:09:36,288 --> 02:09:37,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, get away from that tree!</font>

1656
02:09:57,978 --> 02:09:59,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not possible.</font>

1657
02:10:03,149 --> 02:10:04,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavensbee!</font>

1658
02:10:08,279 --> 02:10:10,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch Heavensbee!</font>

1659
02:10:15,953 --> 02:10:18,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, we've lost power.</font>

1660
02:12:45,103 --> 02:12:48,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gonna lose it
when she finds out about the boy.</font>

1661
02:12:48,355 --> 02:12:50,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll still cooperate, though?</font>

1662
02:12:50,649 --> 02:12:52,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without Peeta?
There's no guarantee.</font>

1663
02:12:52,944 --> 02:12:55,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell her win...</font>

1664
02:12:59,868 --> 02:13:01,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, sweetheart.</font>

1665
02:13:07,167 --> 02:13:09,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing with them?</font>

1666
02:13:09,836 --> 02:13:12,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and a syringe against The Capitol?</font>

1667
02:13:12,796 --> 02:13:14,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, this is why no one
lets you make the plans.</font>

1668
02:13:15,507 --> 02:13:17,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell are you doing in here?</font>

1669
02:13:17,176 --> 02:13:19,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Stop. Just listen.</font>

1670
02:13:19,636 --> 02:13:23,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't tell you with Snow watching.
It was too risky.</font>

1671
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:25,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better for you to know nothing.</font>

1672
02:13:27,353 --> 02:13:28,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Peeta?</font>

1673
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Katniss...</font>

1674
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:31,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been our mission
from the beginning.</font>

1675
02:13:32,192 --> 02:13:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plan was always to get you out.</font>

1676
02:13:34,485 --> 02:13:36,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the Tributes were in on it.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">In The Capitol.</font>

You're a liar.</font>

02:14:35,421 --> 02:14:36,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Catnip.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale?</font>

1696
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:55,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Prim?</font>

1697
02:14:56,149 --> 02:14:57,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's alive.</font>

1698
02:14:58,610 --> 02:15:01,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is your mother. I got 'em out in time.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">they sent in hovercrafts.</font>

1702
02:15:11,332 --> 02:15:13,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they started dropping firebombs.</font>

1703
02:15:18,131 --> 02:15:19,591
