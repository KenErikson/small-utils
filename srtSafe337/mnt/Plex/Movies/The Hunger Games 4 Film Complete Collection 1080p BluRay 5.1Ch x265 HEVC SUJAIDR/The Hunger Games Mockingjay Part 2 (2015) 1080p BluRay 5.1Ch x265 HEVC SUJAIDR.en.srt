1
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

2
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.</font>

3
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's a little tender.</font>

4
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

5
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's try your voice now.</font>

6
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My name is Katniss Everdeen.
I'm from District 12."</font>

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My...
- Okay, take your time.</font>

8
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.</font>

9
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">My...</font>

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">name is...</font>

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss Everdeen.</font>

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want...</font>

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to talk to him.</font>

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs time.</font>

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, um, we're trying
somethin' new today.</font>

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been calmer
with the doctors,</font>

17
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they're strangers to him.</font>

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're gonna
test his response</font>

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">on someone
he remembers from home.</font>

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone he trusts.</font>

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send her in.</font>

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

23
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prim.</font>

24
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you feelin'?</font>

25
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's too close.
- Mmm, it's okay.</font>

26
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How'd you get here?
- We live in District 13 now.</font>

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a real place.
Stories are true.</font>

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were rescued.</font>

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">My family hasn't come
to see me.</font>

30
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was an attack on 12.</font>

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

32
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">My family?</font>

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bakery didn't survive.</font>

34
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Katniss.</font>

35
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's because of Katniss.
- Wasn't because of her.</font>

36
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She tell you to say that?
- She didn't tell me anything.</font>

37
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a liar, Prim.
It's a trick.</font>

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta, what you're saying
isn't real.</font>

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">She sent you here
to talk to me.</font>

40
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She knows you're here now.
- It's okay.</font>

41
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows...
You can't trust her!</font>

42
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a monster!</font>

43
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a mutt that The Capitol
created to destroy us!</font>

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get her outta there.
- Do you understand me?</font>

45
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to kill her, Prim!
You have to kill her!</font>

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Katniss?
- She's a mutt!</font>

47
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just
a conditioned response.</font>

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill her!
- It's not him.</font>

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a monster! She's a mutt!</font>

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it's not him.
- She's a mutt!</font>

51
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not enough
manpower coming in from 4.</font>

52
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that's a problem.</font>

53
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, come in.</font>

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">With any kind
of manpower, if we...</font>

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you excuse us
for just a moment?</font>

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a seat.</font>

58
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're feeling better.</font>

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow has to pay
for what he's done.</font>

60
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna help the rebels
in any way I can.</font>

61
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to see
Peeta this way.</font>

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not Peeta.</font>

63
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send me to The Capitol.
I'll do anything.</font>

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't...</font>

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't send you there.</font>

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't get into The Capitol
until we control District 2.</font>

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then send me to 2.</font>

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to
fire up our troops?</font>

69
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call out to the loyalists?
You've seen what I can do.</font>

70
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I have.</font>

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Peeta... before we left.</font>

72
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did you think?</font>

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something selfish.</font>

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore.</font>

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

76
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.</font>

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never let him go.</font>

78
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's goin' on
in your head?</font>

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

80
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like kissing someone
who's drunk.</font>

81
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't count.</font>

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,608
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thirty minutes until touchdown.</i></font>

83
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,886
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Prepare for landing.</i></font>

84
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrap it up.
Cut the chatter. Let's go.</font>

85
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is another version
of booby-trapping a resource.</font>

86
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, I see.
- This one's designed to blind.</font>

87
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoke clings to the eyes.</font>

88
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an application
of the hummingbird trap.</font>

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You scare people
so they flee in this direction</font>

90
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">into what they think
is a safe haven.</font>

91
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two-tiered explosion.</font>

92
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">You allow people enough time
to rush in, help the wounded, then...</font>

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A second bomb.
- Right.</font>

94
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second one goes off here.</font>

95
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess there are
no rules anymore about</font>

96
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">what a person can do
to another person.</font>

97
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think Snow used any
rulebook when he hijacked Peeta.</font>

98
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to District 2.
I'm Corporal Homes.</font>

99
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You follow me, please.</font>

100
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

101
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just how the loyalists
say "Good morning."</font>

102
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Coin,
we're indebted to you</font>

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the reinforcements
and the Mockingjay.</font>

104
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not sure that
anyone outside of 2</font>

105
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">knows what
we've been up against.</font>

106
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is The Nut.</font>

107
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Capitol's headquarters
for all offensive operations.</font>

108
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's manned by both military</font>

109
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">and civilian personnel
from District 2.</font>

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see,</font>

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fortress lies so far beneath
the bedrock, it's untouchable.</font>

112
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday, we attempted
to take the northeastern gate.</font>

113
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">The enemy countered from higher up
and we were forced to pull back.</font>

114
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took heavy losses.</font>

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could we create a decoy?
Send troops towards one gate,</font>

116
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">launch a staggered attack
on another.</font>

117
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose troops do you propose
as a decoy, commander?</font>

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,527
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We have the Mockingjay.
Don't underestimate her.</i></font>

119
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,687
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We could use her
to erode support.</i></font>

120
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She may be able to sway
some of the loyalists.</i></font>

121
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been underground
a long time, Madam Coin.</font>

122
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't like
the rest of Panem.</font>

123
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Support for The Capitol
runs deep here.</font>

124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,559
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then there is
no sacrifice too great.</i></font>

125
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,686
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We need to control the arsenal
inside that fortress.</i></font>

126
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Even with every district
in this alliance,</i></font>

127
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,684
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>we are outgunned.</i></font>

128
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't commit my people
to a ground assault</font>

129
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">just to pillage weapons.</font>

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,842
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Commander Paylor,
your people have suffered</i></font>

131
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,167
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>more than just about anyone else
at the hands of The Capitol.</i></font>

132
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.</font>

133
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,571
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If we don't take District 2,
we won't get into The Capitol.</i></font>

134
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it be enough to disable
the fortress... instead of taking it?</font>

135
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you
have in mind?</font>

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think of it
like a wolf den.</font>

137
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna fight your way in,
so you've got two choices.</font>

138
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trap the wolves inside,
or you flush 'em out.</font>

139
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can't attack
straight on,</font>

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">then couldn't we use
our hovercraft</font>

141
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">to strike around it?
We'll use the mountains.</font>

142
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll hit weak spots
in the peaks.</font>

143
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could design the bomb targets
in sequence using seismic data.</font>

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trigger avalanches.</font>

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Block all exits,
cut off their supplies.</font>

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make it impossible for them
to launch their hovercraft.</font>

147
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bury them alive.</font>

148
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,081
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We'd forfeit any chance
to control the weapons.</i></font>

149
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but we'd face
a weakened Capitol.</font>

150
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's civilians in there.</font>

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should be given
a chance to surrender.</font>

152
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees.</font>

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a luxury we weren't given
when they firebombed 12.</font>

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gotta be a better way.</font>

155
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,963
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I suggest we try the avalanche,
but leave the train tunnel alone.</i></font>

156
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,962
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Civilians can escape
into the square,</i></font>

157
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>where our armies will be
waiting for their surrender.</i></font>

158
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have every
available medic standing by.</font>

159
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they won't surrender?</font>

160
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,006
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then we will need a compelling
voice to persuade them.</i></font>

161
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,561
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Red flag, this is blue leader.</i></font>

162
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,165
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Form up on Charlie Tango,
1,500 meters out.</i></font>

163
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,811
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All bombers are outbound.</i></font>

164
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the difference, Katniss?</font>

165
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crushing the enemy in a mine</font>

166
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">or blowin' them outta the sky
with one of Beetee's arrows.</font>

167
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same thing.</font>

168
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were under attack
in District 8.</font>

169
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.</font>

170
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter.</font>

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if those civilians
are just moppin' floors,</font>

172
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're helping the enemy.</font>

173
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they have to die,
I can live with that.</font>

174
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one who supports
The Capitol is innocent.</font>

175
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">With that kinda thinking,
you can kill whoever you want.</font>

176
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can send kids off
to The Hunger Games</font>

177
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keep the districts in line.</font>

178
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's war, Katniss.</font>

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes killing
isn't personal.</font>

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figured if anyone knew that,
it was you.</font>

181
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, of all people, know
that it's always personal.</font>

182
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, Katniss,
there'll be survivors.</font>

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's focus on
what it is you gotta say.</font>

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Plutarch wrote
a speech for you...</font>

185
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not saying that.</font>

186
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Didn't think so.
Let's, uh...</font>

187
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just remember,
you're talking to everybody.</font>

188
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just the rebels,
but The Capitol,</font>

189
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">the survivors in 2.</font>

190
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want them
to lay down their arms.</font>

191
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you might wanna experiment</font>

192
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a little
sensitivity, warmth.</font>

193
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it quick,
you're exposed.</font>

194
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Katniss Everdeen,</font>

195
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">speaking to all of the loyalists
from the heart of District 2.</font>

196
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Survivors! Inbound!</font>

197
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready! Ready! Guns up!</font>

198
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ready. Guns up!</font>

199
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get you back.</font>

200
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come!</font>

201
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weapons tight!
Weapons tight!</font>

202
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, stand by!</font>

203
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ground!</font>

204
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your weapons down.</font>

205
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on the ground!</font>

206
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your weapons down now!</font>

207
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weapons down!</font>

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! Put it down!</font>

209
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it...</font>

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put your weapons down!
- Drop it!</font>

211
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapon!
You! Drop it.</font>

212
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the gun!</font>

213
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drop it!</font>

214
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold your fire!
- Stop!</font>

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

216
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold your fire!
- Stop!</font>

217
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold your fire!
- He needs help!</font>

218
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your fire!</font>

219
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it!</font>

220
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me one reason
I shouldn't shoot you.</font>

221
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the gun!</font>

222
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

223
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that's the problem,
isn't it?</font>

224
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">We blew up your mine.</font>

225
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">You burned
my district to the ground.</font>

226
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.</font>

227
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you wanna kill me, do it.</font>

228
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make Snow happy.</font>

229
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm tired of killing
his slaves for him.</font>

230
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not his slave.</font>

231
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

232
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Why I killed Cato.</font>

233
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he killed Thresh.</font>

234
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Thresh killed Clove.</font>

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just goes
around and around.</font>

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who wins?</font>

237
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always Snow.</font>

238
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am done being
a piece in his game.</font>

239
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">District 12, District 2.
We have no fight.</font>

240
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except the one The Capitol gave us.</font>

241
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you fighting the rebels?</font>

242
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're neighbors.</font>

243
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're family.</font>

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people
are not your enemy.</font>

245
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have one enemy.</font>

246
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's Snow.</font>

247
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">He corrupts everyone
and everything.</font>

248
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">He turns the best of us
against each other.</font>

249
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop killing for him.</font>

250
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, turn your weapons
to The Capitol.</font>

251
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn your weapons to Snow.</font>

252
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:54,529
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tonight, turn your
weapons to The Capitol.</i></font>

253
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,162
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Turn your weapons to Snow.</i></font>

254
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,326
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hold your fire.</i></font>

255
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">A toast.</font>

256
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Antonius, with our best troops
crushed in the mountains</font>

257
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the rebels
marching on us as we speak,</font>

258
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">what did we celebrate?</font>

259
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">The death of
the Mockingjay, sir.</font>

260
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.</font>

261
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

262
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the same facile thinking</font>

263
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">that led you to divert our best
Peacekeepers into District 2.</font>

264
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a habit of burying
people before they're dead.</font>

265
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Mockingjay were gone,</font>

266
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rebels would already be
using her as a martyr.</font>

267
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Minister Antonius,</font>

268
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid that is not
what we were toasting at all.</font>

269
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, the rebels
can be held off out...</font>

270
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rebels will reach
the outskirts of The Capitol</font>

271
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a matter of days.</font>

272
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll evacuate the outer
blocks to let them in.</font>

273
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want all anti-aircraft
defenses ready,</font>

274
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we're secure
from the skies.</font>

275
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lure them into the city,</font>

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then our Gamemakers</font>

277
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">will make them pay
for every inch with blood.</font>

278
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want every camera watching.</font>

279
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll turn their advance into
a celebration of suffering.</font>

280
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.</font>

281
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what did we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?</font>

282
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">We toasted a glorious era...</font>

283
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming to its bitter end.</font>

284
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there she is.
The Mockingjay.</font>

285
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that speech you gave.
Oh, man, feel.</font>

286
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I still have goose bumps.</font>

287
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't mind, do you?</font>

288
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cut off my supply of morphling.</font>

289
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's this head doctor that
comes in and sees me every day,</font>

290
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to help me adjust to reality.</font>

291
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like some guy from this rabbit's warren</font>

292
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually knows anything
about my reality.</font>

293
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least 20 times in a session,
he tells me that I'm totally safe.</font>

294
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Safe from The Capitol.</font>

295
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Safe from Snow.</font>

296
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?</font>

297
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Till I got shot.
- Oh, please.</font>

298
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bullet didn't
even touch you.</font>

299
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna saw to that. Of course,
your costume would be bulletproof.</font>

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what are your injuries?</font>

301
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruised ribs, bruised lung.</font>

302
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.</font>

303
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I've got two.
Do you want one of mine?</font>

304
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.</font>

305
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that why you hate me?
- Partly.</font>

306
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're also a little
hard to swallow.</font>

307
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole tacky romance drama</font>

308
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the "defender
of the hopeless" act.</font>

309
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though it's not an act.</font>

310
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which makes it
even more unbearable.</font>

311
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel free to take
any of this personally.</font>

312
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have
been the Mockingjay.</font>

313
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody else would
tell you what to say.</font>

314
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">But nobody likes me.</font>

315
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're afraid of you.
- Maybe here,</font>

316
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">but... in The Capitol,
you're the only thing</font>

317
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they're scared of.</font>

318
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just stuff
my family brought.</font>

319
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from Peeta.</font>

320
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

321
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?</font>

322
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">We showed him
footage of your speech in 2.</font>

323
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had real memories of you.</font>

324
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">That still doesn't mean
I'm going in there.</font>

325
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's strapped down.
He can't hurt you.</font>

326
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. This is different. Haymitch,
I really don't want to.</font>

327
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter what you want.
It's for Peeta.</font>

328
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the harm in trying?</font>

329
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched you die.</font>

330
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You look terrible.
- You've looked better.</font>

331
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not even remotely nice
to say that to me now.</font>

332
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never the nice one.
You were.</font>

333
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I saw you die,
I remembered something.</font>

334
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">About the bread.</font>

335
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember... you in the rain.</font>

336
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I burned it on purpose.</font>

337
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">To give it to you.</font>

338
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember
my mother hitting me.</font>

339
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed
to give it to the pig.</font>

340
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the first
we'd eaten in days.</font>

341
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I take
a beating like that for you?</font>

342
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:09,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you were kind
and generous.</font>

343
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you love me?</font>

344
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said that's why Snow
tortured you. To hurt me.</font>

345
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snow says that everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.</font>

346
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that
I would have</font>

347
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">saved myself
a lot of suffering,</font>

348
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I'd just given
that bread to the pig.</font>

349
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the only thing left
to say is "thank you."</font>

350
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be in The Capitol.</font>

351
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you have done your job.</font>

352
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been very successful
as the Mockingjay.</font>

353
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've unified the districts.
And now we want you to rest.</font>

354
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to heal.</font>

355
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last the rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.</font>

356
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.</font>

357
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll shoot more propos
right here in 13,</font>

358
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">showing them
that you're alive.</font>

359
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be with the troops.</font>

360
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be like being
on the front lines.</font>

361
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as the soldiers know,</font>

362
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">you survived
a bullet to the heart.</font>

363
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they'll understand
why you're not with them.</font>

364
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we win this war,</font>

365
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll fly you in
for the surrender.</font>

366
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll need you
for the ceremony.</font>

367
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're very valuable to us.</font>

368
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do whatever
you need me to do.</font>

369
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">From this day forth,
in sickness and in health,</font>

370
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">for richer or poorer.</font>

371
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise to love
and cherish you each day.</font>

372
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, Finnick Odair,</font>

373
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">take you, Annie Cresta,
as my wife from this day forth.</font>

374
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together or apart,
we will always be united.</font>

375
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">One life, one purpose,
one destiny.</font>

376
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may kiss the bride.</font>

377
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw Peeta, didn't you?</font>

378
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you tell him "Hi" for me?</font>

379
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're old friends, you know.</font>

380
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had adjoining cells
in The Capitol.</font>

381
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're very familiar
with each other's screams.</font>

382
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill Snow.</font>

383
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing good is safe
while he's alive.</font>

384
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't make
another speech about it.</font>

385
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more cameras.
No more propos.</font>

386
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more Games.</font>

387
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to see my eyes
when I kill him.</font>

388
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're talking.</font>

389
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find a way to The Capitol</font>

390
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">when everybody's looking
the other way.</font>

391
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear the medics talking.</font>

392
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're shipping supplies
for the front line</font>

393
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">from hangar two
around midnight tonight.</font>

394
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Medicine, painkillers.</font>

395
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna go
steal some for myself,</font>

396
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I guess I could just
stay here and cover for you.</font>

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody can kill anybody,
Katniss. Even a president.</font>

398
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just have to be willing
to sacrifice yourself.</font>

399
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

400
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want Snow
to see you dance?</font>

401
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's her.</font>

402
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Katniss Everdeen.</font>

403
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Thought you were
in the hospital.</font>

404
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was.</font>

405
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

406
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What is she doing?</i></font>

407
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, it's so frustrating
when she goes rogue.</font>

408
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't just adolescent,
it's insubordination.</font>

409
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put her on the first
hovercraft back.</font>

410
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be ridiculous.
She can't come back now.</font>

411
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's mythic.</font>

412
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the front lines,
surviving a gunshot wound.</font>

413
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't have staged it
better myself.</font>

414
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. I know.</font>

415
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to stay
where she is.</font>

416
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whatever she's doing,
we conceived it.</font>

417
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was our plan all along.</font>

418
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it was.</font>

419
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Heavensbee,
you're the Gamemaker.</font>

420
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everyone to know,
whatever game she's playing,</font>

421
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's playing for us.</font>

422
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Commander Paylor
of District 8.</font>

423
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a soldier, like all of you,
so here's what I know.</font>

424
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time
in our lifetimes,</font>

425
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're standing together
with 13 districts.</font>

426
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">From what I see here,
we've already made history.</font>

427
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">But history doesn't stop
to celebrate.</font>

428
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're facing an enemy
that will not change</font>

429
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">and will never surrender.</font>

430
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">President Snow has
pulled back Peacekeepers</font>

431
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fortify the center
of the city.</font>

432
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.</font>

433
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">These civilians will be
confused and desperate.</font>

434
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are under orders
not to target them.</font>

435
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.</font>

436
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll show The Capitol people
who we are.</font>

437
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">To slow our advance,
President Snow</font>

438
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">is building
a minefield of traps</font>

439
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">and lethal devices
called "pods."</font>

440
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sadistic inventions
of Gamemakers</font>

441
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">meant to make sport
of our deaths.</font>

442
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">If our armies make it past
Peacekeepers and other defenses,</font>

443
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion,</font>

444
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,608

446

a cause and not a spectacle.</font>

447
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,045

let it be for all of Panem,</font>

448
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let it be forever.</font>

449
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you've already
made history.</font>

450
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the future, our future,
starts tomorrow at dawn,</font>

451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we march together
into The Capitol.</font>

452
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squad 451?</font>

453
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you got
your meals covered.</font>

454

- Don't lie to me.</font>

455
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been hunting together
all our lives.</font>

456
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know when you're gonna
go off on your own.</font>

457
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna leave me behind, too?</font>

458
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">As your fellow soldier,</font>

459
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest that
you stay with your unit.</font>

460
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.</font>

461
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorne, Everdeen,
come meet your new unit.</font>

462
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Lieutenant Jackson,</font>

463
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wanna introduce you
to your squad.</font>

464
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is
Second Lieutenant Mitchell,</font>

465
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,608

467
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is Corporal Homes.</font>

468
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finnick?</font>

469
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.</font>

470
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a short honeymoon.</font>

471
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well,</font>

472
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess we're gonna have to
have one in The Capitol.</font>

473
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After we take it.
- Gather 'round.</font>

474
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squad 451, you're my unit.</font>

475
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lieutenant Jackson is
my second-in-command.</font>

476
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.</font>

477
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are a non-combat unit.</font>

478
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll be following days
behind the front-line troops.</font>

479
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.</font>

you're most effective</font>

482
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- when seen by the masses.
- So we're not gonna fight?</font>

483
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll do whatever
you're ordered to do, soldier.</font>

484
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your job
to ask questions.</font>

485
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

486
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our instructions are
to shoot propaganda footage</font>

487
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the battle-scarred streets
of The Capitol.</font>

488
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were handpicked
to intimidate their forces.</font>

489
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">And inspire surrenders.</font>

490
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though we'll be
working on abandoned streets</font>

491
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">miles behind the front lines,</font>

492
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guarantee you,
wherever they put us,</font>

493
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will not be safe.
This is a war zone.</font>

494
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is likely that we'll
encounter both active pods</font>

495
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Peacekeepers.</font>

496
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're considered high-value
targets to The Capitol.</font>

497
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the event of capture,</font>

498
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll be given
a nightlock pill.</font>

499
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">A poison that
acts immediately.</font>

500
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lieutenant Jackson,
do the honors.</font>

501
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already
briefed you on the pods.</font>

502
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remind you,
they are on every block.</font>

503
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our unit has
been given a Holo.</font>

504
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">A database that contains
a detailed map of The Capitol</font>

505
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a list of every known pod.</font>

506
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">These pods can trigger
anything from bombs</font>

507
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">to traps to mutts.</font>

508
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot move
without this device.</font>

509
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no guarantee
that our database is complete.</font>

510
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">There could be new pods
that we're not aware of.</font>

511
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we don't want
the Gamemakers to know</font>

512
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have this intel,
it has a self-destruct on it.</font>

513
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You flip this switch,
say "nightlock" three times,</font>

514
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it blows itself and anything
within a 10-foot radius.</font>

515
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay within our unit.</font>

516
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even with the Holo,</font>

517
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is likely that new pods
have been set.</font>

518
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.</font>

519
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

520
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">welcome to
the 76th Hunger Games.</font>

521
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never
seen this place so empty.</font>

522
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just keep your eyes open.</font>

523
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a pod.
Let's take cover.</font>

524
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot through
those two buildings.</font>

525
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pollux... right here.</font>

526

527
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,605

530
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

531
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">All clear.</font>

532
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,760
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't think we can
get across this minefield.</i></font>

533
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not without that Holo.</font>

534
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna get it
off him while he's awake.</font>

535
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's make sure we're on
the same watch tonight.</font>

536
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that Peacekeepers?</font>

537
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">451 to base.</font>

538
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,766

from the south. Over.</font>

539
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,409

540
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,166

It's friendly.</font>

547
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackson, cuff him.</font>

548
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soldier, this is
just a precaution</font>

549
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,842

straightened out. Yeah?</font>

550
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,927

552
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,641

on our side now.</font>

553
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll move forward
a few blocks tomorrow</font>

554
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and shoot the new footage.</font>

555
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not in control
of himself.</font>

556
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we schedule an
around-the-clock watch on him.</font>

557

<font color="#FFFFFF">The Leegs till 1700,
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.</font>

558
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a watch.</font>

559
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it really
came down to it,</font>

560
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">you think
you could shoot him?</font>

561
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.</font>

562
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.</font>

563
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure
that kind of a comment</font>

564
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">recommends you for the job,
either, soldier.</font>

565
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put her in the rotation.</font>

566
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna try to kill me.</font>

567
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially with
all this going on.</font>

568
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna set him off.</font>

569
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll keep him contained.</font>

570
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would Coin do this?</font>

571
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's all I know.</font>

572
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.</font>

573
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">She never liked you.</font>

574
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.</font>

575
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she would
put my life in danger?</font>

576
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd deny it, but...</font>

577
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

578
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">One way or another, this war
is gonna come to an end.</font>

579
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">They promised a free election.</font>

580
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe she's startin' to
see you as a threat.</font>

581
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:48,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody would think
I'd be a leader.</font>

582
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'd throw
your support to someone.</font>

583
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it be her?</font>

584
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if your immediate answer
isn't "yes,"</font>

585
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you're dangerous.</font>

586
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't need you
as a rallying cry anymore.</font>

587
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">These propos
can be done without you.</font>

588
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one thing
you could do now</font>

589
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">to add more fire
to this rebellion.</font>

590
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die.</font>

591
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not gonna happen

902
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:25,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

903
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:37,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go!</font>

904
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,649

keep going!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a mutt!
I can't keep control!</font>

909
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:21,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, you can!
- Leave me! I'm a mutt!</font>

910
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,443

911
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with me.</font>

912
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:32,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

913
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

914
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where we are!</font>

915
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a place.
Up those stairs.</font>

916
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep going.</font>

917
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:10,560

shut the door!</font>

919
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:18,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Katniss,
it's okay, it's okay.</font>

920
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

921
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:24,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tigris, do you remember me?</font>

922
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm with Plutarch's
underground.</font>

923
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your help.</font>

924
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear!</font>

925
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you.
You were a stylist in the Games.</font>

926
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until Snow decided I wasn't
pretty enough anymore.</font>

927
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to kill him.</font>

928
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gale's gonna need stitches.</font>

929
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:12,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made it up.</font>

930
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of it.</font>

931
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no special mission
from Coin.</font>

932

<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only my plan.</font>

933
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone that's dead is dead
because of me. I lied.</font>

934
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know. We all knew.</font>

935
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The soldiers from 13?
- They did, too.</font>

936
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:36,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really believe
that Jackson thought</font>

937
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">you had orders from Coin?</font>

938
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">She trusted Boggs and he clearly
wanted you to go on.</font>

939
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never meant
for this to happen.</font>

940
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed. I...</font>

941
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:58,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed them.
I killed Finnick.</font>

942
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Pollux.</font>

943
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,284

946
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:23,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do all those deaths mean?</font>

947
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">They mean that our lives
were never ours.</font>

948
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was no real life</font>

949
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">because we didn't
have any choice.</font>

950
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,689

Katniss...</font>

01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">all those deaths,
they mean something.</font>

954
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:01,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cinna, Boggs, Castor,</font>

955
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackson, Finnick.</font>

956
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:09,565

958
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should keep these clean.</font>

959
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:23,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise they'll get infected.</font>

960
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:28,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should cuff me.</font>

961
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not safe with me yet.</font>

962
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have moments

963
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:38,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my memories
are getting better, but...</font>

964
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:42,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">other times it's like
I'm sleepwalking.</font>

965
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should cuff me.</font>

966
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

967
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">No problem.</font>

968
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep.</font>

969
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:25,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I haven't slept
in days, either.</font>

970
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've volunteered to take
your place in the first Games.</font>

971
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you couldn't have.</font>

972
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she never
would have forgiven you.</font>

973
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:44,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needed you to be there</font>

974
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">and take care
of her family and you did.</font>

975
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't lose you.</font>

976
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">She really loves you.</font>

977
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.</font>

978
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:02,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">She never kissed me like that.</font>

979
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:03,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just part of the show.</font>

980
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, you won her over.</font>

981
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:09,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave up
everything for her.</font>

982
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not gonna be
an issue much longer.</font>

983

are gonna make it out of this.</font>

984
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we do, then...</font>

985
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:26,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's her problem
who to choose, right?</font>

986
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

987
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:30,083

survive without.</font>

1149

01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:35,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">The remaining Victors.
Won't you join us?</font>

1190
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:50,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have invited you all here
for several reasons,</font>

1191
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">but first,
I have an announcement.</font>

1192
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:56,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have taken the burden
and the honor</font>

1193
01:45:56,399 --> 01:45:59,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">of declaring myself
Interim President of Panem.</font>

1194
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:06,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interim? Exactly how long
is that interim?</font>

1195
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no way
of knowing for certain.</font>

1196
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's clear that people
are far too emotional right now</font>

1197
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make a rational decision.</font>

1198
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll plan an election
when the time is right.</font>

1199
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:22,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have called you here
for a far more important vote.</font>

1200
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:25,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">A symbolic vote.</font>

1201
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:28,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">This afternoon,
we will execute Snow.</font>

1202
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:32,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.</font>

1203
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:37,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capitol officials, Peacekeepers,
torturers, Gamemakers.</font>

1204
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the danger is,
once we begin,</font>

1205
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.</font>

1206
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirst for blood is
a difficult urge to satisfy.</font>

1207
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I offer
an alternative plan.</font>

1208
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.</font>

1209
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">The proposal is this.</font>

1210
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:03,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">In lieu of these
barbaric executions,</font>

1211
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">we hold
a symbolic Hunger Games.</font>

1212
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:20,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna have
another Hunger Games</font>

1213
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">with The Capitol's children?</font>

1214
01:47:24,119 --> 01:47:27,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.</font>

1215
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this Plutarch's idea?</font>

1216
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was mine.</font>

1217
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It balances the need
for revenge</font>

1218
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:39,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the least loss
of human life.</font>

1219
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,802
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- You may cast your votes.
- No.</i></font>

1220
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, obviously not.
This is crazy.</font>

1221
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:48,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.</font>

1222
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say "yes."</font>

1223
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do I.
Let them have a taste of it.</font>

1224
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys,
this way of thinking</font>

1225
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:55,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">is what started
these uprisings.</font>

1226
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I vote "no." With Peeta.</font>

1227
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:00,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">So would Finnick,
if he were here.</font>

1228
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, he's not.</i></font>

1229
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because Snow killed him.
- No.</font>

1230
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.</font>

1231
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's down to Katniss
and Haymitch.</font>

1232
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:21,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get to kill Snow.</font>

1233
01:48:22,039 --> 01:48:24,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expected no less of you.</font>

1234
01:48:30,279 --> 01:48:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I vote "yes."</font>

1235
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Prim.</font>

1236
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:39,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haymitch?</font>

1237
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm with the Mockingjay.</font>

1238
01:48:54,439 --> 01:48:55,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">That carries the vote.</font>

1239
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

1240
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll announce the Games tonight,
after the execution.</font>

1241
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's bound to be
quite the show.</font>

1242
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:15,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you look lovely as ever.</font>

1243
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just beautiful.</font>

1244
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finishing touches.</font>

1245
01:50:46,359 --> 01:50:49,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the new Panem.</font>

1246
01:50:51,079 --> 01:50:54,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, on the
Avenue of the Tributes,</font>

1247
01:50:55,079 --> 01:50:59,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of Panem, a free Panem,</font>

1248
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">will watch more than
a mere spectacle.</font>

1249
01:51:04,119 --> 01:51:07,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are gathered to witness</font>

1250
01:51:07,239 --> 01:51:10,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">an historic moment of justice.</font>

1251
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, the greatest friend
to the revolution</font>

1252
01:51:15,319 --> 01:51:19,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">will fire the shot
to end all wars.</font>

1253
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">May her arrow
signify the end of tyranny</font>

1254
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the beginning
of a new era.</font>

1255
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:33,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mockingjay,</font>

1256
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">May your aim be as true</font>

1257
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:42,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">as your heart is pure.</font>

1258
01:52:31,239 --> 01:52:32,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1259
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:34,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1260
01:52:34,359 --> 01:52:36,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

1261
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him! Kill him now!</font>

1262
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

1263
01:53:59,239 --> 01:54:01,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll say this for you, Katniss.</font>

1264
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:04,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't disappoint.</font>

1265
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Plutarch
gave me a letter for you.</font>

1266
01:54:10,119 --> 01:54:11,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want it.</font>

1267
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never make it easy, do you?</font>

1268
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:18,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I'll read it for you.</font>

1269
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:24,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,</font>

1270
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:26,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">but once again, I was not.</font>

1271
01:54:26,279 --> 01:54:30,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were exactly
who I believed you were.</font>

1272
01:54:30,119 --> 01:54:32,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could give you
a proper goodbye.</font>

1273
01:54:32,119 --> 01:54:33,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with both Coin
and Snow dead,</font>

1274
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:36,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fate of the country
will be decided tonight,</font>

1275
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't be seen
at your side.</font>

1276
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:43,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, the 12 District leaders
will call for a free election.</font>

1277
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:45,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's little doubt
that Paylor will carry it.</font>

1278
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's become
the voice of reason.</font>

1279
01:54:47,239 --> 01:54:51,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry so much
burden fell on you.</font>

1280
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you'll never escape it.</font>

1281
01:54:54,439 --> 01:54:55,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I had to
put you through it again</font>

1282
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">for this outcome, I would.</font>

1283
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">The war's over.
We'll enter that sweet period</font>

1284
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:08,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">where everyone agrees not to
repeat the recent horrors.</font>

1285
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, we're fickle, stupid
beings, with poor memories</font>

1286
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:15,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a great gift
for self-destruction.</font>

1287
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:19,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, who knows?
Maybe this time, we'll learn.</font>

1288
01:55:21,399 --> 01:55:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've secured you a ride
out of The Capitol.</font>

1289
01:55:24,279 --> 01:55:26,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better for you
to be out of sight.</font>

1290
01:55:26,199 --> 01:55:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the time is right,</font>

1291
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:29,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Paylor
will pardon you.</font>

1292
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:32,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">The country
will find its peace.</font>

1293
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:35,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I hope
you can find yours.</font>

1294
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:36,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plutarch."</font>

1295
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">What now?</font>

1296
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Home.</font>

1297
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:46,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go home.</font>

1298
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:54,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.</font>

1299
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:03,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.</font>

1300
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:08,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me you'll find it.</font>

1301
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find What?</font>

1302
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:15,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">The life of a Victor.</font>

1303
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Goodbye, Effie.
- Goodbye, my girl.</font>

1304
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Effie, don't be a stranger.</font>

1305
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take care of her.
- I will.</font>

1306
01:58:05,479 --> 01:58:06,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gone.</font>

1307
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out!</font>

1308
01:58:19,359 --> 01:58:21,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out! Prim is gone!</font>

1309
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prim is gone!</font>

1310
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:26,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's dead!
And she's not coming back!</font>

1311
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out! Get out!</font>

1312
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:04,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeta?</font>

1313
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:09,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1314
02:00:11,239 --> 02:00:12,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came home.</font>

1315
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1316
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:24,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found these, uh,
out by the edge of the forest.</font>

1317
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a primrose.</font>

1318
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sorry, Katniss.</font>

1319
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:55,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You'll be happy to hear
that Katniss' mother</font>

units in The Capitol.</font>

our best with these lives.</font>

finding some peace.</font>

02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real or not real?</font>

1337
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:13,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real.</font>

1338
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.</font>

1339
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:11,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you
have a nightmare?</font>

1340
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have nightmares, too.</font>

1341
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:23,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday I'll explain it to you.</font>

1342
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why they came,</font>

1343
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:29,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">why they won't ever go away.</font>

1344
02:04:37,479 --> 02:04:39,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'll tell you
how I survive it.</font>

1345
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:44,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make a list in my head</font>

1346
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:46,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">of all the good things
I've seen someone do.</font>

1347
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every little thing
I can remember.</font>

1348
02:04:54,279 --> 02:04:55,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a game.</font>

1349
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do it over and over.</font>

1350
02:05:01,319 --> 02:05:04,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gets a little tedious
after all these years, but...</font>

1351
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">there are
much worse games to play.</font>
