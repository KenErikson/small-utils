00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.</font>

156
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dreams are coming back, Warren.</font>

157
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just won't go away, will it?</font>

158
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like breakfast in bed?</font>

159
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought so.</font>

160
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...</font>

161
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the church. We missed something.
There is movement in the frame.</font>

162
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.</font>

163
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.</font>

164
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The reason I was up all night.</font>

165
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lights.</font>

166
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.</font>

167
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:49,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...</font>

168
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">straining fingers as you switch them.</font>

169
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that was a real problem before,
you know.</font>

170
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toil in the darkness of sarcasm,
my friend.</font>

171
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:01,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer to work in the lights.</font>

172
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lights?</font>

173
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lights!</font>

174
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad acoustics.</font>

175
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natural light's better
for the environment anyway. Voila.</font>

176
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love that you boys are staying
in the house.</font>

177
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">But please don't try to fix anything else
that isn't broken.</font>

178
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spectral Sightings.</font>

179
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, she is.</font>

180
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise!</font>

181
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is Elise.
<i>- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i></font>

182
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.</font>

183
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,615
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i></font>

184
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,905
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Things are happening in my house...</i></font>

185
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,872
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and they say
that you know about this stuff.</i></font>

186
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know some things.</font>

187
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,089
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yeah, well, I was wondering
if you could take a look.</i></font>

188
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I need... I need help is the thing, see.</i></font>

189
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask where you live?</font>

190
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,267
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i></font>

191
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,345
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Five Keys, New Mexico.</i></font>

192
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Garza...</font>

193
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.</font>

194
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

195
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thank you very much
for thinking of me.</font>

196
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.</font>

197
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man who called today about a job...</font>

198
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">he told me he lives in the house
that I grew up in.</font>

199
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call it a house because it wasn't a...
A home.</font>

200
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.</font>

201
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">This gift I have
that you boys are so in awe of...</font>

202
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">my father tried to beat it out of me.</font>

203
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

204
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">my mother...</font>

205
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">she was killed in that house.</font>

206
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.</font>

207
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">This demon wants to use my abilities...</font>

208
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it will hurt the ones I love
to get to me.</font>

209
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I never want to go
into The Further...</font>

210
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I did for Quinn.</font>

211
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have spent my life fighting
these things...</font>

212
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.</font>

213
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

214
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to help this man...</font>

215
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I know what he's up against.</font>

216
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.</font>

217
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not this time.</font>

218
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one, I have to do...</font>

219
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">alone.</font>

220
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.</font>

221
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus 200 for the logo paint job.</font>

222
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we go inside...</font>

223
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought some clothes for you boys.</font>

224
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:13,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.</font>

225
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet I can guess who you are.</font>

226
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need. I'm Elise.</font>

227
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...</font>

228
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">my associates.</font>

229
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's psychic.</font>

230
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sidekick.</font>

231
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

232
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's psychic. We're sidekick.</font>

233
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:39,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.</font>

234
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna come in? Here.</font>

235
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. I'm supposed
to invite you in. Come on.</font>

236
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

237
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,198
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>—aggression.</i></font>

238
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,364
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i></font>

239
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,875
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i></font>

240
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,661
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>if we do not confront them...</i></font>

241
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still have so much of our old stuff.</font>

242
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:11,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all here.</font>

243
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty good stuff, you know?</font>

244
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.</font>

245
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's stories.</font>

246
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">About your family.</font>

247
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never listened to them
when they said that...</font>

248
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">this wasn't a place that I should live.</font>

249
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.</font>

250
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "Screw the stories,"
and I bought it.</font>

251
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I believe the stories.</font>

252
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">You getting anything?</font>

253
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are so many spirits,
it's hard to tell the good from the evil.</font>

254
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of people died in that prison.</font>

255
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did these occurrences start?</font>

256
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon after I moved in.</font>

257
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, it was...</font>

258
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">the little things, you know?</font>

259
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things that...</font>

260
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,151
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i></font>

261
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're special.</i></font>

262
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,336
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?</i></font>

263
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,964
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No. No!</i></font>

264
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

265
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.</font>

266
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">These experiences you're having...</font>

267
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">where do they mainly occur?</font>

268
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly in one room.</font>

269
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep it locked now.</font>

270
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't opened it in three months.</font>

271
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take that one.</font>

272
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna give me a hand?</font>

273
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.</font>

274
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little bit more.</font>

275
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

276
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't go in there.</font>

277
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it first started...</font>

278
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.</font>

279
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone was talking to themselves.</font>

280
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're going crazy,
and then you...</font>

281
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You actually hear it.</font>

282
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know you're not.</font>

283
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, one day, I walked in...</font>

284
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I screamed at it:</font>

285
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You stop."</font>

286
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You stop.</font>

287
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stop."</font>

288
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">My whole life savings is in this place.</font>

289
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta help me.</font>

290
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta help me, please.</font>

291
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:02,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we do.</font>

292
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.</font>

293
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call it the "Winneba-ghost."</font>

294
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm gonna go there now.</font>

295
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really are gonna stay here all alone?</font>

296
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:41,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">My presence tends to draw the spirits
out of their dark, little corners.</font>

297
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to take this.</font>

298
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

299
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

300
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you hear us, Elise?</font>

301
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:20,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Try not to drown out
the other voices.</font>

302
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,189
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We got you. We gone.</i></font>

303
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

304
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- Lights.</font>

305
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

306
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were gone forever.</font>

307
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,288
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My mother got this for my brother...</i></font>

308
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he lost it
when he was 6 years old.</font>

309
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Safe now.</font>

310
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop.
- What?</font>

311
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back, to the left.</font>

312
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yeah, nothing.</font>

313
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought I saw some feet.</font>

314
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feet?</font>

315
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:12,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise, there's someone
right in front of you.</font>

316
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,061
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Looks like a woman.</i></font>

317
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see anything.</font>

318
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:21,570
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Elise, be careful.</i></font>

319
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see what you're seeing.</font>

320
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're going to touch it.</i></font>

321
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

322
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help her.</font>

323
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise? Elise? What happened?</font>

324
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whistle.</font>

325
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took the whistle.</font>

326
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you doing in there?</font>

327
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you were gonna stay
in the bedroom.</font>

328
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something led me down there.</font>

329
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">The spirit of a woman.</font>

330
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...</font>

331
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this house.</font>

332
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 16 years old.</font>

333
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear that?</font>

334
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear what?</font>

335
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone in the laundry room.</font>

336
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there isn't.</font>

337
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard it.</font>

338
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go look.</font>

339
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:52,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Don't, Elise.</font>

340
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

341
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live here with my brother, Christian.</font>

342
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Stop it.</font>

343
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making it up.</font>

344
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:13,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.</font>

345
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian!</font>

346
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, girl?</font>

347
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone in the laundry.</font>

348
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one in here.</font>

349
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing it again.</font>

350
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</font>

351
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's one thing...</font>

352
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've been doing
your whole life, Elise...</font>

353
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's ask for it.</font>

354
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:13,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't let you hurt me anymore.</font>

355
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:18,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

356
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise.</font>

357
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise!</font>

358
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise, don't go!</font>

359
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave her be. Leave her be.</font>

360
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs to learn that nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</font>

361
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't been back here since.</font>

362
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's all for tonight.</font>

363
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll pick it up tomorrow.</font>

364
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:10,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian and I came here a lot as kids.</font>

365
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:12,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I look okay?</font>

366
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course.</font>

367
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

368
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I...</font>

369
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just look so much
like someone I know very well.</font>

370
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

371
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Elise.</font>

372
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Melissa.</font>

373
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imogen.</font>

374
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.</font>

375
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tucker.</font>

376
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Specs.</font>

377
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Specs. Or Steven.</font>

378
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever. Your choice.</font>

379
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's psychic, and we're sidekick.</font>

380
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

381
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it.</font>

382
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.</font>

383
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it's pretty <i>confidencial.</i></font>

384
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a poltergeist infestation
involving Ted Garza.</font>

385
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?</font>

386
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ghosts and ghouls.</font>

387
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">What he's trying to say
is we're ghost hunters.</font>

388
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">The three of us.</font>

389
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of like cops.</font>

390
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only we don't arrest humans.</font>

391
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm funny too. A lot of the time.</font>

392
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.</font>

393
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?</font>

394
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to live in this town
a long time ago.</font>

395
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good for you. You got out.</font>

396
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...</font>

397
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:48,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not.</font>

398
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really nice to meet you.</font>

399
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.</font>

400
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?</font>

401
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Christian.</font>

402
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I aged that much?</font>

403
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, aren't you gonna say anything?</font>

404
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

405
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, come on. Let's go.</font>

406
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- We just got here.</font>

407
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear me out.</font>

408
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm... I'm still your sister, and...</font>

409
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">That only means something if I choose it
to mean something, and I choose it not to.</font>

410
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Christian.</font>

411
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.</font>

412
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:41,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?</font>

413
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.</font>

414
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me. You listen.</font>

415
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, when we were children,
you terrified me.</font>

416
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You scared the life out of me...</font>

417
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">with stories about a monster
behind a red door...</font>

418
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:58,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then you opened the door
and you left.</font>

419
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left me.</font>

420
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">You abandoned me to a real monster,
our father.</font>

421
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:09,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.</font>

422
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay away.</font>

423
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian.</font>

424
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:24,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian!</font>

425
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was stupid to come back here.</font>

426
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you weren't. You're helping people.</font>

427
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you do, remember?</font>

428
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elise.</font>

429
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

430
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can be unreasonable sometimes.</font>

431
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knowing what he grew up with,
that's perfectly understandable.</font>

432
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's never told us anything
about his childhood.</font>

433
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never even seen a picture.</font>

434
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:56,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never told us anything about you.</font>

435
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:01,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.</font>

436
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a great dad, you know?</font>

437
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love him a lot.</font>

438
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea how happy
that makes me, honey.</font>

439
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?</font>

440
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have the still frames
that we printed?</font>

441
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.</font>

442
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?</font>

443
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.</font>

444
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

445
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

446
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. You give this to your dad...</font>

447
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you tell him it was taken yesterday
in our old bedroom.</font>

448
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think he will be
very surprised to see it.</font>

449
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so happy to meet you.</font>

450
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

451
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Testing. One, two.</font>

452
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you hear me, guys?</font>

453
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- I noticed this last night...</font>

454
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I couldn't quite place it.</font>

455
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then Christian reminded me
that when I was a child...</font>

456
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a red door.</font>

457
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:28,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">The entity that killed my mother
came through it.</font>

458
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.</font>

459
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.</font>

460
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember when I went into The Further
to find Quinn Brenner?</font>

461
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came across a red door.</font>

462
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:49,177
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And I... I passed through it,
and it took me deeper into The Further.</i></font>

463
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can find out what it means...</font>

464
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to stop the thing
that's haunting this house.</font>

465
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this might help.</font>

466
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spoke to you last night.</font>

467
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you there? Can you hear me?</font>

468
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took something from me.</font>

469
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

470
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:29,931
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i></font>

471
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:31,432
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Help who?</i></font>

472
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

473
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you?</font>

474
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whistle once for yes, twice for no.</font>

475
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you the woman I saw last night?</font>

476
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there an entity in this house...</font>

477
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:28,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?</font>

478
00:48:33,284 --> 00:48:35,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you that entity?</font>

479
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there something
you're trying to show me?</font>

480
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is what you want to show me...</font>

481
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">behind this wall?</font>

482
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keys.</font>

483
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze, buddy. Freeze.</font>

484
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">On.</font>

485
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. On.</font>

486
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

487
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

488
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you wanna show me?</font>

489
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:24,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help her!</font>

490
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me.</font>

491
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a ghost.</font>

492
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

493
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

494
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll break the chain.</font>

495
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you won't.</font>

496
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:13,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move.</font>

497
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:14,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from her!</font>

498
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you, help me get rid of the ghost.</font>

499
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me get rid of it!</font>

500
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Help me!</i></font>

501
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you have to come down here?</font>

502
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Your ghost led us down here.</font>

503
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in my head.</font>

504
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in my head.</font>

505
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your friend?</font>

506
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is your friend.</font>

507
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">You there, Specs?</font>

508
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Specs!</font>

509
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

510
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name is Mara Jennings.</font>

511
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.</font>

512
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been missing
for approximately four months.</font>

513
00:56:31,637 --> 00:56:33,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch your step down.</font>

514
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.</font>

515
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to get statements
from all of you.</font>

516
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are plenty of demons in this world
who are very much alive...</font>

517
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you stopped one of them.</font>

518
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Elise.</font>

519
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, this is crazy.</font>

520
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:51,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is something I have to do.</font>

521
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:00,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I gotta find it.</i></font>

522
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little whistle,
a little silver whistle.</font>

523
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I deal in the spirit world...</font>

524
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:13,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">and spirits can make people
do bad things in the real world.</font>

525
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of these people come to me
for help.</font>

526
00:58:18,577 --> 00:58:20,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to you, that's weird.</font>

527
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:23,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me, it's a day job.</font>

528
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one was different though.</font>

529
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:33,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">The haunted house was my house.</font>

530
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not in here.</font>

531
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm gonna check on him.</font>

532
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would Garza invite you up...</font>

533
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">knowing the risk
that you might discover Mara?</font>

534
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:58,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">These hauntings can be terrifying things.</font>

535
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the fear of the beyond...</font>

536
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:05,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">overcame the fear of getting caught.</font>

537
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe he wanted to get caught.</font>

538
00:59:12,673 --> 00:59:14,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What is it?</font>

539
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm seeing things.</font>

541
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.</font>

542
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you need me for anything else?</font>

543
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

544
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

545
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:38,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Melissa?</font>

546
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:41,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

547
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down here, honey. I found the whistle.</font>

548
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

549
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?</font>

550
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to her? Where is she?</font>

551
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.</font>

552
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, no.</font>

553
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imogen, call an ambulance.</font>

554
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

555
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know where she was?</font>

556
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to her?</font>

557
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something evil in that house...</font>

558
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I let it into this world.</font>

559
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it made Ted Garza do
what he did...</font>

560
01:03:39,606 --> 01:03:42,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's taken your sister's spirit,
and I'm gonna find it...</font>

561
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna finish it tonight.</font>

562
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:48,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see things too.</font>

563
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a little girl...</font>

564
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to sleep
and floated out of my bedroom...</font>

565
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the way
to our elderly neighbor's house.</font>

566
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:13,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.</font>

567
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad told me
she had died the night before.</font>

568
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him I already knew.</font>

569
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.</font>

570
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, honey.</font>

571
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I... I'm staying.</font>

572
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just trust me, okay?</font>

573
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:38,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.</font>

574
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a...</font>

575
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.</font>

576
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need things
that were important to Garza.</font>

577
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Specs, go upstairs.</font>

578
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:55,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a Bible he held very dear to him.</font>

579
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.</font>

580
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:01,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.</font>

581
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.</font>

582
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tucker and I are going down
to the fallout shelter.</font>

583
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get the death chamber,
he gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?</font>

584
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a democracy.</font>

585
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the only one I trust
to go down there with me.</font>

586
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't patronize me, woman.</font>

587
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why do you guys dress like that?</font>

588
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.</font>

589
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, my usual style's a lot more laid back.</font>

590
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little weird.</font>

591
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Dude.</font>

592
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.</font>

593
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:44,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.</font>

594
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just saying.</font>

595
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.</font>

596
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:52,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.</font>

597
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta do stuff like that.</font>

598
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something here.</font>

599
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel it.</font>

600
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants me to have it.</font>

601
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:11,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that should do it.</font>

602
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.</font>

603
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to sleep.</font>

604
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:15,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this slip.</font>

605
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:18,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.</font>

606
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, let me go. I beg you.</font>

607
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

609
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:29,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise I won't tell.</font>

610
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,543

613
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:14,791

630
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,182

- Yes.</font>

663
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.</font>

664
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,926

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?</font>

676
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't say...
- I can do it.</font>

677
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can help her.</font>

678
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:35,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never actually hypnotized
anybody before.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been hypnotized.</font>

680
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:39,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?</font>

681
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

682
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:52,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.</font>

686
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:00,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look here.</font>

687
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">And concentrate on it and just relax.</font>

688
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:08,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine that your body is made of water
and you're in the ocean.</font>

689
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make sense.</font>

690
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- She's made of water...</font>

691
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.</font>

692
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to do this?</font>

693
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:26,157

695
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move away.</font>

696
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes.</font>

697
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to the ticking.</font>

698
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Focus on it.</font>

699
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to count back from five.</font>

700

704
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:23,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...</font>

705
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:26,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will be on the other side.</font>

706
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,515
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now.</i></font>

707
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:57,832

708
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll help you.</font>

Elise was talking about.</font>

712

<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the place.</font>

713
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,145

01:21:44,315 --> 01:21:46,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he finds me, he'll...</font>

715
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,398

716
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,779

what you're looking for in there.</font>
