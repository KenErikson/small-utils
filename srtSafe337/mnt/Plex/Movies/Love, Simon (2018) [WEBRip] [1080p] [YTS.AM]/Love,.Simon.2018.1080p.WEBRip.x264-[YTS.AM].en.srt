<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Spier. Hey, Abby.</font>

150
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:06,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

151
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excited to rehearse
with you later.</font>

152
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:11,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, so, fun fact.</font>

153
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that <i>Cabaret</i>
was actually based off a play</font>

154
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:14,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">called <i>I Am Camera?</i></font>

155
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then <i>I Am a Camera</i>
was based off</font>

156
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:18,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">this novel called
<i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i></font>

157
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">And <i>Goodbye to Berlin</i>
was actually based off</font>

158
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:22,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher Isherwood's</font>

159
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">early years in Berlin.</font>

160
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. That's awesome.
I have homeroom.</font>

161
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:27,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. All right.</font>

162
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think she
found that interesting.</font>

163
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, Martin.</font>

164
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, big boy.</font>

165
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suraj! Now.</font>

166
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. You know the drill.</font>

167
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,642
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've had an inspiration.
How about</i> The Affair?</font>

168
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:45,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. We cannot watch
<i>The Affair</i> as a family.</font>

169
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:48,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Because it's all about sex.</font>

170
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, God forbid we should
watch people make love.</font>

171
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:51,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

172
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
You guys are so repressed.</font>

173
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:57,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't therapize us, okay?
We are not your patients.</font>

174
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're your family.
- That's true.</font>

175
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were my patients, you'd
be much more well-adjusted.</font>

176
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. Nice therapy burn, baby.
- Thank you.</font>

177
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She got you.
- You know what?</font>

178
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't see last week's
episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i></font>

179
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, how did that guy
even become the bachelor?</font>

180
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:09,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

181
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's clearly gay.</font>

182
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, he's not.
- Really?</font>

183
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:14,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's handsome.
- That date,</font>

184
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">where he took the girl to</font>

185
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:17,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">the "make your
own perfume" place?</font>

186
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad! The producers
plan those dates.</font>

187
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:20,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is so fruity.
He's so fruity.</font>

188
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a one-man pride parade.
Are you kidding me?</font>

189
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He has more chemistry
- Just stop it.</font>

190
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Chris Harrison,
than any of those girls.</font>

191
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">After this, I gotta
show you something.</font>

192
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?
Let's watch <i>The Americans.</i></font>

193
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single episode,
you here next to me.</font>

194
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:35,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">So your mother decided
that we should make</font>

195
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">each other anniversary
presents this year.</font>

196
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:39,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, so they came
from the heart, or some crap.</font>

197
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I decided to come up
with this bad boy.</font>

198
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:42,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.</font>

199
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I present to you,
a Jack Spier production.</font>

200
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:51,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.</font>

201
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that!</font>

202
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's so good.</font>

203
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.
Wait, wait, wait.</font>

204
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup. Okay.</font>

205
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:08,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you...</font>

206
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this is your
20th anniversary,</font>

207
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm gonna be super real
with you right now.</font>

208
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">This looks
like a fourth grader made it.</font>

209
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:18,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not even the smartest
fourth grader in the class.</font>

210
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just, like,
a deeply average fourth grader.</font>

211
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?
This is amazing.</font>

212
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:24,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got fade-ins.
I got dissolves.</font>

- Get up for a second.</font>

214
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll help you. Trust me.</font>

215
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:29,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can make this good.
We just gotta put in...</font>

216
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, some home video.</font>

217
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe put in some better music.</font>

218
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Better music"? This was huge
when we were young.</font>

219
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So was Bill Cosby.</font>

220

00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:05,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Yeah.</font>

296
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.</font>

297
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seriously.
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

298
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I just get
my phone though?</font>

299
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:10,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Unfortunately, I'm gonna
have to keep it</font>

300
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">until after play practice.</font>

301
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you will get your precious</font>

302
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:15,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">after play practice, okay?
I promise.</font>

303
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:16,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how's play practice going?</font>

304
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Great. Yeah, it's...
- How's Ms. Albright?</font>

305
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's good.</font>

306
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's good?
She doesn't like men.</font>

307
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:50,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

308
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:54,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those aren't actual claps.
My hands are tired!</font>

309
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay! All right.</font>

310
00:16:57,804 --> 00:16:58,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was...</font>

311
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cal, help me. That was...</font>

312
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:02,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a start?</font>

313
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a start!
Is what it was.</font>

314
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a start.</font>

315
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, when Mr. Worth
told me that no student,</font>

316
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">regardless of talent...</font>

317
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:14,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to be left out of
my production, I had my doubts.</font>

318
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did.</font>

319
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

320
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:21,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.
That's my whole speech.</font>

321
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:22,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Albright.</font>

322
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. That was
the biggest train wreck</font>

323
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">our stage has ever seen.</font>

324
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:27,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Rob and Brianne</font>

325
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">were practically dry
humping the whole song.</font>

326
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I saw.</font>

327
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:34,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save the kissing
for the cast party. All right?</font>

328
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:38,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is war. You're Nazis.
Okay? More anger.</font>

329
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suraj, stop pretending
that trumpet is your penis!</font>

330

<font color="#FFFFFF">My boy.</font>

331
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a rental.</font>

332
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was an extra
in <i>The Lion King,</i></font>

333

334
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:54,393

335
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten minutes since the last time
you asked. Go.</font>

336
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">One! Two! Three! Four!</font>

337
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,836

339
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:08,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Worth.
- Hey, what's up, my brother?</font>

340
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, just here for my phone.</font>

341
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, of course you are.
Of course you are.</font>

342
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you enjoy
being unplugged?</font>

343
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:15,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was great.</font>

344
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Great, right?
- Yeah.</font>

345
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't life, man.
This is plugged.</font>

346
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is unplugged.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

347
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plugged. Unplugged.</font>

348
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:25,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Simon, I know that
I'm hard on you. I really do.</font>

349
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

350
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's only 'cause I really
see myself in you.</font>

351
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... You know, I don't know
if I'd say that.</font>

352
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:33,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I see it, it's obvious.
It's obvious.</font>

353
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know there's a lot</font>

354
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:36,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- going on there, man.
- Yup.</font>

355
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I bet you got
a lot of questions.</font>

356
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:40,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there something
you wanna say to me?</font>

357
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:41,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

358
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know my policy.
What does it say?</font>

359
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Open door. Open ears."
- "Open door. Open ears."</font>

360
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:47,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing
you want to say?</font>

361
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nope.
- You sure?</font>

362
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:50,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

363
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a great sign though.
- Thank you.</font>

364
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Now don't text and drive.</font>

365
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:54,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how my cat
got murdered.</font>

366
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:56,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

367
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:59,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just kidding.
I don't have cats. I got asthma.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A secret, huh?</i></font>

369
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,246
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Is it the same as my secret?</i></font>

370
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,715
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If it is, when did you know?</i></font>

371
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Have you told anyone? Blue.</i></font>

372
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:28,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

373
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,301
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, Blue.
I haven't told anyone.</i></font>

374
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:47,204
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And, honestly, I can't even
really explain why.</i></font>

375
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,942
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Deep down, I know my family
would be fine with it.</i></font>

376
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what rhymes
with "patriarchy"?</font>

377
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">That says "patriachy" though.</font>

378
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

379
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:00,218

no one even cared.</i></font>

384
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I have something
to tell you.</font>

385
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:13,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gay.</font>

386
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, really?
That's really great, Ethan.</font>

387
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. No way.</font>

388
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:22,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you are?
I had no idea.</font>

389
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a complete surprise!</font>

390
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:25,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too much, Claire.</font>

391
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:28,314
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As for how I knew
I was gay,</i></font>

392
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>it was a bunch of
little things.</i></font>

393
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,317
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like this one recurring dream</i></font>

394
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:34,252
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I kept having
about Daniel Radcliffe.</i></font>

395
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then proceeded to have
every night for a month.</i></font>

396
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,701
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I was obsessed
with Panic! at the Disco.</i></font>

397
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. He's so cute.
He's so cute.</font>

398
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on,
he's like Jesus and chocolate.</font>

399
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:58,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look at him.</font>

400
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,278
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then I realized</i></font>

401
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:00,913
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>it really wasn't
about the music.</i></font>

402
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:02,991
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then there was
my first girlfriend.</i></font>

403
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm falling
in love with you.</font>

404

You're glowing, man.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

444
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,518

You look happy.</font>

last night. Oh, God.</font>

450
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was not into it.</font>

465
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:02,424

agree to disagree.</font>

470
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:09,635

<font color="#FFFFFF">Bram, that's terrible news!</font>

480
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:26,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but it's like,</font>

481
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:28,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">the third time
it's happened to her.</font>

482
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has really bad taste in men.</font>

483
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:33,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways, my mom is going down
to Orlando to deal with it</font>

484
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:37,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means I get to throw
a Halloween party.</font>

485
00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:39,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Awesome!

Bram's dumb-ass aunt!</font>

488
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, this is
gonna be epic, you guys.</font>

489
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can bring
my karaoke machine.</font>

490
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, hey, guys,
Halloween party Friday night!</font>

491
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friday night, Halloween party,
okay? Bram's house!</font>

492
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really set this
in motion, man.</font>

493
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:51,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, right?</font>

494
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:52,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, little guy.
- Me?</font>

495
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halloween party. Friday night.
Bram's house. Be there.</font>

496
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:57,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna
freak him out, man.</font>

497
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:57,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

498
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:59,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
He's, like, nine years old.</font>

499
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:09,692
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Very relieved that
we're in agreement on Oreos.</i></font>

500
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:11,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That would have been
a deal-breaker for me.</i></font>

501
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,334
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>On a totally different,
non-cookie related note...</i></font>

502

what you look like,</i></font>

503
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:22,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can't stop thinking
about kissing you.</font>

504
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon. Simon.</font>

505

Rob and Brianne.</font>

507
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the most action
I've seen in weeks.</font>

508
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we got here? Ah!</font>

509
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we're done,
it's gonna look</font>

510
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a real German sex club.
Don't ask me how I know.</font>

511
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:53,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey! The spray paint
is for painting,</font>

512
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:54,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">not for huffing.</font>

513
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want
to get good at that.</font>

514
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, do you guys think
I should dye my hair grey</font>

515
00:25:58,076 --> 00:25:59,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to play <i>Fräulein</i> Schneider?
- Sure.</font>

516
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? But my hair
is kind of like my thing.</font>

517
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:03,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get a soda.</font>

518
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want anything?</font>

519
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:05,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

520
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">You disgust me.</font>

521
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:17,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon! Hey, hey, hey.</font>

522
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Martin.

523
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:23,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, um, I used the computer
in the library right after you.</font>

524
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:24,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

525
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:28,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I went to Gmail,
and it pulled up your account.</font>

526
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I, uh, read
some of your emails.</font>

527
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:32,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know
I probably shouldn't've,</font>

528
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:33,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they were, like,
right there.</font>

529
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you'll be interested
to know my brother's gay.</font>

530
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Martin, that wouldn't
interest me to know.</font>

531
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:45,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Don't worry.
I won't show anyone.</font>

532
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:47,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show anyone what?</font>

533
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you print my emails
or something?</font>

534
00:26:51,863 --> 00:26:53,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no.</font>

535
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:55,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I screenshot them.</font>

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You screenshotted my emails?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.</font>

537
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me talk to you for a second.</font>

538
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Ms. Bradley.
- Hello, Martin.</font>

539
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you feather your hair?
- No.</font>

540
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking good.</font>

541
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a good section.</font>

542
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:10,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez.</font>

543
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:13,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, why the hell
did you screenshot my emails?</font>

544
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, well, you and Abby Susso
are good friends. Right?</font>

545
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:17,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We know each other.</font>

546
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that have to do
with anything?</font>

547
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I need you to help me
talk with her...</font>

548
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:24,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hang out with her
and stuff, you know?</font>

549
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:26,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I help you do that?</font>

550
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you blackmailing me?</font>

551
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:31,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shh! Okay. Don't be
so dramatic here, Simon.</font>

552
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:33,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sup, Tyler?</font>

553
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:35,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Tyler?
Is that a Patagonia?</font>

554
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice. I just like her.</font>

555
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:41,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think
that you could help me.</font>

556
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what if I say no, Martin?</font>

557
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what are you gonna do?</font>

558
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna tell the whole school
that I'm...</font>

559
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:48,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna leak my emails?</font>

560
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:49,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna post 'em
on <i>CreekSecrets?</i></font>

561
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think
that we're in a position here,</font>

562
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:54,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">where we could help
each other out is all.</font>

563
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:56,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">So think about it.</font>

564
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:58,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good talk.</font>

565
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I never thought
of a pepper</font>

566
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:09,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">as being a vegetable...</font>

567
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:10,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it makes perfect sense.</font>

568
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:13,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like the cilantro.
A little Mexican flair, huh?</font>

569
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very creative, kiddo.</font>

570
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hate the peppers.
Don't you?</font>

571
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. The peppers are great.</font>

572
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:23,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna get some air.</font>

573

00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:31,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

589
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:37,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon, that is fantastic news.</font>

590
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really think that Abby and I
are meant to be together.</font>

591
00:29:39,998 --> 00:29:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really? Do you?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

592
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:42,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not all about looks, Simon.</font>

593
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:45,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. So you're banking
on your great,</font>

594
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:47,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">blackmaily personality
to get the job done?</font>

595
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are we going?
- Your place.</font>

596
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:50,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna see
if you have anything</font>

597
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">that doesn't scream,
"punch me."</font>

598
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:54,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I've got swim lessons.</font>

599
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:55,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cancel it!</font>

600
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I just have to
call my mom first.</font>

601
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has to approve everybody
that comes in the house.</font>

602
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Here we go.</font>

603
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:08,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. And here we are.</font>

604
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:10,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where the magic happens.</font>

605
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:11,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

606
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:14,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Correction.</font>

607
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where the magic happens.</font>

608
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been dabbling
in close-up illusions.</font>

609
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:22,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does Abby like magic?</font>

610
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:24,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Martin, I don't think
she does like magic.</font>

611
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:25,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, um,
there's a really thin line</font>

612
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:29,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">between laughing with someone,
and laughing at someone.</font>

613
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:30,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are that line.</font>

614
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:32,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">So,
if you want Abby to like you,</font>

615
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:33,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you have to do
is you have to</font>

616
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">make her see you
as more of a...</font>

617
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:36,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">As sexy Martin!</font>

618
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Yeah, I could be sexy.</font>

619
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like dudes. Tell me.</font>

620
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:45,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">What part of me
do you find the hottest?</font>

621
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. I'm not doing this.
- No. Come on.</font>

622
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Martin.
I don't want to answer that.</font>

623
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:49,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you said my shoulders</font>

624
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:52,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would dress to accentuate.
You know?</font>

625
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
Here's your first tip.</font>

626
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:55,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripped.</font>

627
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, they don't want
to read your clothes.</font>

628
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:00,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're wrong
about that one.</font>

629
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:02,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many of these do you have?</font>

630
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, just stop! Hey! Stop!</font>

631
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't want your help
in changing me.</font>

632
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:13,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want your help in getting
Abby to like me for me.</font>

633
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:17,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Um...</font>

634
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:21,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a party this Saturday.
At Bram's.</font>

635
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:26,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to go
with my friends and I?</font>

636
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:27,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

637
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:30,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! So simple.</font>

638
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be why
they call you Simple Simon.</font>

639
00:31:32,877 --> 00:31:34,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody calls me that, Martin.</font>

640
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:37,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, do you want to,
like, sleep over?</font>

641
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

642
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:50,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello.</font>

643
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:52,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's up?</font>

644
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice, right?
- Nick.</font>

645
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:54,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good?</font>

646
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:57,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is, like, a new level of
laziness, even for you.</font>

647
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?
I'm Cristiano Ronaldo.</font>

648
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:00,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you couldn't
even be bothered</font>

649
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:02,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">to fill in the letters
on the back?</font>

650
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:04,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, come on. Give me that.</font>

651
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a bully.</font>

652
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:11,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Don't
talk about Yoko that way, man.</font>

653
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if you do,
you're out of the band.</font>

654
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you guys
supposed to be?</font>

655
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:18,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">John Lennon and Yoko Ono.</font>

656
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:20,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! I thought she was the girl
from <i>The Ring,</i></font>

657
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you were Jesus.</font>

658
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:25,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus? No. Why would Jesus be
wearing a white suit?</font>

659
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:27,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. You tell me.</font>

660
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:29,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who decided to
dress up like fancy Jesus.</font>

661
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Okay. Come here.</font>

662
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Turn around.
- I'm here.</font>

663
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:32,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Turn around.
- Okay.</font>

664
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:34,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Is it good?</font>

665
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:35,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Way better.
- Is it?</font>

666
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:36,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Now, we need to do
something about this hair.</font>

667
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe slick it back?</font>

668
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:40,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't do that.
It doesn't slick back.</font>

669
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:41,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonder Woman in the hizzy!</font>

670
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:42,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!</font>

671
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:44,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made up a catchphrase,</font>

672
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause Wonder Woman
doesn't have one.</font>

673
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:48,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hizzy" means house.</font>

674
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:49,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

675
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

676
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Abby, you look amazing.</font>

677
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:54,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

678
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:57,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You look awesome.</font>

679
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go make
those frozen pizzas.</font>

680
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

681
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:02,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll help.</font>

682
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a nice costume, for real.</font>

683
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:08,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
What? Cristiano Ronaldo!</font>

684
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:09,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nailed it.</font>

685
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember
when we went to school</font>

686
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">dressed as Charlie's Angels?</font>

687
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:13,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, yes.</font>

688
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:15,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Nick's balls fell out
of his booty shorts</font>

689
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he, like, dropped down
to do the gun pose?</font>

690
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. Do you miss
trick-or-treating?</font>

691
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:21,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you mean
instead of, like,</font>

692
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">going to loud parties</font>

693
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">pretending to like
the taste of beer</font>

694
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">and feeling too self-conscious
to dance?</font>

695
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why
you feel self-conscious.</font>

696
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:30,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you are very clearly</font>

697
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:31,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">the coolest person
at our school.</font>

698
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:35,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who feels that way.</font>

699
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:37,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">But thank you.</font>

700
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:44,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that?</font>

701
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invited Martin.</font>

702
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:48,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Martin Addison?
- Why?</font>

703
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:49,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this a Make-A-Wish situation?</font>

704
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's cool.</font>

705
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

706
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:58,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, looking sharp.</font>

707
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...</font>

708
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys.
- What are you supposed to be?</font>

709
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:03,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't it obvious?</font>

710
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! I'm a Freudian slip.</font>

711
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:10,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abby. Wonder Woman.</font>

712
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:16,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pick a song already.</font>

713
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Nick, uh,
can you not rush me?</font>

714
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:22,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, I can't
choose. There's so many.</font>

715
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's like Netflix.</font>

716
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, trying to pick
a film on Netflix.</font>

717
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:28,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm like...
"Am I in an Apatow mood,</font>

718
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:31,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">or am I in a Billy Wilder
mood?" You know?</font>

719
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, play Drake. Yes.</font>

720
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no. Drake is, like,
super played out at this point.</font>

721
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:39,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't play out a rap god.
Doesn't happen.</font>

722
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:40,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impossible.</font>

723
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">First of all,
he's not a rap god.</font>

724
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:43,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">And second of all,
I'm looking for some Beyoncé.</font>

725
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- I just can't find "Lemonade."</font>

726
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Here's an
interesting question.</font>

727
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love Beyoncé.</font>

728
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:49,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you guys
feel nostalgic?</font>

729
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

730
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:52,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I think everybody
kinda likes Beyoncé.</font>

731
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grape soda makes me
feel very nostalgic.</font>

732
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you talking about?
- What makes you feel nostalgic?</font>

733
00:34:57,382 --> 00:34:58,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abby.</font>

734
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you're gonna have
the best costume tonight.</font>

735
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks.
- Nah, you're welcome.</font>

736
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:08,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell, Spier?</font>

737
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:10,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, why is Nick
still flirting with Abby?</font>

738
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:12,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Martin.</font>

739
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you shouldn't have
worn a dress.</font>

740
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look like a drag queen</font>

741
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">rolled around
in magnetic poetry.</font>

742
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Abby!</font>

743
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you need a refill
of your drink,</font>

744
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be
your designated bartender.</font>

745
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:26,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't worry.</font>

746
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:28,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Hey, Chloe, come here!</font>

747
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:30,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, yo, yo!</font>

748
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:32,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. John Lennon?</font>

749
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. You got it.

750
00:35:34,418 --> 00:35:36,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, um, Nick...</font>

751
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:40,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're Nick.
- No. No. I'm Ronaldo.</font>

752
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. My bad.
- Obviously.</font>

753
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:43,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you supposed to be?</font>

754
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:46,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Uh... I am post-presidency
Barack Obama.</font>

755
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm just chillin' in
Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais,</font>

756
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">writing memoirs and hoping</font>

757

<font color="#FFFFFF">Trump doesn't destroy
my legacy.</font>

758
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome.</font>

759
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Now let's go
to the bar. Come on.</font>

760
00:35:58,275 --> 00:35:59,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

761
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell yeah.</font>

762
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Garrett, no.</font>

763
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:14,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, we should
have a little toast.</font>

764
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thanks. I'm driving.</font>

765
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:17,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Simon doesn't
really drink.</font>

766
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I drink. It's cool. I drink.</font>

767
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:20,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, that's my man.
- Really?</font>

768
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't even have a glass</font>

769
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:22,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Manischewitz

770
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Halloween, man.
It's a special occasion.</font>

771
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:26,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">True that.</font>

772
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:28,204

00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:46,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abby is the hottest
Wonder Woman I have ever seen.</font>

776
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

777
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:49,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shit that I would let her
do to me with that lasso.</font>

778
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:50,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know, man.</font>

779
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just, like, tie me up
with that thing.</font>

780
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:55,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not into Abby, are you?</font>

781
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

782
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's not like I...
She's cute...</font>

783
00:36:58,869 --> 00:36:59,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

784
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she's just not really
my type.</font>

785
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not because she's black.
I love black women.</font>

786
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:07,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like, you know, I have
a thing for black women,</font>

787
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just love all women.</font>

788
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,018

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Mm.</font>

791
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna go ask her out.
- What? No.</font>

792
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:26,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No? No?
- No.</font>

793
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:28,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't ask Abby out.
- Why not?</font>

794
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:33,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because. She didn't tell you
about Jonathan?</font>

795
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:34,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't tell you about that?</font>

796
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:35,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.

799
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:43,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I've only had sex
once, right?</font>

800
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:44,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that.</font>

801
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:45,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
it's like no one tells you</font>

802
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:46,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">how dark everything is</font>

803
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:49,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how slippery everything
gets, and, you know,</font>

804
00:37:49,452 --> 00:37:50,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">the parts you think
are the right parts</font>

805
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:51,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">are actually
the wrong parts and...</font>

806
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm gonna go eat
my feelings away.</font>

807
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:57,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I'm sorry...</font>

808
00:37:58,096 --> 00:37:59,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.</font>

809
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:02,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa.</font>

810
00:38:07,672 --> 00:38:08,706

00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's play Beirut.</font>

820
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I don't...

821
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.</font>

822
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:29,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good old competition.</font>

823
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.</font>

824
00:38:33,164 --> 00:38:34,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beirut. Right?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Cool.</font>

832
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:48,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we were talking
about a different game.</font>

833
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:50,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just explain

00:39:21,646 --> 00:39:22,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fly it away. Fly it away.</font>

849
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:26,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chug, chug, chug.</font>

850
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,536

<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

859
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm starting to get so tired!

860
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Martin, not now, man.
All right?</font>

861
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:04,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had a big night.</font>

862

something really sad...</font>

875
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:47,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

876
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:49,858

<font color="#FFFFFF">Too sad!</font>

879
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:53,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">God. Okay, then just,
you know what,</font>

880
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't say anything at all...</font>

881
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll ditch the barf shirt
till tomorrow.</font>

882
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

883
00:41:58,869 --> 00:41:59,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Si?
- Yeah.</font>

884
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just as little
as possible,</font>

885
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">say as little as possible.</font>

886
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:13,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how does that work?</font>

887
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:15,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I remember
when I went to...</font>

888
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys!</font>

889
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:19,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- Hey!</font>

890
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:20,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come talk to us.
- Hey!</font>

891
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How was the party?
- It was really fun.</font>

892
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was it?
- Yeah.</font>

893
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:25,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aces.</font>

894
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

895
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:32,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, well. Thanks for
letting me stay over.</font>

896
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:33,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

897
00:42:34,202 --> 00:42:35,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been
staying over 10 years.</font>

898
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to thank us.</font>

899
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah, thanks.</font>

900
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Shh!</font>

901
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">John Lennon was wearing
a woman's sweater.</font>

902
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm.
- And he's drunk.</font>

903
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Definitely.
- So how do we feel about that?</font>

904
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:52,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he didn't drive drunk,</font>

905
00:42:52,688 --> 00:42:54,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's home
before curfew, so...</font>

906
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. That's what I thought
we thought.</font>

907
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's what
we think, right?</font>

908
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. We're good parents.
- Yeah, we're good parents.</font>

909
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:01,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

910
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">The room stopped spinning.</font>

911
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ever feel weird?</font>

912
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:24,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Weird?
- Yeah.</font>

913
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I feel like
I'm always on the outside.</font>

914
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:34,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

915
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like tonight, you know...</font>

916
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:39,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was at that party,
and it was fun, but...</font>

917
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:43,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">it kinda felt like
I was watching it</font>

918
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:44,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">from across the room.</font>

919
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know,
there's this invisible line</font>

920
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I have to cross</font>

921
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">to really be a part
of everything</font>

922
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just,
I can't ever cross it.</font>

923
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel that way
sometimes, too.</font>

924
00:43:57,856 --> 00:43:58,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not tonight you didn't.</font>

925
00:43:59,088 --> 00:44:00,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was trying something.</font>

926
00:44:02,126 --> 00:44:03,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, sometimes I think
it'd be so much easier</font>

927
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:06,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be one of these people who
can just take a few shots</font>

928
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:08,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then hook up
with whoever's closest.</font>

929
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess I'm just unlucky.</font>

930
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:13,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlucky?</font>

931
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:16,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

932
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm not
a casual person.</font>

933
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of person are you?</font>

934
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:29,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm the kind of person</font>

935
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">who is destined
to care so much</font>

936
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">about one person,
it nearly kills me.</font>

937
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

938
00:44:47,438 --> 00:44:48,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting late.</font>

939
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:05,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Si?</font>

940
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

941
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:08,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

942
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

943
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,483
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dear Blue,</i></font>

944
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:36,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so one of my friends
likes the other,</i></font>

945
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,588
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and he has no idea.
I guess we all have secrets.</i></font>

946
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:42,724
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Anyway, I've been
thinking about</i></font>

947
00:45:42,793 --> 00:45:44,193
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>why I haven't come out yet.</i></font>

948
00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:46,561
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Maybe it's because
it doesn't seem fair</i></font>

949
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:48,697
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that only gay people
have to come out.</i></font>

950
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:50,199
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why is straight the default?</i></font>

951
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:52,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something
I need to tell you.</font>

952
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, there's something
I have to tell you.</font>

953
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:56,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we talk?</font>

954
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:57,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

955
00:45:58,076 --> 00:45:58,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm straight.</font>

956
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm straight.</font>

957
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:01,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.</font>

958
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like girls.</font>

959
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:06,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like men.</font>

960
00:46:06,983 --> 00:46:08,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get that
from your daddy's side.</font>

961
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in love with Nick.</font>

962
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:14,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like I've been raising
a stranger.</font>

963
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:16,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, absolutely, you have.</font>

964
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm heterosexual.</font>

965
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:20,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Help me, Jesus. Please.</font>

966
00:46:20,795 --> 00:46:22,563
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Or maybe it's because
I can't be sure</i></font>

967
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:24,431
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>this whole "being gay" thing
is forever.</i></font>

968
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:26,135
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Or maybe it's that there's
not that much</i></font>

969
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,202
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>of high school left</i></font>

970
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:28,481
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and part of me

971
00:46:28,505 --> 00:46:30,804
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>who I've always been
just a little longer.</i></font>

972
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,208
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then, when I go to college
in Los Angeles,</i></font>

973
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll be gay and proud,
I promise.</i></font>

974
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe not that gay.</font>

975
00:47:30,498 --> 00:47:31,978
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm not sure
who I'm promising.</i></font>

976
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,668
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll keep ruminating.</i></font>

977
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:35,204
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Love, Jacques.</i></font>

978
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:45,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

979
00:47:49,552 --> 00:47:51,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yeah,
after swimming with dolphins,</font>

980
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:53,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">we fly to Saint Martin
for New Year's.</font>

981
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody else,
Christmas in the Caribbean?</font>

982
00:47:56,826 --> 00:47:57,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Staying here.</font>

983
00:47:57,628 --> 00:47:59,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a classic
Spier tradition</font>

984
00:47:59,594 --> 00:48:01,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">of French toast
on Christmas Eve.</font>

985
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:03,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to an unheated
vacation house</font>

986
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the middle of nowhere.</font>

987
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:06,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">As is our bleak
family tradition.</font>

988
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:09,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! Ow!</font>

989
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:11,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man. Oh.</font>

990
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:12,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

991
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, that's a paper cut.</font>

992
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:16,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Overdramatic.</font>

993
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Simon, do you know
where the bandages are?</font>

994
00:48:20,548 --> 00:48:22,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. They're just
in the supply closet.</font>

995
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:24,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, do you mind showing me?</font>

996
00:48:27,757 --> 00:48:28,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be right back.</font>

997
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like a nurse, this man.</font>

998
00:48:32,797 --> 00:48:34,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I don't actually have
a paper cut.</font>

999
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:36,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that, Martin.
You're a very bad actor.</font>

1000
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:38,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you think this is funny?</font>

1001
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon, look,
I don't wanna have to</font>

1002
00:48:42,438 --> 00:48:44,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">leak your emails, all right?
But I will.</font>

1003
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you cannot
bring Blue into this, okay?</font>

1004
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he found out
that my emails got leaked,</font>

1005
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:50,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd get totally freaked,
all right?</font>

1006
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd never talk to me again.</font>

1007
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:52,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, probably not, you know?</font>

1008
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Internet's a freaky place
to meet people.</font>

1009
00:48:55,085 --> 00:48:56,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yo.
- Hey!</font>

1010
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:57,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1011
00:48:57,487 --> 00:48:58,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fun movie! Freak.
- <i>Freaky Friday.</i></font>

1012
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a fun movie!
- Freaky, freak, freaky.</font>

1013
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:03,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, freaky-deaky Dutch!</font>

1014
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are weird.</font>

1015
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:07,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a Band-Aid.
Those programs are a bitch.</font>

1016
00:49:09,898 --> 00:49:12,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm, yo. Martin was having
trouble running his lines</font>

1017
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:13,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we were thinking
we could go</font>

1018
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:16,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Waffle House
and go over 'em.</font>

1019
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:18,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

1020
00:49:18,442 --> 00:49:19,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be great.</font>

1021
00:49:20,074 --> 00:49:21,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm insky.</font>

1022
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good work, Spier.
- Go to hell, Martin.</font>

1023
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:37,025
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jacques,
if I were a betting man,</i></font>

1024
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:38,469
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'd say you were
drunk emailing me</i></font>

1025
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:39,494
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>during that last letter.</i></font>

1026
00:49:39,596 --> 00:49:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't worry. I liked it.</i></font>

1027
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:43,532
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As for coming out,
I know what you mean</i></font>

1028
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,958
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>about wanting to wait
till college.</i></font>

1029
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But our emails
have inspired me.</i></font>

1030

1032

00:50:10,326 --> 00:50:11,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1034
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:14,262

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

1038
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:23,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I get you?</font>

1039
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:26,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lyle! You guys know Lyle?
We have Latin together.</font>

1040
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:27,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.</font>

1041
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:28,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. How's it going?</font>

1042
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, we had Bio together
last year?</font>

1043
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:33,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, really?
- It's Simon, right?</font>

1044
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:36,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I don't, um...</font>

1045
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:38,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
It was like a big class,</font>

1046
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:39,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have a good memory
for faces.</font>

1047
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:42,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I get you guys?</font>

1048
00:50:42,391 --> 00:50:44,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we plan
on being here for a while.</font>

1049
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:47,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we're gonna start off small
and go larger.</font>

1050
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:51,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably get some bacon first,
some sausage. I'd say...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>"You're right. I'm much
too strange and extraordinary.</i></font>

1052
00:50:55,336 --> 00:50:57,938

1053
00:50:58,275 --> 00:50:59,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

1054
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you never did any acting
at your old school?</font>

1055
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Can we get back to...</font>

1056
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:06,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet,
you're from D.C., right?</font>

1057
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:08,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Can you give me
my next cue, though?</font>

1058
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:09,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why
did you move here?</font>

1059
00:51:10,552 --> 00:51:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because my parents got divorced</font>

1060
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my aunt found us
an apartment in her building.</font>

1061
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:15,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd they get divorced?</font>

1062
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does it matter, Martin?</font>

1063
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you writing a book
about girls</font>

1064
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:19,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">from a broken home in D.C.?</font>

1065
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:21,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

1066
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that my dad</font>

1067
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:28,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the greatest person
on the planet.</font>

1068
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:33,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it turns out that he's
just a sad, tired loser</font>

1069
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:35,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">who hates his job,
drinks way too much beer,</font>

1070
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">and cheats on his wife.</font>

1071
00:51:37,646 --> 00:51:40,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make up for all the stuff
that I just mentioned, so...</font>

1072
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:41,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

1073
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:43,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1074
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserve the father
that you thought you had.</font>

1075
00:51:48,224 --> 00:51:49,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, Abby?</font>

1076
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:53,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You deserve
a goddamn superhero.</font>

1077
00:51:53,963 --> 00:51:56,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thank you.
Let's get back to the...</font>

1078
00:51:56,797 --> 00:51:57,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it.</font>

1079
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:00,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1080
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:02,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna hear you say</font>

1081

1084
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, um...</font>

1085
00:52:14,784 --> 00:52:16,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't stop until you say it.</font>

1086
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:18,418

- Martin.</font>

1090
00:52:24,393 --> 00:52:26,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would just like to say
that Abby Susso here</font>

1091

1104
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:01,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you can all go back
to your meals. Thank you.</font>

that identifying leaves test?</font>

ate that poison ivy.</font>

it was pot.</font>

extra pens in his backpack?</font>

he's just waiting for the day</font>

to ask him for a pen?</font>

1122

<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he can be that guy

don't you, Simon?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not surprised?</font>

1185
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:22,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me
to be surprised?</font>

1186
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:24,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

00:57:26,195 --> 00:57:27,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:55,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, just being safe.
- Yeah.</font>

it goes okay with your dad.</i></font>

1195

you inspired me.</i></font>

to my friend tonight.</i></font>

1197
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:19,880

done that without you.</i></font>

1198
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:21,916
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Maybe we should ride
this bravery train</i></font>

1199
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:23,518

Love, Jacques.</i></font>

1210
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:09,440

1211
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,907

you were coming near.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
what day it is?</font>

1214
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,844

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1216
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:17,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm being loved,
right? Right?</font>

1217
00:59:18,072 --> 00:59:19,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1218

when you get black and Jewish?</font>

1219
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:22,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?

1220
00:59:22,943 --> 00:59:24,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's mean.</font>

1221
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:25,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon?</font>

1222
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:27,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when does Abby find
Martin so goddamn funny?</font>

1223
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's crazy.</font>

1224
00:59:29,885 --> 00:59:31,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
this is stupid.</font>

1225
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna tell her
that I like her.</font>

1226
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:33,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been thinking</font>

1227
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">the whole
sexual experience thing,</font>

1228
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:36,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not that big of a deal.</font>

1229
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:37,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, actually,
I've been practicing, right?</font>

1230
00:59:37,793 --> 00:59:38,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this thing online.</font>

1231
00:59:39,028 --> 00:59:40,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really cool.
It's called a pocket puss...</font>

00:59:40,063 --> 00:59:41,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abby likes Martin.</font>

1233
00:59:42,364 --> 00:59:43,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me herself.</font>

1234
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But he's Martin.
- I know.</font>

1235
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:48,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't care.</font>

1236
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:49,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna try.
- Hey, wait, wait.</font>

1237
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Leah?</font>

1238
00:59:51,974 --> 00:59:53,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Leah?</font>

1239
00:59:53,909 --> 00:59:55,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude.</font>

1240
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:59,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leah's in love with you.
- No, she's not.</font>

1241
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:00,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?</font>

1242
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, come on.
The way she looks at you</font>

1243
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:04,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how she's been all jealous
ever since Abby's been around?</font>

1244
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she blushes every time
you come into the room.</font>

1245
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:10,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you and Abby...</font>

1246
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:12,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's never gonna happen.</font>

1247
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:14,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you and Leah...</font>

1248
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:17,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you could be
incredible together.</font>

1249
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- What's up?</font>

1250
01:00:31,347 --> 01:00:33,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I have something
to tell you.</font>

1251
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick just asked me
to get dinner</font>

1252
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:37,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the homecoming game.</font>

1253
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:40,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1254
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, like, Si, he was like...</font>

1255
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came up to me
and he's like,</font>

1256
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:45,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Do you wanna go get dinner?"</font>

1257
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, and I was like,</font>

1258
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:48,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sure, are Abby and Simon in?"
And he was like</font>

1259
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I was thinking it could just be
the two of us. Like, a date."</font>

1260
01:00:53,034 --> 01:00:54,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's amazing.</font>

1261
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:56,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is?</font>

1262
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:58,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1263
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:01,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leah, come on.</font>

1264
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:05,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're into him.</font>

1265
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:06,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1266
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that stuff
that you were talking</font>

1267
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:09,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the night
after Bram's party,</font>

1268
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">about, you know,
being so into one person</font>

1269
01:01:12,721 --> 01:01:14,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it almost kills you.</font>

1270
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:17,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were talking about Nick.</font>

1271
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:20,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

1272
01:01:21,195 --> 01:01:23,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you think
I should go out with him?</font>

1273
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes.</font>

1274
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1275
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:31,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Yeah!</font>

1276
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise you,
you're not gonna regret it.</font>

1277
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:34,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be great!</font>

1278
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pull out
your claws, Grizzlies!</font>

1279
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:44,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1280
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:52,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon, that Almont QB
is insanely hot.</font>

1281
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can talk about stuff
like this now, you know.</font>

1282
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:56,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I still don't know</font>

1283
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:57,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I really quite
figured out how.</font>

1284
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:01,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seriously?
- Yeah.</font>

1285
01:02:01,902 --> 01:02:04,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta practice.
All right. Simon.</font>

1286
01:02:05,072 --> 01:02:06,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Do you think</font>

1287
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:11,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">that quarterback is lookin'
fine in those hot pants?</font>

1288
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:13,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lookin' pretty fine.</font>

1289
01:02:15,851 --> 01:02:18,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. No.</font>

1290
01:02:18,452 --> 01:02:22,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine! Good.
Put your body into it.</font>

1291
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:23,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine!</font>

1292
01:02:24,226 --> 01:02:25,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was really good.</font>

1293
01:02:25,226 --> 01:02:26,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was so good.

1294
01:02:26,695 --> 01:02:28,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, check it out.
It's the Waffle House guy.</font>

1295
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:31,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

1296
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:33,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

1297
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lyle?
- I don't know. Could be.</font>

1298
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- Do you think he's...</font>

1299
01:02:39,074 --> 01:02:40,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1300
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:42,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well,
you should talk to him.</font>

1301
01:02:42,644 --> 01:02:43,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get a coffee.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

1305
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:52,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. If it isn't
my favorite waiter.</font>

1306
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:55,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, there he is.
The guy who sees everything.</font>

1307
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:56,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1308
01:02:57,324 --> 01:02:59,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I wouldn't have taken you
for a homecoming guy.</font>

1309
01:02:59,226 --> 01:03:00,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just here for the coffee.</font>

1310
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:03,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Yeah, it's all
about the cappuccinos</font>

1311
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:04,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">and camaraderie for this guy.</font>

1312
01:03:10,905 --> 01:03:11,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're here.</font>

1313
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:14,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are?</font>

1314
01:03:14,775 --> 01:03:15,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1315
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:18,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause I wanted to
ask you something.</font>

1316
01:03:20,081 --> 01:03:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna ask you
the other day</font>

1317
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:23,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I was, like,
too chickenshit.</font>

1318
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's Abby's deal?</font>

1319
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you and her
hang out a lot.</font>

1320
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the two of you
like a thing, or...</font>

1321

<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1322
01:03:35,262 --> 01:03:37,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, uh, we're just friends.</font>

1323
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never be just friends
with someone that hot.</font>

1324
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:40,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

1325
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:41,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day is a struggle.</font>

1326
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:45,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go. I'll see ya.</font>

1327

you're into bears!</font>

1329
01:03:58,186 --> 01:03:59,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude! It's me!</font>

1330

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Si, have you read it?</i></font>

1480
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:34,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't talk right now.</font>

1481
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:36,336
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- No. Si, wait!</i>
- I gotta go.</font>

1482
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:38,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Si?</font>

1483
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:40,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it.</font>

1484
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:43,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already reported it.
They're gonna take it down.</font>

1485
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:44,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late.
No, there's people</font>

1486
01:12:44,712 --> 01:12:46,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">who've already seen it, so...</font>

1487
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:47,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">it doesn't really matter.</font>

1488
01:12:49,551 --> 01:12:50,652

1490
01:12:55,554 --> 01:12:56,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

1491
01:12:57,224 --> 01:12:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what are you gonna do?</font>

1492
01:12:59,693 --> 01:13:00,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1493
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could deny it.</font>

1494
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:04,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the hell
would I deny it, Nora?</font>

1495
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:06,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not ashamed of it.</font>

1496
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've just never really
said anything.</font>

1497
01:13:09,002 --> 01:13:09,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?</font>

1498
01:13:09,935 --> 01:13:11,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that have to do
with anything?</font>

1499
01:13:11,072 --> 01:13:12,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
are you talking about?</font>

1500
01:13:12,572 --> 01:13:13,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1501

who I am.</i></font>

1505
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:27,854
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And someone posted our emails.</i></font>

1506
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Please don't freak out.
Please, Blue.</i></font>

1507

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I need you to promise me
you won't disappear.</i></font>

1508
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:10,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mum,
let me open my present.</font>

1509
01:14:10,496 --> 01:14:13,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, I'm trying to
tell you you need to shave.</font>

1510
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that mean
you're gonna keep cooking?</font>

1511
01:14:15,435 --> 01:14:17,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course. I can
make dinner tonight, too.</font>

1512
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:18,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Awesome.
- What's this for?</font>

1513
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:19,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1514
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:21,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one, Sherlock.
There you go.</font>

1515
01:14:27,246 --> 01:14:28,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

1516
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:30,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bluetooth headphones.</font>

1517
01:14:31,018 --> 01:14:32,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you like the black?
- Oh, I love it.</font>

1518
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I didn't
know if you liked...</font>

1519
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is great.</font>

1520
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:36,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They have other colors.
- He said he likes it.</font>

1521
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:38,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I love it.
- Okay. I have the receipt.</font>

1522
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:39,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's good.</font>

1523
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:48,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I did want to talk
to you guys about something.</font>

1524
01:14:50,135 --> 01:14:51,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

1525
01:14:53,139 --> 01:14:54,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, well...</font>

1526
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess...</font>

1527
01:14:57,011 --> 01:14:58,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">you got somebody pregnant.</font>

1528
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:00,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're pregnant.</font>

1529
01:15:01,015 --> 01:15:03,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Yeah, I'm pregnant.
I knew it.</font>

1530
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got that glow about him,
baby.</font>

1531
01:15:04,752 --> 01:15:05,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey.</font>

1532
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:06,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Uh...</font>

1533
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gay.</font>

1534
01:15:16,296 --> 01:15:17,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey.</font>

1535
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't want you guys to
think anything different.</font>

1536
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still me.</font>

1537
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you are.</font>

1538
01:15:25,337 --> 01:15:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Simon.
- Yeah.</font>

1539
01:15:27,742 --> 01:15:28,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're gay?</font>

1540
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one of your
old girlfriends turned ya?</font>

1541
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it the one
with the big eyebrow...</font>

1542
01:15:33,146 --> 01:15:34,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jack.

1543
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, can you ever
shut the hell up?</font>

1544
01:15:35,849 --> 01:15:36,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm kidding.</font>

1545
01:15:36,884 --> 01:15:38,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not funny.
- I'm kidding, Nora.</font>

1546
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:40,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just open up your gift. Please.</font>

1547
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:46,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, honey.</font>

1548
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:47,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nora, I got you this.
- Simon.</font>

1549
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's for you.
No, that's for you.</font>

1550
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:50,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's from me.</font>

1551
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:56,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Cuisinart.</font>

1552
01:15:58,103 --> 01:15:59,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it. Thank you, Simon.</font>

1555
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:10,382

1567
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:35,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

1568
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:36,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Si.</font>

1569
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:39,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come sit down.</font>

1570
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:43,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be late.</font>

1571
01:17:15,314 --> 01:17:16,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

1572
01:17:16,748 --> 01:17:18,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Simon, we need to talk.</font>

1573
01:17:18,952 --> 01:17:21,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Abby and I hung out
on New Year's Eve, and...</font>

1574
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">you see, now we're together.</font>

1575
01:17:24,024 --> 01:17:25,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome. That's great.</font>

1576
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:27,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it is.</font>

1577
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then we got to talking
about why it took so long.</font>

1578
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you tell Nick
that I have</font>

1579
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:33,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">a boyfriend in college
named Jonathan?</font>

1580
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:35,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why'd you make that up?
- Look, Martin...</font>

1581
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">he was the one who wrote</font>

1582
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">that <i>CreekSecrets</i> post
about me.</font>

1583
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">He screenshotted my emails</font>

1584
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:43,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's been using them
to blackmail me for months.</font>

1585
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:46,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that have to do
with us, Simon?</font>

1586
01:17:47,012 --> 01:17:48,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me
that if I didn't help him</font>

1587
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:50,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">get with Abby, he'd out me.</font>

1588
01:17:53,284 --> 01:17:54,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I...</font>

1589
01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:56,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I had to
keep you guys apart.</font>

1590
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you made up a bunch of lies.</font>

1591
01:17:59,894 --> 01:18:00,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why
you convinced me</font>

1592
01:18:00,895 --> 01:18:02,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go on that date with Leah?</font>

1593
01:18:02,362 --> 01:18:03,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, to keep me away
from Abby?</font>

1594
01:18:03,965 --> 01:18:05,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, wait. Running lines
at Waffle House</font>

1595
01:18:06,032 --> 01:18:07,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">and beer pong at Bram's,</font>

1596
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of that was just to
pawn me off on Martin?</font>

1597
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:12,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not
a piece of meat, Simon.</font>

1598
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:15,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how hard it was
for me to start over.</font>

1599
01:18:17,743 --> 01:18:19,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trusted you.</font>

1600
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, come on, Leah.
I'll take you to school.</font>

1601
01:18:31,157 --> 01:18:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leah. Leah, please.
Listen, listen.</font>

1602
01:18:34,059 --> 01:18:35,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I messed up, okay?</font>

1603
01:18:35,395 --> 01:18:36,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I knew you were
in love with Nick.</font>

1604
01:18:36,896 --> 01:18:38,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I thought that maybe...
- Just stop it!</font>

1605
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? You are
insanely stupid, Simon.</font>

1606
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:44,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never in love with Nick.
I was in love with you!</font>

1607
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look...</font>

1608
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're... We're us.</font>

1609
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:53,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well...</font>

1610
01:18:54,047 --> 01:18:56,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1611
01:18:58,315 --> 01:18:59,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been trying to tell you.</font>

1612
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:05,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">That night I slept over,
I was trying to tell you.</font>

1613
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna know
the funniest part?</font>

1614
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:12,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that all these years, you
being so picky with girls,</font>

1615
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:15,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that maybe it was</font>

1616
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:17,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you might
like me, too.</font>

1617
01:19:17,936 --> 01:19:19,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, you know,
you told me</font>

1618
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:20,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go out with Nick</font>

1619
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:23,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I realized you were just
never gonna see me that way.</font>

1620
01:19:23,908 --> 01:19:26,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can deal with you
being gay, Si.</font>

1621
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:28,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you set me up
to get my heart broken</font>

1622
01:19:28,582 --> 01:19:30,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you thought
I was in love with Nick</font>

1623
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:31,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that just makes you cruel.</font>

1624
01:20:01,648 --> 01:20:02,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

1625
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:03,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hanging in there.</font>

1626
01:20:04,284 --> 01:20:06,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, for the record,</font>

1627
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:08,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was saying that we have
a lot in common, you know,</font>

1628
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:11,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't really... That's not
what I was talking about.</font>

1629
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotcha.</font>

1630
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:14,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just FYI, just for the record.</font>

1631
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:16,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, great. Thanks.
- All right.</font>

1632
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jackie.</font>

1633
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:29,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you date me</font>

1634
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:30,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you think
I look like a guy?</font>

1635
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:33,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, I actually
broke up with you</font>

1636
01:20:33,546 --> 01:20:35,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you don't look
like a guy.</font>

1637
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh, okay. Thanks.</font>

1638
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:40,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome.</font>

1639
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:57,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah! Hey, Creekwood!</font>

1640
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:01,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one's for you, Spier.</font>

1641
01:21:02,841 --> 01:21:03,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ethan.</font>

1642
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1643
01:21:10,048 --> 01:21:11,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, ooh, ooh.</font>

1644
01:21:11,652 --> 01:21:13,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like that,
don't you, Spier?</font>

1645
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:17,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, Ethan, Simon likey.</font>

1646
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:23,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have something
you wanna say to me?</font>

1647
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:26,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said do you have something
to say to me?</font>

1648
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll take it from here.
- Hey, Ms. Albright.</font>

1649
01:21:30,068 --> 01:21:31,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't "Hey, Ms. Albright" me.</font>

1650
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:32,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not friends.
You're not gonna</font>

1651
01:21:32,538 --> 01:21:34,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">braid my hair
or paint my nails.</font>

1652
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:35,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your ass
off the table now!</font>

1653
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sweaty, hormonal virgins.</font>

1654
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:40,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? You're about to
be suspended for so long,</font>

1655
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">that by the time it's over,
you're gonna be</font>

1656
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:44,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fat, bald, unhappily married</font>

1657
01:21:44,952 --> 01:21:48,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">wildly mediocre nobodies
you're destined to become.</font>

1658
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't talk to us like that.</font>

1659
01:21:50,023 --> 01:21:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I can,
'cause I just did.</font>

1660
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know why?
Because you're just those two</font>

1661
01:21:53,426 --> 01:21:54,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">assholes that did
that shitty thing</font>

1662
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:57,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">in front of the whole school.
And guess what?</font>

1663
01:21:57,962 --> 01:22:01,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody feels sorry for those
assholes, especially me.</font>

1664
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:03,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, walk.
Mr. Worth's office now.</font>

1665
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

1666
01:22:05,872 --> 01:22:07,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-uh. That's mine now.</font>

1667
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'mma sell it.
Get my tubes tied.</font>

1668
01:22:26,324 --> 01:22:28,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does Mr. Worth
have to talk to us?</font>

1669
01:22:29,493 --> 01:22:31,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, can't we just
let this shit go?</font>

1670
01:22:34,902 --> 01:22:36,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I'm sorry, Ethan.</font>

1671
01:22:38,505 --> 01:22:40,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of this ever happened
when just you were out.</font>

1672
01:22:42,672 --> 01:22:44,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what they say,
one gay's a snooze,</font>

1673
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:46,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">two's a hilarious hate crime.</font>

1674
01:22:51,617 --> 01:22:53,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could've told me
you were gay.</font>

1675
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I didn't think
we had very much in common.</font>

1676
01:22:57,724 --> 01:22:59,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me, Simon.</font>

1677
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:01,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like
your all-hoodie wardrobe</font>

1678
01:23:01,659 --> 01:23:02,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">rocks my world.</font>

1679
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:10,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1680
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:12,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I was jealous.</font>

1681
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been out
since you were 16.</font>

1682
01:23:17,309 --> 01:23:19,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">It always seemed
so easy for you.</font>

1683
01:23:19,278 --> 01:23:20,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy?</font>

1684
01:23:21,113 --> 01:23:22,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you kidding me?</font>

1685
01:23:25,085 --> 01:23:26,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mom still tells
my grandparents</font>

1686
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:28,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">about all the girls I'm dating</font>

1687
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we go over to their house
for dinner, every Sunday.</font>

1688
01:23:32,292 --> 01:23:34,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">She says it's 'cause
they're old and religious,</font>

1689
01:23:35,194 --> 01:23:36,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's just easier that way.</font>

1690
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:39,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know,
maybe that's true.</font>

1691
01:23:40,564 --> 01:23:43,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you should hear her voice
when she talks about the girls.</font>

1692
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, boys, come on in.</font>

1693
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:52,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1694
01:23:54,212 --> 01:23:55,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
just stand right here.</font>

1695
01:23:58,216 --> 01:23:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

1696
01:24:02,653 --> 01:24:04,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, these gentlemen
have something</font>

1697
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they would like
to say to you.</font>

1698
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're sorry.
- Our bad.</font>

1699
01:24:07,524 --> 01:24:09,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.
'Cause at Creekwood High,</font>

1700
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:10,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do we believe in?</font>

1701
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tolerance.</font>

1702
01:24:11,662 --> 01:24:13,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And "tolerance" means
we respect</font>

1703
01:24:13,864 --> 01:24:15,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon and Ethan's choice
to be boyfriends.</font>

1704
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are not boyfriends.
- Yeah. No.</font>

1705
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:19,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, whatever you wanna
call it,</font>

1706
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:20,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's fine with me. Seriously.</font>

1707
01:24:20,573 --> 01:24:22,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call it "two people</font>

1708
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">that are not at all
romantically involved."</font>

1709
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:26,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I get it.
Keepin' it casual, man.</font>

1710
01:24:26,045 --> 01:24:27,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can dig, seriously.</font>

1711
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:31,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Simon. Hey, can we talk?</font>

1712
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have anything
to say to you.</font>

1713
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:35,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please.
I just wanted to say</font>

1714
01:24:35,485 --> 01:24:36,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I was sorry, okay?</font>

1715
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know or think</font>

1716
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:39,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">that people still did
shit like that.</font>

1717
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:41,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got in a lot of shit
for Homecoming,</font>

1718
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:43,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I wanted everyone to focus
on something else, you know?</font>

1719
01:24:43,761 --> 01:24:45,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't think
it was gonna be a big thing.</font>

1720
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:47,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if you didn't
think that my coming out</font>

1721
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">was gonna be
a big thing, Martin.</font>

1722
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:51,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you don't get to
decide that.</font>

1723
01:24:51,735 --> 01:24:54,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to be the one
that decides when</font>

1724
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">and where,
and how and who knows</font>

1725
01:24:55,942 --> 01:24:56,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how I get to say it.</font>

1726
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's supposed to be
my thing!</font>

1727
01:24:58,475 --> 01:25:00,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you took that away
from me.</font>

1728
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:03,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, well, can you please just
get the fuck away from me?</font>

1729
01:25:35,948 --> 01:25:39,016
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I saw the posts.
I know who you are.</i></font>

1730
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:40,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jacques a Dit.</font>

1731
01:25:41,021 --> 01:25:43,088
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's what they call
Simon Says in France.</i></font>

1732
01:25:43,454 --> 01:25:44,454
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Very clever.</i></font>

1733
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,457
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm sorry, Simon.
I can't do this anymore.</i></font>

1734
01:25:47,525 --> 01:25:49,359
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Please, Blue.
- I'm so sorry.</i></font>

1735
01:25:49,662 --> 01:25:52,463
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You can't leave me alone.
Everything's falling apart.</i></font>

1736
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I haven't even
talked to her.</font>

1737
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't even
seen her at school.</font>

1738
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:51,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I guess
I'll see you in class, right?</font>

1739
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:52,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.</font>

1740
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:53,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later.</font>

1741
01:26:54,962 --> 01:26:56,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey, Simon.</font>

1742
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:00,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it you?</font>

1743
01:27:02,534 --> 01:27:03,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Blue?</font>

1744
01:27:04,502 --> 01:27:07,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, it's not me. Sorry.</font>

1745
01:27:11,377 --> 01:27:13,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've had
a crazy couple days.</font>

1746
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:14,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna talk about it?</font>

1747
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:16,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.</font>

1748
01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:18,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't worry.
- Sorry for bothering you.</font>

1749
01:27:59,891 --> 01:28:00,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know?</font>

1750
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:08,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew you had a secret.</font>

1751
01:28:13,172 --> 01:28:15,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, when you were little,
you were so carefree.</font>

1752
01:28:17,176 --> 01:28:21,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But these last few years,
more and more...</font>

1753
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:25,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's almost like I could
feel you holding your breath.</font>

1754
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to ask you
about it, but I...</font>

1755
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't wanna pry.</font>

1756
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:44,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe I made a mistake.
- No. No, Mom, you...</font>

1757
01:28:46,604 --> 01:28:47,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't make a mistake.</font>

1758
01:28:52,376 --> 01:28:54,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being gay is your thing.</font>

1759
01:28:55,212 --> 01:28:58,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are parts of it
you have to go through alone.</font>

1760
01:28:58,918 --> 01:28:59,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate that.</font>

1761
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:04,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as you came out,
you said, "Mom, I'm still me."</font>

1762
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:09,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to hear this.</font>

1763
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:14,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are still you, Simon.</font>

1764
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:21,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are still the same son
who I love to tease,</font>

1765
01:29:22,305 --> 01:29:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and who your father depends on
for just about everything.</font>

1766
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:27,877

<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a couple...
How much is it?</font>

1961
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:05,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's four tickets, four bucks.

- Wait, wait.</font>

1968
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I sit there?</font>

1969
01:41:25,363 --> 01:41:26,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was kind of waiting
for somebody.</font>

1970
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know.</font>

1971

1974
01:41:48,586 --> 01:41:50,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that night at the party...</font>

1975
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:53,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
I was drunk and confused.</font>

1976
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:55,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it ended, like,
a minute after you saw us.</font>

1979
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:04,101

1982
01:42:10,175 --> 01:42:11,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of crazy, huh?</font>

1983
01:42:11,408 --> 01:42:12,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think you'd come.</font>

1984
01:42:13,844 --> 01:42:14,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me neither.</font>

1985
01:42:15,113 --> 01:42:18,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until I was walking towards you,
I didn't think I had it in me.</font>

01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:40,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you disappointed
that it's me?</font>
