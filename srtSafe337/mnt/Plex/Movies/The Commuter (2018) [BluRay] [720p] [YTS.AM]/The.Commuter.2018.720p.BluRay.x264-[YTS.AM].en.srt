00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:12,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a ticket?</font>

297
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:14,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a goddamn shame.</font>

298
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut your mouth. Of course
I know what I'm talking about.</font>

299
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many years have I been
doing this? Tell me.</font>

300
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind?</font>

301
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mind your 99-cent perfume.</font>

302
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tickets, guys.
- No, now I'm talking to you.</font>

303
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:26,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

304
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on. Bye-bye.</font>

305
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead. Send it through.</font>

306
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking
at the numbers now.</font>

307
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,837
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now arriving
68th Street Station.</i></font>

308
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,491
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now leaving
68th Street Station.</i></font>

309
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,864
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Next stop,
86th Street Station.</i></font>

310
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steinbeck, huh?</font>

311
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say his greatest work</font>

312
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a letter
he wrote to his son.</font>

313
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your book.
- Right.</font>

314
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon.</font>

315
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:35,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

316
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my first time
on a commuter train.</font>

317
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:45,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's eclectic.</font>

318
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about you?
- Every day. Last 10 years.</font>

319
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:50,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten years?</font>

320
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must know
everyone on this train.</font>

321
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">The regular commuters,
I guess. Faces mostly.</font>

322
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No. I'm Joanna.</font>

323
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:02,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Michael.
- Michael.</font>

324
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long is it between stops?
Four minutes?</font>

325
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:10,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, give or take.</font>

326
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four minutes.
On and off, on and off.</font>

327
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so miscellaneous.</font>

328
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm bothering you, aren't I?
- No.</font>

329
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:20,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.
You just wanna read your book.</font>

330
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:27,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... I'm married.</font>

331
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I... Me, too.</font>

332
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry.
- I study human behavior.</font>

333
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's an occupational hazard.
- Being married?</font>

334
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, bothering people.
- Oh.</font>

335
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a conversationalist.</font>

336
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, in your job, you sit down,</font>

337
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">strike up a conversation.
Then what?</font>

338
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's say there are
100 people in this car.</font>

339
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are
16 personality types,</font>

340
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:55,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">as defined by psychology.</font>

341
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so I can assume
that there are about</font>

342
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">six people of each type,</font>

343
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">with varying
degrees of response</font>

344
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:02,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">to any particular situation.</font>

345
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:06,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">My job is to answer
one basic question.</font>

346
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- What kind of person are you?</font>

347
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:12,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? You should
probably ask my wife.</font>

348
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do an experiment.
- Experiment?</font>

349
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:19,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's painless.</font>

350
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:21,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a simple
hypothetical question.</font>

351
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

352
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:33,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I asked you
to do one little thing?</font>

353
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:39,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's something that you are
uniquely qualified to do.</font>

354
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's something
that's meaningless to you,</font>

355
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:45,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it could profoundly affect
an individual on this train.</font>

356
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:48,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you do it?</font>

357
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd want to know
what kind of thing.</font>

358
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm-hmm. Does it matter?
- Well, I think it does.</font>

359
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:54,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you would never know</font>

360
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:55,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">the consequences
of what you did.</font>

361
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why would I do it?</font>

362
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:02,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there
would be a reward.</font>

363
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">A-ha.</font>

364
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:10,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, uh... What's the reward?</font>

365
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the bathroom, carriage two,</font>

366
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:23,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe there is a package.
It's hidden,</font>

367
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:29,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">and inside that package
is $25,000.</font>

368
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:33,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">That money is yours,
plus another 75 cash,</font>

369
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:37,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you do
this one little thing.</font>

370
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:39,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

371
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:44,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone on this train
does not belong.</font>

372
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:47,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do
is find them. That's it.</font>

373
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:51,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">This person is carrying a bag.</font>

374
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:52,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
what it looks like.</font>

375
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">But inside that bag
is something they have stolen.</font>

376
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">This person goes
by the name of Prynne.</font>

377
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a real name.</font>

378
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be on this train
until Cold Spring.</font>

379
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find them,
you find the bag,</font>

380
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">that $100,000 is yours.</font>

381
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't leave the train
before finding the bag.</font>

382
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:19,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell anyone
about this offer.</font>

383
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:20,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</font>

384
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:21,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple.</font>

385
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought
this was hypothetical.</font>

386
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:25,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just one little thing.</font>

387
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:28,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shouldn't be too hard
for an ex-cop.</font>

388
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:29,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait.
<i>- Arriving at...</i></font>

389
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:30,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did you know...
- <i>... 86th Street Station.</i></font>

390
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, that's me.
- You're being serious, right?</font>

391
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have until
the next stop to decide.</font>

392
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of person are you?</font>

86th Street Station.</i></font>

394
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

395
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:28,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kidding me.</font>

396
00:23:56,747 --> 00:23:58,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tickets, anybody? Ticket?</font>

397
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:30,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

398
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:31,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna
wanna move on, pal.</font>

399
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:32,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">The AC's out in here.</font>

400
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I was hoping
you could help me.</font>

401
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for someone.
A friend.</font>

402
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

403
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:40,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to Cold Spring,</font>

404
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:43,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I was wondering
if you keep track</font>

405
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">of where everyone
gets on and off the train.</font>

406
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:49,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I take pictures,
I hand out surveys, you know.</font>

407
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean it like that.</font>

408
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, it's tickets
and zones, okay?</font>

409
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:54,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">They buy a ticket
for a station,</font>

410
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:58,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I punch the zone stub
and put it on the seat. Boom.</font>

411
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:03,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that just day riders or...</font>

412
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:05,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you're looking
for your friend, right?</font>

413
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

414
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
what they look like?</font>

415
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're asking me questions</font>

416
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:12,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">about passengers,
about protocol?</font>

417
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, it's stupid.
We only talked online.</font>

418
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said she'd be here.
Lives in Cold Spring.</font>

421
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:30,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I can't help you, pal.
No one can.</font>

422
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- All right.</font>

423
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,378

00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:33,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not a cop.</font>

590
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:35,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, listen,
if he really cared about you,</font>

591
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wouldn't ask you
to do something like this.</font>

592
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:41,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

596
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's nothing.</font>

597
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:16,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, they were all sitting
together, three of them.</font>

598
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,137

- At 125th they split up,</font>

600
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:22,007

I ride this line every day.</font>

604
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:29,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said,
maybe it's nothing,</font>

605
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,518

a look in your bag.</font>

615

Seriously, why me? Why my bag?</font>

622
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're disturbing
everybody, ma'am.</font>

623

625
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,621

631
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just open your bag.
I'm sorry, sir.</font>

632

Some guy says he's a cop.</font>

Look, it sounds crazy.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">They threatened
Karen and Danny.</font>

663

I didn't have a choice.</font>

not telling me, Murph?</font>

00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:37,523
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You have
a beautiful family, Michael.</i></font>

735
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,693
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now arriving Tarrytown.</i></font>

736
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:41,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are police
on their way right now.</font>

737
00:48:41,697 --> 00:48:42,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your men try anything...</font>

738
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:43,731
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, they were, Michael.
They were.</i></font>

739
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Until you called too much
attention to yourself.</i></font>

740
00:48:46,402 --> 00:48:48,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- <i>Look outside.</i></font>

741
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:51,103
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Someone reported a dangerous
individual on the train.</i></font>

742
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:54,541
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now you're standing over
a corpse. Do the math.</i></font>

743
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:55,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to do?</font>

744
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:58,780
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't leave the train
and don't get caught.</i></font>

745
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,306
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've been doing this
a long time.</i></font>

746
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:28,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you,
he's a regular.</font>

747
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:30,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think he's dangerous.</font>

748
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:33,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy claims he's looking
for someone on board, right?</font>

749
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:34,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">He makes up
some bullshit story</font>

750
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">about suspicious bags,</font>

751
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then he gets into a fight.</font>

752
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:30,469
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sorry for the delay, folks.</i></font>

753
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:32,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We'll be on our way very soon.</i></font>

754
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:36,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Compartments
one and two all clear.</font>

755
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:37,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Call the captain.
- Yes, sir.</font>

756
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:40,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got two and three clear.
Three and four clear.</font>

757
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Compartments
five and six clear.</font>

758
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:43,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's not here.</font>

759
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:45,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, wrap it up, boys.</font>

760
00:52:56,684 --> 00:52:57,949
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That was impressive, Michael.</i></font>

761
00:52:57,952 --> 00:52:59,686
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I almost thought
you were gonna miss the train.</i></font>

762
00:52:59,688 --> 00:53:01,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna talk
to my wife and my son.</font>

763
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:02,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know they're safe.</font>

764
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,724
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There are two more stops
before Cold Spring.</i></font>

765
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:06,458
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Garrison Station
is your last chance,</i></font>

766
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,628
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>if you ever wanna
talk to them again.</i></font>

767
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more time.
There isn't enough to go on.</font>

768
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:13,132
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You've proven
yourself capable.</i></font>

769
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:14,534
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Figure it out.</i></font>

770
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:37,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Manny, AC's cut out.</font>

771
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:39,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna check
the hub in three.</font>

772
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:40,760
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Copy that.</i>
- Hi. Excuse me.</font>

773
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's, like,
90 degrees in here.</font>

774
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:44,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, working on it, ma'am.
Working on it.</font>

775
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tarrytown.
I thought you got off.</font>

776
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam.</font>

777
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:53,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lucky son of a bitch.</font>

778
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad said it pays
to make new friends.</font>

779
00:53:58,813 --> 00:54:00,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You wanna go again?
- Yep.</font>

780
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:13,057
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed</i></font>

783
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:19,900

Thank you.</i></font>

784
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure you've noticed</font>

785
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:24,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've entered the seventh
circle of hell. God damn it.</font>

786
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna be a hell of a ride
to Cold Spring.</font>

787
00:54:58,974 --> 00:55:02,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Two pairs. Queens. Fours.</font>

788
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Tony, deal me in?
- Your money to lose, pal.</font>

789
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in, Mike.</font>

790
00:55:08,248 --> 00:55:10,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got 100 to my name.</font>

791
00:55:10,985 --> 00:55:12,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Texas hold 'em.</font>

792
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:13,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good?
- Sure.</font>

793
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:15,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Gentlemen.</font>

794
00:55:18,157 --> 00:55:19,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a peek.</font>

795
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Doing all right there, pal?
- You don't wanna know.</font>

796
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:32,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have got off
two stops ago.</font>

797
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:34,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten years I ride this train.</font>

798
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one time I wanna see
the end of the line.</font>

799
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:38,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- What about you, friend?</font>

800
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about me?</font>

801
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:43,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never seen you
on this train before.</font>

802
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:46,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've never
seen you either.</font>

803
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not a regular.
- What is that to you?</font>

804
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

805
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:55,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think your friend here's
got a problem with me.</font>

806
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Relax.
- Just making conversation.</font>

807
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all.</font>

808
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:01,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you wanna
say something,</font>

809
00:56:01,768 --> 00:56:04,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't you say it?</font>

810
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:09,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just occurred to me
that most of us,</font>

811
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:10,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">we ride this train every day.</font>

812
00:56:10,612 --> 00:56:13,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">We nod. We say hello.</font>

813
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:15,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how much do we really
know about each other?</font>

814
00:56:15,882 --> 00:56:19,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you, Mike?
What do we know about you?</font>

815
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough.</font>

816
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:22,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got fired today.</font>

817
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Didn't have the guts
to tell my wife.</font>

818
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Have to go home,
look my son in the eye.</font>

819
00:56:29,697 --> 00:56:31,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I supposed to say?</font>

820
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:34,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm not the man
you thought I was"?</font>

821
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:36,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of father?
What kind of husband?</font>

822
00:56:38,172 --> 00:56:42,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">60 years old.
What have I got left to offer?</font>

823
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was extremely honest.
- And I thought my life sucked.</font>

824
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:47,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we gonna play or what?</font>

825
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:50,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

826
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out.</font>

827
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:57,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I heard something
earlier today,</font>

828
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:59,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">- a hypothetical question.
- Uh-huh.</font>

829
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:00,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was the question?</font>

830
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:03,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if someone asked you
to do one little thing,</font>

831
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">something that's
meaningless to you,</font>

832
00:57:05,097 --> 00:57:07,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">but would affect another
passenger on this train?</font>

833
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:10,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you do it?</font>

834
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
What's in it for me?</font>

835
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:14,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">$100,000.</font>

836
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

837
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't
even know what it is.</font>

838
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:19,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter. Come on.</font>

839
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:22,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what is
that one little thing?</font>

840
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:24,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">A passenger on this train
doesn't belong.</font>

841
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:25,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're carrying a bag,</font>

842
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't know
what it looks like.</font>

843
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:28,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do</font>

844
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:31,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">is find them
before they get off.</font>

845
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:34,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?
It's not much to go on, Mike.</font>

846
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about it.</font>

847
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:37,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens
when you find 'em?</font>

848
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:40,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">They die. Hypothetically.</font>

849
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what would you do, Mike?</font>

850
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd get all the people
left on the train in one car,</font>

851
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">propose that very scenario.</font>

852
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

853
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, would you
take the money?</font>

854
00:57:54,382 --> 00:57:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? I already did.</font>

855
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You see, I count five.
- Five what?</font>

856
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:07,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five people left
that don't belong.</font>

857
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five people on this train
that I've never seen before.</font>

858
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:10,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lady right here.</font>

859
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:15,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young girl with the
pink hair at the window.</font>

860
00:58:15,936 --> 00:58:18,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Goldman Sachs over there.</font>

861
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:20,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend with the guitar.</font>

862
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you.</font>

863
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:30,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Jackson.</font>

864
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know what I would do?
- Tell me.</font>

865
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:39,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would pocket that 100 grand,</font>

866
00:58:39,027 --> 00:58:41,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">find the guy,</font>

867
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:42,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell him to
take a different train.</font>

868
00:58:46,434 --> 00:58:47,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

869
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:53,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All in.
- Whoa. Whoa.</font>

870
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:55,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">For real? All right.</font>

871
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:03,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you never
answered the question.</font>

872
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:04,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">What question?</font>

873
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing
on this train?</font>

874
00:59:06,387 --> 00:59:08,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm like you.</font>

875
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I wanna
see the end of the line.</font>

876
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:12,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. Excuse me.</font>

877
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:14,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call.</font>

878
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:17,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a monthly pass.
You're a regular commuter.</font>

879
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:22,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And I have a full house.</font>

880
00:59:22,737 --> 00:59:24,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

881
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you have?
- That's it for me.</font>

882
00:59:27,842 --> 00:59:29,344

883
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:42,824

you're talking about?</font>

884
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:45,891

885

to know what you know,</font>

887
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you're going
to Cold Spring,</font>

888
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's in that case.</font>

889
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:57,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's just a guitar.
- Open it.</font>

890
00:59:57,103 --> 00:59:59,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna help me?
Why should I trust you?</font>

891
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:00,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the case.</font>

892
01:00:18,192 --> 01:00:19,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we do now?</font>

893
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:23,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I go to carriage one,
barricade ourselves inside.</font>

894
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:25,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then, what,
you gonna find this killer,</font>

895
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">take him down yourself?</font>

896
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna try.</font>

897
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, I'm not Prynne.</font>

898
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you seem to have
figured that out already.</font>

899
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:37,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a left-handed guitar.</font>

900
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:39,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that got to do with it?</font>

901
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:42,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, are you okay?</font>

902
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

903
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:48,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gun's in your right hand.</font>

904
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:51,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, shit.</font>

905
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that's why
she chose you.</font>

906
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:57,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four passengers left.
Which one is it?</font>

907
01:00:58,298 --> 01:01:00,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

908
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you got to lose
and you don't know.</font>

909
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:05,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed that agent.</font>

910
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's on you, man.</font>

911
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much is she paying you
to kill the witness?</font>

912
01:01:10,076 --> 01:01:11,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as you, I guess.</font>

913
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:14,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not really
how it works out, is it?</font>

914
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how much they pay,
you always end up owing more.</font>

915
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:22,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Prynne, Michael?
Tell me now.</font>

916
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

917
01:01:26,527 --> 01:01:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea
who you're up against.</font>

918
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:34,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you?
- Yes, Michael. I do.</font>

919
01:01:35,637 --> 01:01:39,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drop it.
- Take it easy.</font>

920
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:46,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

921
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Prynne?</font>

922
01:02:32,693 --> 01:02:35,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- You're lying.</font>

923
01:03:14,635 --> 01:03:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be stupid. Stop.</font>

924
01:03:16,603 --> 01:03:18,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until Prynne is dead.</font>

925
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:22,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you do that.</font>

926
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:17,429
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're out of time.
Who's Prynne?</i></font>

927
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:20,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.
Your guy is dead.</font>

928

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You have the gun?</i></font>

929
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:28,543
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Take it, Michael.
Take the weapon.</i></font>

930
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:36,313
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kill Prynne, retrieve the bag,
and your family lives.</i></font>

931
01:04:36,315 --> 01:04:39,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am not gonna do this.
- <i>You can't have it both ways.</i></font>

932
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:43,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You can save the witness
or your family.</i></font>

don't you?</i></font>

934

what you started.</i></font>

935

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now arriving Garrison, folks.</i></font>

936
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:57,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mike, what happened
to the guy with the guitar?</font>

937
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:59,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got off.</font>

938
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:04,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I better not be staying at
a bed and breakfast this time.</font>

939
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:06,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-uh. No way.</font>

940
01:05:13,487 --> 01:05:15,588
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Next stop, Cold Spring.</i></font>

941

- What?</font>

943
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:46,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you going
to Cold Spring?</font>

944
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's none of your business.</font>

945
01:05:51,592 --> 01:05:53,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's in the bag?
- My God.</font>

946
01:05:53,728 --> 01:05:56,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is with you people
and my bag? Jeez.</font>

947
01:05:57,398 --> 01:05:58,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Prynne?</font>

948
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

949
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:01,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let go of me.
- I'm trying to help you.</font>

950
01:06:01,335 --> 01:06:02,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, come on, do something.</font>

951
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:04,469

- What's your problem?</font>

952
01:06:04,472 --> 01:06:05,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, you gotta let the lady go.</font>

953
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:06,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get it, do you?</font>

954
01:06:06,907 --> 01:06:08,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants you dead.
You witnessed a murder.</font>

955
01:06:08,742 --> 01:06:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have something
that she wants,</font>

956

<font color="#FFFFFF">something she's
willing to kill for.</font>

Let the lady go.</font>

958

you're looking for, okay?</font>

965
01:06:55,523 --> 01:07:01,592

1028
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dispatch, do you copy?</font>

1029
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:40,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">The brakes have malfunctioned.</font>

1030
01:10:40,914 --> 01:10:43,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no way
to stop the train.</font>

1031
01:10:44,418 --> 01:10:45,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">You what?</font>

1032
01:10:45,552 --> 01:10:47,787
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We'll have
to clear the tracks.</i></font>

1033
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roger.</font>

1034
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:50,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dispatch is gonna
clear the tracks.</font>

1035
01:10:50,524 --> 01:10:51,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1036
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a curve
just before Beacon.</font>

1037
01:10:54,027 --> 01:10:55,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we hit it
at 70 miles an hour,</font>

1038
01:10:55,829 --> 01:10:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're gonna derail for sure.</font>

1039
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:00,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the passengers
are in the last car.</font>

1040
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:03,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can we detach it?
- We have to try. Come on.</font>

1041
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:08,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta unhook the couplers.</font>

1042
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a coupler
safety latch.</font>

1043
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can only be released
from underneath the car.</font>

1044
01:11:16,114 --> 01:11:18,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone will have to pull
the knuckle pin,</font>

1045
01:11:18,118 --> 01:11:21,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one of us will have to go
down and release the latch.</font>

1046
01:11:25,123 --> 01:11:27,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No friggin' way.
I'm not going down there.</font>

1047
01:11:27,027 --> 01:11:28,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just outside...</font>

1048
01:11:28,094 --> 01:11:29,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care. Shut up.
I'm not going down there.</font>

1049
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:31,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just outside
and down the ladder.</font>

1050
01:11:31,064 --> 01:11:33,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll do it.
- Yeah, you do it.</font>

1051
01:11:33,231 --> 01:11:34,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you go
tell the passengers</font>

1052
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">to brace themselves.</font>

1053
01:11:36,069 --> 01:11:37,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do that.</font>

1054
01:11:40,474 --> 01:11:43,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got about two minutes.
You make them count.</font>

1055
01:11:43,074 --> 01:11:45,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay calm.
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm.</font>

1056
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:48,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remain calm.
- Why?</font>

1057
01:11:48,146 --> 01:11:49,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time
to argue with you, lady.</font>

1058
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:50,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down. Take your seats.</font>

1059
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:53,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everyone, sit down. Sit down.
- I am sitting down.</font>

1060
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:53,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

1061
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chain is caught.</font>

1062
01:13:21,576 --> 01:13:23,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need more leverage.
I'll get the ax.</font>

1063
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between the train
and the people,</font>

1064
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:41,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always knew
it would be the train.</font>

1065
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:27,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I'm okay.
You all right? Come on.</font>

1066
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:29,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get that door open.
- Everyone okay?</font>

1067
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:31,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We gotta get out.
- Open the door.</font>

1068
01:15:31,971 --> 01:15:34,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay calm.
Don't get off the train.</font>

1069
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, listen.</font>

1070
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:38,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get the door open.
- We gotta get out.</font>

1071
01:15:41,212 --> 01:15:44,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackson, close the door.
This isn't over yet.</font>

1072
01:15:44,115 --> 01:15:47,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still in danger.
Everyone grab a newspaper.</font>

1073
01:15:47,185 --> 01:15:50,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cover the windows.
Use water, soda, anything.</font>

1074
01:15:50,457 --> 01:15:51,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, this is crazy.</font>

1075
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:54,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, get some water.
Cover the windows.</font>

1076
01:16:07,474 --> 01:16:09,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are we doing this, Mike?
- Just do it.</font>

1077
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:11,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know who's out there.</font>

1078
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's watching.
They tried to kill us all.</font>

1079
01:16:12,945 --> 01:16:14,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- Yeah.</font>

1080
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're all scared,
but I need your help.</font>

1081
01:16:22,253 --> 01:16:24,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of you
can leave, not yet.</font>

1082
01:16:24,356 --> 01:16:27,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until I know
everyone's safe.</font>

1083
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:30,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">They murdered innocent people.
They derailed the train.</font>

1084
01:16:30,896 --> 01:16:33,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did this.
All to find a witness.</font>

1085
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:38,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something she has
that they want.</font>

1086
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:42,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said
if I didn't kill you,</font>

1087
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:44,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">they would kill
my wife, my son.</font>

1088
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I would never.</font>

1089
01:16:45,145 --> 01:16:47,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never do
what these people want.</font>

1090
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:49,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help.</font>

1091
01:16:49,382 --> 01:16:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know
why they want you dead.</font>

1092
01:16:57,457 --> 01:17:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Sofia.</font>

1093
01:17:00,192 --> 01:17:01,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sofia.</font>

1094
01:17:03,162 --> 01:17:05,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Come here.</font>

1095
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to let them
hurt you, okay?</font>

1096
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:19,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you show me
what's in your bag?</font>

1097
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:35,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">This? This is what they want?</font>

1098
01:17:37,463 --> 01:17:38,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why?</font>

1099
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:41,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of Enrique.</font>

1100
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was his.</font>

1101
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:45,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy who threw himself
off the 35th floor?</font>

1102
01:17:45,438 --> 01:17:47,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ricky didn't kill himself.</font>

1103
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were there when he died?</font>

1104
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:55,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Tell me.</font>

1105
01:17:56,983 --> 01:17:58,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what you saw.</font>

1106
01:18:01,855 --> 01:18:04,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ricky was a city planner,</font>

1107
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:08,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">and some nights
he would have to work late,</font>

1108
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:12,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I would go to his office
to finish my homework.</font>

1109
01:18:12,096 --> 01:18:14,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was waiting
for Ricky by the elevator</font>

1110
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:17,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">when these two men show up.</font>

1111
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:20,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see their faces,</font>

1112
01:18:20,137 --> 01:18:22,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they were
looking for Ricky.</font>

1113
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hid 'cause I didn't wanna
get him in trouble.</font>

1114
01:18:29,382 --> 01:18:31,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they wanted
something from him.</font>

1115
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:37,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then all of them
start yelling,</font>

1116
01:18:37,356 --> 01:18:39,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I hear this noise.</font>

1117
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were hurting him.
I could hear him screaming.</font>

1118
01:18:42,662 --> 01:18:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he tells them
that he doesn't have it,</font>

1119
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it's back at his place.</font>

1120
01:18:46,265 --> 01:18:48,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You took it.
- Of course I took it.</font>

1121
01:18:48,568 --> 01:18:51,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to help.</font>

1122
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:58,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I look through the
doorway and I see this guy.</font>

1123
01:18:58,543 --> 01:19:01,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's holding Ricky,
and he hits him,</font>

1124
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:04,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he says something
about being noble.</font>

1125
01:19:05,518 --> 01:19:06,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noble?</font>

1126
01:19:06,653 --> 01:19:09,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says that doing the right
thing will get you killed,</font>

1127
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:12,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that there's no such thing
as being noble.</font>

1128
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:14,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then,</font>

1129
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:17,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">they just...</font>

1130
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what to do.</font>

1131
01:19:27,606 --> 01:19:28,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1132
01:19:28,942 --> 01:19:31,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just took it and I ran.</font>

1133
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:33,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you
call the police?</font>

1134
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:34,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't call the police.</font>

1135
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:38,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men
who killed him were cops.</font>

1136
01:19:40,552 --> 01:19:43,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1137
01:19:43,288 --> 01:19:46,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the next day I just...
I went to a friend's,</font>

1138
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:49,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she knew
someone in the FBI.</font>

1139
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:51,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy, Agent Garcia,</font>

1140
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:53,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">he says that
this drive is evidence,</font>

1141
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:55,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that I'm a witness.</font>

1142
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says it's not safe for me
in the city anymore,</font>

1143
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">tells me to catch the 6:25</font>

1144
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Cold Spring,
and they'll protect me.</font>

1145
01:20:03,509 --> 01:20:06,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You told no one else?
- No.</font>

1146
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:10,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend trusts
this Agent Garcia, yeah?</font>

1147
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:13,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1148
01:20:15,252 --> 01:20:19,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone out there
wants you to disappear.</font>

1149
01:20:19,056 --> 01:20:23,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it's not him... Who?</font>

1150
01:20:37,074 --> 01:20:38,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1151
01:20:50,757 --> 01:20:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.</font>

1152
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:53,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

1153
01:21:09,809 --> 01:21:11,011
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>MacCauley.</i></font>

1154
01:21:15,047 --> 01:21:17,148

1156
01:21:18,418 --> 01:21:21,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entrance clear.
Let's go, go, go, go.</font>

1157
01:21:23,122 --> 01:21:24,721
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We have the train surrounded.</i></font>

1158
01:21:24,724 --> 01:21:26,592
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There is nowhere
for you to go.</i></font>

1159
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:31,662
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Throw out your weapon.</i></font>

1160
01:21:31,664 --> 01:21:33,197
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My men will come aboard.</i></font>

1161
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:35,600
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They will escort
the hostages to safety.</i></font>

1162
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:39,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay. Don't be alarmed.
- <i>You will not be harmed.</i></font>

1163
01:21:39,203 --> 01:21:40,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is
normal police procedure.</font>

1164
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:43,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
You will all be safe.</font>

1165
01:21:43,342 --> 01:21:45,345
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No one will be harmed.</i></font>

1166
01:22:00,626 --> 01:22:02,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, there's
a friggin' army out there.</font>

1167
01:22:08,601 --> 01:22:11,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agent Garcia, come to me.</font>

1168
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:14,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need tactical staged
and ready to breach, okay?</font>

1169
01:22:14,574 --> 01:22:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir.
- Thanks.</font>

1170
01:22:17,376 --> 01:22:19,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Overwatch?</font>

1171
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:23,648
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Overwatch, this is command.</i></font>

1172
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:26,117

I need to know.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is bad, Mike.
- It'll be fine, I promise.</font>

01:22:34,527 --> 01:22:37,662
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>MacCauley,
you'have an old friend here.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He wants to come aboard,
and he wants to talk.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Your tag is lit.</font>

1178
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:11,429

outside the town of Beacon,</i></font>

1179
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:13,663
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>where a Hudson
North train has derailed.</i></font>

1181
01:23:17,703 --> 01:23:18,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back.</font>

1182
01:23:18,838 --> 01:23:20,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go. Move back.</font>

1183
01:23:20,373 --> 01:23:21,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go.</font>

1184
01:23:24,377 --> 01:23:26,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got sound
on Lieutenant Murphy.</font>

our source on the ground,</i></font>

the passengers hostage.</i></font>

1188
01:23:42,328 --> 01:23:43,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mike,
how we doing in there?</font>

1189
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, man,
you know how this goes.</font>

1190
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:48,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't work this out, SWAT's
gonna take the train by force.</font>

1191
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:52,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, talk to me, buddy.</font>

1192
01:23:56,475 --> 01:23:57,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my family?</font>

1193
01:23:57,743 --> 01:23:59,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said police
were on their way.</font>

1194
01:23:59,011 --> 01:24:00,944
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They were, man.
I don't know what happened.</i></font>

1195
01:24:00,947 --> 01:24:03,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we're doing
the best we can.</font>

1196
01:24:03,548 --> 01:24:05,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know
what's going on, Murph.</font>

1197
01:24:05,451 --> 01:24:07,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then tell me, all right?</font>

1198
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:10,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just open the door, let me in.
I'm unarmed. I'm alone.</font>

1199
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:19,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many people
you got in there?</font>

1200
01:24:22,435 --> 01:24:24,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, I wanna help you.
You gotta help me out.</font>

1201
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:26,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I don't produce results,
they're gonna pull me out.</font>

1202
01:24:26,838 --> 01:24:29,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how many
hostages do you have?</font>

1203
01:24:29,509 --> 01:24:31,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta do something.</font>

1204
01:24:31,377 --> 01:24:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but what?
What can we do?</font>

1205
01:24:34,347 --> 01:24:36,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifteen, 20.</font>

1206
01:24:36,382 --> 01:24:39,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, just let some go.
Whoever you want.</font>

1207
01:24:39,018 --> 01:24:40,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know they'll be safe?</font>

1208
01:24:42,387 --> 01:24:44,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hostages?</font>

1209
01:24:44,256 --> 01:24:46,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's someone
I need to protect.</font>

1210
01:24:46,893 --> 01:24:48,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you're worried
about someone's safety,</font>

1211
01:24:48,728 --> 01:24:49,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">just send them out with me.</font>

1212
01:24:52,265 --> 01:24:54,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

1213
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:55,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

1214
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:01,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven years we were partners.
You always had my back.</font>

1215
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let someone else
have yours for once.</font>

1216
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:07,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike.</font>

1217
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:12,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I tell you what.
I'll make an exchange, okay?</font>

1218
01:25:12,283 --> 01:25:15,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Release some hostages
and take me instead.</font>

1219
01:25:32,637 --> 01:25:33,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming out.</font>

1220
01:25:34,907 --> 01:25:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on out.
Come on out.</font>

1221
01:25:37,677 --> 01:25:39,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Come on. This way.</font>

1222
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:41,311
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Watch your step.
Go that way. Follow her.</i></font>

1223
01:25:41,314 --> 01:25:42,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, stay in line.</font>

1224
01:25:42,615 --> 01:25:45,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, it does appear
that hostages are being released.</i></font>

1225
01:25:45,851 --> 01:25:49,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It is unclear at this time
how many remain on the train.</i></font>

1226
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:58,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that it?
- Yeah. Come on.</font>

1227
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Patrol's on
their way to your house.</font>

1228
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:05,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sirens.</font>

1229
01:26:11,777 --> 01:26:13,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have you tagged.</font>

1230
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:16,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">This goes on much longer,
they're gonna board.</font>

1231
01:26:16,114 --> 01:26:17,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't want a cop
caught in the crossfire.</font>

1232
01:26:19,018 --> 01:26:21,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, put the gun down.</font>

1233
01:26:21,087 --> 01:26:22,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, I'm unarmed. Come on.</font>

1234
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:33,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them
to turn the lights off.</font>

1235
01:26:33,733 --> 01:26:35,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kill the lights.</i></font>

1236
01:26:36,369 --> 01:26:37,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the lights.</font>

1237
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, pal.
- Come on, you know the deal.</font>

1238
01:26:43,643 --> 01:26:45,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost audio.</font>

1239
01:26:45,845 --> 01:26:48,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right, there is
a witness on the train.</font>

1240
01:26:48,581 --> 01:26:50,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were supposed to meet
the FBI at Cold Spring.</font>

1241
01:26:50,817 --> 01:26:54,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">- FBI? Special Agent Garcia?
- You know?</font>

1242
01:26:54,552 --> 01:26:56,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorne just pulled
jurisdiction from him.</font>

1243
01:26:56,422 --> 01:26:58,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorne. That figures.</font>

1244
01:26:58,123 --> 01:27:01,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want eyes on.
Confirm visuals.</font>

1245
01:27:02,494 --> 01:27:04,895
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Friendly fire tag
is lit in blue.</i></font>

1246
01:27:04,896 --> 01:27:06,162
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Visual confirmed.</i></font>

1247
01:27:06,163 --> 01:27:08,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, what the hell happened?</font>

1248
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:09,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I talk to you,</font>

1249
01:27:09,536 --> 01:27:11,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">next thing I know
you're taking people hostage.</font>

1250
01:27:12,671 --> 01:27:14,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">They killed three passengers,
including a fed.</font>

1251
01:27:14,472 --> 01:27:16,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">They derailed the train.</font>

1252
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:18,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All to get some evidence.
- Okay.</font>

1253
01:27:19,845 --> 01:27:21,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where is it, Mike?</font>

1254
01:27:21,012 --> 01:27:22,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until Karen
and Danny are safe.</font>

1255
01:27:22,648 --> 01:27:24,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Local PD's
calling me directly.</font>

1256
01:27:24,784 --> 01:27:26,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we wait.</font>

1257
01:27:28,921 --> 01:27:30,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wait.</font>

1258
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1259
01:27:36,028 --> 01:27:37,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you guys doing?</font>

1260
01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:38,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I'm good.
- Not too bad.</font>

1261
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:41,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, perfect.
- Fine, but I gotta pee.</font>

1262
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:45,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, I know
this isn't you, man.</font>

1263
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:50,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you say they set you up,
you got a witness, evidence.</font>

1264
01:27:50,842 --> 01:27:53,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I believe you, but...
- But what?</font>

1265
01:27:53,177 --> 01:27:54,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter
what I believe.</font>

1266
01:27:54,914 --> 01:27:57,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I can prove.</font>

1267
01:27:57,483 --> 01:27:59,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you want confirmation
on your family. I understand.</font>

1268
01:27:59,717 --> 01:28:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">But from where I sit,</font>

1269
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:02,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we end
this thing right now.</font>

1270
01:28:02,186 --> 01:28:05,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give me what you got,
nobody else has to get hurt.</font>

1271
01:28:05,056 --> 01:28:09,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">You telling me that
as a detective or a friend?</font>

1272
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:11,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Mike.
What would you tell me?</font>

1273
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're running
out of time, man.</font>

1274
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:21,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, I get it. You wanna
do the noble thing here.</font>

1275
01:28:21,774 --> 01:28:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I got news for you.</font>

1276
01:28:22,675 --> 01:28:24,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">There ain't
no such thing as noble.</font>

1277
01:28:33,752 --> 01:28:35,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was you.
- What are you talking about?</font>

1278
01:28:35,753 --> 01:28:38,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called me. You knew
about the witness. You...</font>

1279
01:28:40,091 --> 01:28:41,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew what they saw.</font>

1280
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I told you
what happened.</font>

1281
01:28:43,662 --> 01:28:45,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a cop who killed him.</font>

1282
01:28:46,632 --> 01:28:49,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You set me up.
- Hey, slow down, Mike.</font>

1283
01:28:49,167 --> 01:28:51,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed Enrique Mendez.</font>

1284
01:28:51,936 --> 01:28:53,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew Prynne was
getting on this train.</font>

1285
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You targeted me.
- Mike...</font>

1286
01:28:55,841 --> 01:28:59,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">An ex-cop rides this train every day.
You knew.</font>

1287
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:01,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mike, whoever's talking to you,
they're trying to get in your...</font>

1288
01:29:01,012 --> 01:29:02,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a...</font>

1289
01:29:02,145 --> 01:29:04,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've lost it, man.</font>

1290
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk, God damn it. Talk!</font>

1291
01:29:06,585 --> 01:29:07,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Friendly's
engaged with the target.</i></font>

1292
01:29:07,853 --> 01:29:09,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I repeat, friendly's
engaged with the target.</font>

1293
01:29:09,989 --> 01:29:12,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not fire
until you get a clear shot.</font>

1294
01:29:12,591 --> 01:29:14,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">And say what?</font>

1295
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:16,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you killed
three people, a fed?</font>

1296
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:19,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You derailed a train and took
the passengers hostage,</font>

1297
01:29:19,163 --> 01:29:22,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">all 'cause some mystery woman
threatened your family?</font>

1298
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:23,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did this.</font>

1299
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:25,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't look
that way, does it?</font>

1300
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:27,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why don't you
put down the gun</font>

1301
01:29:27,972 --> 01:29:29,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">before someone
you love gets hurt?</font>

1302
01:29:29,942 --> 01:29:32,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they?
Where's my family?</font>

1303
01:29:35,713 --> 01:29:37,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill you, Murph.
I swear to God.</font>

1304
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:41,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, okay.
I'm trying to help you here.</font>

1305
01:29:41,051 --> 01:29:42,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of powerful people
have got a lot to lose</font>

1306
01:29:42,954 --> 01:29:44,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">if that evidence gets out.</font>

1307
01:29:44,288 --> 01:29:47,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have eyes everywhere,
even inside the Bureau.</font>

1308
01:29:47,225 --> 01:29:49,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told them to put the
witness on your train.</font>

1309
01:29:49,127 --> 01:29:50,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was
doing you a favor.</font>

1310
01:29:50,295 --> 01:29:51,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">You needed the money.</font>

1311
01:29:51,463 --> 01:29:54,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you couldn't just do
what she asked, could you?</font>

1312
01:29:59,672 --> 01:30:02,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I don't answer that,
your family dies.</font>

1313
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:06,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why don't you
give me the gun?</font>

1314
01:30:07,947 --> 01:30:09,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got no choice, Mike.</font>

1315
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't have to
end this way.</font>

1316
01:30:15,688 --> 01:30:18,020
