<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello.</i></font>

2
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,201
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I come from outside the wall,</i></font>

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,681
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>where we have all
but destroyed each other.</i></font>

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,207
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We designed your city
as an experiment.</i></font>

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,728
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We believe it is the only way to recover
the humanity we have lost.</i></font>

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,609
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And we created factions
to ensure peace.</i></font>

7
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,762
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But we believe there will be
those among you</i></font>

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,923
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>who will transcend these factions.</i></font>

9
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>These will be the Divergent.</i></font>

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They are the true purpose
of this experiment.</i></font>

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,609
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They are vital to humanity's survival.</i></font>

12
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,170
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If you're watching this now,</i></font>

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment has succeeded.</i></font>

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,609
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.</i></font>

15
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Evelyn's orders,
this gate is now closed.</font>

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,727
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We've allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us.</i></font>

17
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,087
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But you're not.</i></font>

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mankind waits for you,
with hope, beyond the wall.</i></font>

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're almost there.</font>

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm right behind you.</font>

21
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, are you afraid of heights?</font>

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Who told you that?</font>

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, when I look past the wall,</font>

24
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that I can see
something out there.</font>

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you?
- No. I don't.</font>

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you need to look harder.</font>

27
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am looking.
I'm just not seeing what you're seeing.</font>

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it's right
in front of your face, you will.</font>

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we're really gonna do this?</font>

30
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

31
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,447
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>People of Chicago...</i></font>

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know you're curious
about what's beyond the wall,</i></font>

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,649
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but sometimes walls
are there to protect us.</i></font>

34
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,088
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Remember, the Founders were the ones
who divided us into factions.</i></font>

35
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So until we know their intentions,
the wall must stay closed.</i></font>

36
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,126
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Jeanine is dead.</i></font>

37
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,725
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Today, we begin the trials
of her conspirators...</i></font>

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the traitors on trial,
close down the gate.</font>

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't take her long to make
the same mistakes as Jeanine.</font>

40
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to talk to her.</font>

41
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still think I can bring her around.</font>

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that doesn't change
anything, right?</font>

43
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to get
some things for me.</font>

45
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just this?</font>

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure you don't want
the sun and moon as well?</font>

47
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know it's a lot.
- It's impossible.</font>

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So?
- So I'll make it happen.</font>

49
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello, ladies.
Where we going? Can I come?</font>

50
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give it up, Peter.
- Oh, so hostile!</font>

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no factions.
We can be friends, right?</font>

52
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we all just get along?</font>

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris.</font>

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be up there
with all the other leaders of the city.</font>

55
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's not me.
I don't wanna make the rules.</font>

56
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great leaders don't seek power.</font>

57
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're called by necessity.</font>

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people need you.</font>

59
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me! Look at me! You rat!</font>

60
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back up!
- You ready to die today?</font>

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right! Yeah!</font>

62
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just sit tight.</font>

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">String his ass up!</font>

65
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all find ourselves on new ground.</font>

66
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dedicated my life
to seeking the truth.</font>

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But under Jeanine, it passed me by.</font>

68
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for that, I humbly apologize.</font>

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my personal failure</font>

70
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">has only strengthened my resolve
to make things right.</font>

71
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">While the faction of Candor
may no longer exist,</font>

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everyone to know that I will not
stop leading the pursuit of honesty</font>

73
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">as we rebuild our city.</font>

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

75
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the trials begin!
Justice will be done!</font>

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

77
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the truth set you free.</font>

79
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there is no doubt, Max, that you
helped Jeanine take over Chicago</font>

80
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">and exert brutal control
over its citizens.</font>

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">So my only question to you is this...</font>

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you feel justified in murdering
people in support of her regime?</font>

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

84
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are sheep.</font>

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need a Shepherd to guide them.</font>

86
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they resist,</font>

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're slaughtered.</font>

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monster.
- We should slaughter you!</font>

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

90
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, kill him!</font>

91
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him! Kill him now!</font>

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill him!
Don't kill him!</font>

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let him live!
- Kill him!</font>

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let him live!
Kill him now!</font>

95
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise above it!</font>

96
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do this! Stop it!</font>

97
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him live!
We're better than this!</font>

98
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rise above it!
- No!</font>

99
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeanine... Jeanine is dead.</font>

100
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not keep her spirit alive.</font>

101
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!
Let him live!</font>

102
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do?</font>

103
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need an answer.</font>

104
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an execution.</font>

105
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. This is a trial.</font>

106
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I yield
to the wishes of the people.</font>

107
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is time that we break
from the past.</font>

108
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

109
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

110
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to die!</font>

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a murderer!
He should die!</font>

112
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna die.</font>

113
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither did your sheep.</font>

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo! Yeah!</font>

115
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a time I would've said,
"I leave you in love, not malice."</font>

116
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">That time is past.</font>

117
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Coward!
- Traitor!</font>

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out! Get out!</font>

119
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traitor!</font>

120
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out, now! Get out!</font>

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out, out, out, out!</font>

122
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beatrice!</font>

123
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

124
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You incited a mob.
Good luck controlling them.</font>

125
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beatrice, please!
Don't let them kill me!</font>

126
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beatrice, no!</font>

127
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beatrice!</font>

128
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell do you think
you're doing?</font>

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to show a united front,</font>

130
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially since Tris
refuses to stand with us.</font>

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not gonna tell Tris what to do.
- Well, you need to try.</font>

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think that you can
stop people leaving this city?</font>

133
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wall's on total lockdown.</font>

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">My soldiers have orders.
No one gets out.</font>

135
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you go to war with Jeanine</font>

136
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you were just gonna become her?</font>

137
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leaders need to make tough decisions
to protect their people.</font>

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll understand that
when you take over for me.</font>

139
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing this for you.</font>

140
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,919
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You know, it might
not be the best time to leave.</i></font>

141
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, but we can't be here
for every fight.</font>

142
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the message said to come out
and meet the rest of the world.</font>

143
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we know absolutely nothing
about the people who sent it.</font>

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">But aren't you curious to find out?</font>

145
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about our home?</font>

146
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think our home
exists anymore.</font>

147
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe the way to help Chicago
is going beyond the wall.</font>

148
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what if there's nothing out there?
What if there is nothing left?</font>

149
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can live with that
if you're with me.</font>

150
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,682

He betrayed you.</font>

He should be loyal. I'm loyal.</font>

351
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you are. So rest up.
I need you ready to fight.</font>

352
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

353
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they've been studying us
for 200 years and we need to catch up.</font>

354
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna give it a chance, right?</font>

355
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. 'Course we are.</font>

360
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't go together?</font>

361
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since you were the one who opened
the box which invited you here,</font>

370
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Chicago is just one
of 50 major cities</font>

371
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,809

on th is continent alone.</font>

372
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,681

373
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all like this now?</font>

374
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

375
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">All except for Providence.</font>

376
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why what we're doing here
is so important, Tris.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

378
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be the director.</font>

379
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please, call me David.</font>

380
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a pleasure to finally meet you.</font>

381
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have so many questions.</font>

382
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a bit overwhelmed.
I'm still processing it all.</font>

383
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Tris, I know you.</font>

384
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched you being born.</font>

385
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:27,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the love that your mother
and father had for you.</font>

386
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched a little girl
have a happy childhood</font>

390
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the Council, you are a freak.</font>

391
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me, you are a miracle.</font>

392
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">David, are you aware of what's happening
in Chicago right now?</font>

393
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Yes.</font>

394
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people at Erudite
really made a mess of things,</font>

395
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't want you
to worry about that.</font>

396
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Restoring order in Chicago
is as important to me as it is to you.</font>

397
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only way
to save the Damaged.</font>

398
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the Damaged?</font>

399
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">The genetic alterations
had disastrous consequences.</font>

400
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too brave, and you're cruel.</font>

401
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too peaceful, and you're passive.</font>

402
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too smart, and you lose compassion.</font>

403
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like your brother.</font>

404
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb's Damaged?</font>

405
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

406
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">For nearly 200 years,</font>

407
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">the greatest scientific minds

genetically damaged people</font>

409

<font color="#FFFFFF">from the toxic environment
in the Fringe</font>

410
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put them in a safe place,
like Chicago,</font>

411
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">then perhaps, over time,</font>

412
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:38,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">man's genetic material

414
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,688

415
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the only one.</font>

416
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make any sense.</font>

417
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, uh, Four is Divergent.
There's lots of Divergents.</font>

418
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not Divergent, Tris. Pure.</font>

419
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:57,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are genetically Pure.
The rest are still Damaged.</font>

420
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Four?
- Damaged.</font>

421
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as much as Caleb, but Damaged.</font>

422
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can understand what made <i>you,</i></font>

423
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe we can use that knowledge
to help the Damaged.</font>

424
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what does this
have to do with Chicago?</font>

425
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I answer to the Council.</font>

426
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the ones who ultimately
determine our fate, yours and mine.</font>

427
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna bring you with me
to Providence to meet them.</font>

428
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they see that it's possible,</font>

429
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">that <i>you</i> were possible,
it will change everything.</font>

430
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand it's hard
to take my word for it.</font>

431
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you don't believe me,
believe your mother.</font>

432
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother?</font>

433
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother Natalie
wasn't born in Chicago.</font>

434
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was born in the Fringe
and rescued by the Bureau.</font>

435
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's impossible.</font>

436
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">See for yourself.</font>

437
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are those?</font>

438
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're your mother's memory tabs.</font>

439
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">With them, you can watch
the world th rough her eyes.</font>

440
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I do?</font>

441
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Place one on each temple.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">This separation, I don't like it.</font>

502
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree. And in time,
that won't be necessary.</font>

503
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Tris, I don't know who told you
that being different was a bad thing.</font>

504
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I know it wasn't your mother.</font>

00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Regina, let's talk.</font>

508
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem like a nice lady, but I'm
really not a desk job kind of guy.</font>

00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get claustrophobic.
I need to be where the action is.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The job of surveillance is to keep tabs
on the devolving situation in Chicago.</font>

511
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where the action is.</font>

512
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:22,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hayes, this will be your pod.
Prior, you're next door.</font>

515
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch what's happening.
File a report.</font>

516
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what? Hold on.
I just escaped from Chicago.</font>

517
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're saying I gotta sit here
and watch it for the rest of my life?</font>

518
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Caleb?</font>

519
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'd prefer
to be banished to the Fringe?</font>

520
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, this surveillance
technology's incredible.</font>

521
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever created this is a genius.</font>

522
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you.
It was a labor of love.</font>

523
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,726

524
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,688

525
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, get to it.</font>

526
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:38,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

527
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an awful lot of firepower.</font>

528
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fringe is full
of dangerous people.</font>

529
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put this on.</font>

530
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,762

at Dauntless, huh?</font>

533
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except there's nothing old
about any of this.</font>

534

535
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,686

00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much.</font>

543
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,125

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

548
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you a question?</font>

549
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Of course.</font>

550
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:53,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my mother was born in the Fringe,</font>

551
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">then how did she end up in Chicago?</font>

552
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you couldn't just send her
through the gate, right?</font>

553
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, the Council's always careful</font>

554
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">how they introduce any new element
to the experiment.</font>

555
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. But when they need to,
they intervene.</font>

556
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

557
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:11,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why aren't they intervening now?</font>

558
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they will.
We just have to make our case.</font>

559
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I still count on you to help me?</font>

560
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Can I count on you?</font>

561
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeanine never had
a chance against you.</font>

you're calling yourselves?</font>

564
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amity just doesn't seem
appropriate anymore.</font>

565
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what exactly are you allegiant to?</font>

566
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:55,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">The faction system?</font>

567
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">The factions kept Chicago
peaceful for a long time.</font>

568
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wouldn't know about that
because I was forced out of my faction.</font>

569
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave up my life,
my child, everything.</font>

570
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand your anger,
Evelyn, I do.</font>

571
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the way forward...</font>

572
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way forward has already begun.</font>

573
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I said I'd be alone,
but I'm not Candor.</font>

574
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not Amity.</font>

575
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I will lie and I will fight
if I have to.</font>

576
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see these scars?</font>

577
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't born Amity.</font>

578
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can assure you, I'm not afraid
to fight for what I believe in.</font>

579
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like we're two peas in a pod.</font>

580
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't have to be this way.</font>

581
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:42,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can come to some
sort of agreement.</font>

582
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back!
- Stop! Stop!</font>

583
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no!
Get outta here!</font>

584
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Caleb.</font>

585
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep me posted
if anything changes, all right?</font>

586
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

587
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb said that some of the Dauntless
are lining up with Johanna.</font>

588
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the rest of Candor
is still solidly with Evelyn.</font>

589
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are spiraling out of control.</font>

590
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has David said anything
about what he can do?</font>

591
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah, once we talk to the Council,
then the Bureau can step in.</font>

592
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it all hinges on the mysterious
Council, does it?</font>

593
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What if they say no?
- David is confident that they won't.</font>

594
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">David. Right.</font>

595
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I found out
why I can't go upstairs?</font>

596
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Damaged and you're Pure.</font>

597
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

598
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know. When were
you gonna tell me?</font>

599
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, I... I guess
I didn't think that it mattered.</font>

600
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why doesn't it matter?</font>

601
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it doesn't make a difference
if you're Pure or if you're Damaged.</font>

602
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still the same person to me.</font>

603
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know that it's not perfect
by any means,</font>

604
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the Bureau saved my mother
from the Fringe.</font>

605
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:24,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be here without them.</font>

606
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you actually know
about what they do in the Fringe?</font>

607
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what they tell you.</font>

608
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, but...
I'm sorry.</font>

609
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs you upstairs.</font>

610
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs you upstairs.</font>

611
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people are nice.
Weird, but nice.</font>

612
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:04,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they're definitely
weird. That's for sure.</font>

613
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kinda get used to it.</font>

614
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:08,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

615
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time you go to the Fringe,
I want in.</font>

616
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not ready.
- I'm going.</font>

617
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, I am more than aware</font>

618
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the separation has been difficult
for you and Four.</font>

619
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've watched you both
enough to know</font>

620
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,050

are going to work it out.</font>

00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's fine.</font>

623
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Let's get to work.</font>

624
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,280

we are green for a run.</font>

- You, let's go, let's go!</font>

627
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Move! Let's go!
Ready to go!</font>

628

629
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,244

listen up!</font>

630
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">This may be a humanitarian mission,</font>

631
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,927

is very dangerous.</font>

Yes!</font>

633
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,923

- 25, 30 years.</font>

634
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,367

up to 50 or 60 in the Bureau.</font>

635
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dauntless, if it was up to me,
you would not be out here.</font>

636
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you think it was tough
in Chicago, but this is the Fringe.</font>

637
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Understood?
- Yes.</font>

638
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,728

as many kids as possible.</font>

in hellish conditions.</font>

You stick to protocol.</font>

with the director, huh?</font>

696
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Vaccinations.
- What do you mean, vaccinations?</font>

697
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:41,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't given vaccinations.</font>

698
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four.</font>

699
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:46,525

- Yep.</font>

706
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:13,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a humanitarian mission.</font>

707
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not saving kids.
We're stealing them.</font>

708
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what we do. Now you know.</font>

709
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">David takes them out from here,
wipes their memories with the gas,</font>

710
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:23,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">and raises them in the Bureau.</font>

711
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you take away what they know,
then you take away who they are.</font>

712
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I think that's the point.</font>

713
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were all unarmed.</font>

714
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't surrender to this.</font>

715
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Round up everyone who's left.</font>

716
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">We take the fight to Evelyn.</font>

717

720
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it takes.</font>

721
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

722
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:35,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all real time.</font>

723
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the surveillance technology
they have in place is extraordinary.</font>

724
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb, can you get out of your head
for a second?</font>

725
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our home.
And there's gonna be a war.</font>

727
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:51,202

738
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,289

744
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an unfortunate accident, sir.</font>

it was the wrong thing to do.</font>

01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your choice was between
a healthy child or a sick old man,</font>

749
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">- who would you choose?
- I wouldn't choose.</font>

750
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Now they're both dead.</font>

751
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:24,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go.</font>

752
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, we're going back to Chicago.
We should never have left.</font>

753
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, we have to wait.
- No, we've been waiting, okay?</font>

754
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">David is not the person
that you think he is.</font>

755
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:35,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four, you know nothing about David.</font>

756
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've no idea
what we've been working on up here.</font>

757
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you been working on?</font>

758
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
what is going on out there?</font>

759
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:42,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course I do.</font>

760
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:44,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think we're going to meet
with the Council?</font>

761
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris...</font>

762
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:48,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to listen to me.</font>

763
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris.</font>

764
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're coming with me.</font>

765
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:02,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go.</font>

766
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:19,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're making a mistake.</font>

767
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:53,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready?</font>

768
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

769
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,845
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Autopilot engaged.</i></font>

770
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna go back to Chicago,
I'll take you.</font>

771
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:30,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thanks.</font>

772
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna walk
across the Fringe? I don't think so.</font>

773
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:38,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no rule saying
you can't go home, Four. Come on.</font>

774
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.</font>

775
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:54,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">All set!</font>

776
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:57,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take us to Chicago.</font>

777
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I understand how you're feeling,
but what you're about to do</font>

778
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">has ramifications for people
all over the world.</font>

779
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Four doesn't see that,
it's not your fault.</font>

780
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:39,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">David never wanted you to see
what you saw out on the Fringe.</font>

781
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">He keeps tight control.</font>

782
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing happens without his approval.</font>

783
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">And his ship is the only one
that can fly through the camo wall.</font>

784
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you telling me this?</font>

785
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:53,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not taking you to Chicago.</font>

786
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:57,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold on!</font>

787
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:27,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Providence.</font>

788
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:41,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see why they don't want to share.</font>

789
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday the whole world's
gonna look this beautiful.</font>

790
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, as you can see,</font>

791
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">there are multiple genetic markers
supporting this conclusion.</font>

792
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standard personality tests.</font>

793
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:06,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Behavioral evaluations.
Stimulus response.</font>

794
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's passed them all
with flying colors.</font>

795
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:12,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all sounds great,
assuming it's the truth.</font>

796
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Phillip...
- David has lied to us before.</font>

797
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you, David?
I'd like to hear from the girl.</font>

798
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:20,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know why.
She can't tell you anything I'm not.</font>

799
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indulge us, David.</font>

800
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must all come as quite
a shock to you, Miss Prior,</font>

801
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">finding out that you're Pure.</font>

802
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

803
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Pure." I'm not even sure
what that's supposed to mean.</font>

804
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, yes, it is shocking to me.</font>

805
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shocking that the more
I learn about the past,</font>

806
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:43,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">the more I feel like you're all making
the same mistakes over and over again.</font>

807
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, this is not the way.</font>

808
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her speak, David.</font>

809
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">What mistakes, Tris?</font>

810
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human beings can not
be categorized in this way.</font>

811
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't work.</font>

812
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's time to start
embracing everyone</font>

813
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of dividing them into groups,</font>

814
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">regardless of whether they're
Pure or they're Damaged.</font>

815
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">That isn't
what we're here to discuss.</font>

816
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it should be!</font>

817
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:11,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know that all of this
is just an experiment to you,</font>

818
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">but these people in Chicago are real.</font>

819
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they are in a war right now
because of divisions that you created</font>

820
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:19,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you are doing
nothing to help them.</font>

821
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">David has control over
the administration of Chicago.</font>

822
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's only here to extend his funding.</font>

823
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:28,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which we would be happy to do,</font>

824
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if things are
as bad as she says, David,</font>

825
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">shouldn't you get
your house in order first?</font>

826
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said that you couldn't do anything.</font>

827
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:54,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am doing something.</font>

828
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm bringing back the factions.</font>

829
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why?</font>

830
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hoped the Allegiant would take care
of the problem for me.</font>

831
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:05,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">The factions work, Tris.
They keep the peace.</font>

832
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:07,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">They created you.</font>

833
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never should've trusted you.</font>

834
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want change with no sacrifice.</font>

835
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:19,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want peace with no struggle.</font>

836
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:21,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world doesn't work like that.</font>

837
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:42,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

838
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:45,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be fine. The Bureau isn't far.</font>

839
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get to Chicago.</font>

840
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Evelyn she's got
a lot bigger problems than Johanna.</font>

841
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:51,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

842
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need this
to get through the camo wall.</font>

843
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your help, Tobias.</font>

844
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what he's capable of.</font>

845
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Tris?</font>

846
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as she stays
in the Bureau, she's safe.</font>

847
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:10,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's too valuable to him.</font>

848
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need a head start.</font>

849
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:18,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when David asks,</font>

850
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to tell him
that I left you behind. Okay?</font>

851
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

852
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because then Tris
will know you're lying.</font>

853
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was an accident.</font>

854
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was turbulence.</font>

855
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:46,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not more than any other storm, but...</font>

856
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lightning, maybe.</font>

857
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We just went down.
- Where's Four?</font>

858
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:54,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I passed out.</font>

859
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:58,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I came to, everyone was dead.
Four left me behind.</font>

860
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we search the settlements,
search the Fringe.</font>

861
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure he's not there.</font>

862
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, we'll find him.
I promise.</font>

863
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four would never leave anyone
behind at the crash site.</font>

864
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:16,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. He told me you would say that.</font>

865
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four's trying to make
his way back to Chicago.</font>

866
01:19:58,279 --> 01:19:59,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter.</font>

867
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, David.</font>

868
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think that you knew my name.</font>

869
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know all of the important people
from Chicago.</font>

870
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

871
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I'm so important,</font>

872
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">then why did you give me
such a terrible job?</font>

873
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all
have to make sacrifices.</font>

874
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see you making any.</font>

875
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter...</font>

876
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need help with something in Chicago.</font>

877
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in it for me?</font>

878
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you do well,
you can have any job you want.</font>

879
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except mine.</font>

880
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where Peter is?</font>

881
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um... He's not in his pod?
- No.</font>

882
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't know where he is.</font>

883
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is-is there something
that I can help you with?</font>

884
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you find Four?</font>

885
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell anyone.</font>

886
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, of course.</font>

887
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you need, Beatrice.</font>

888
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:09,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Four, where are you?</font>

889
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:13,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evelyn.</font>

890
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:16,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found him outside the wall.</font>

891
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it off.</font>

892
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my son?</font>

893
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

894
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edgar told me what's out there,</font>

895
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you better start talking
or we'll be holding your trial now.</font>

896
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you won't.</font>

897
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I have
something that you need.</font>

898
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? And what's that?</font>

899
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way to win your war.</font>

900
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

901
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any news?</font>

902
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

903
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
Tris...</font>

904
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:06,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you find him?
- Yes, I found Four.</font>

905
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's something else
you're gonna wanna see, too.</font>

906
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go.</font>

907
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:15,680
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Over there!</i></font>

908
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him! We got him!</font>

909
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:22,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four.</font>

910
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, he's fine.
Just keep watching.</font>

911
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

912
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna love it.</font>

913
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

914
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:08,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try it out. You'll see.</font>

915
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just don't try it on anyone you like.</font>

916
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering when you'd have
the courage to face me.</font>

917
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:23,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three weeks you leave me here.</font>

918
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:25,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ran a faction!</font>

919
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:28,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">I protected our son
from Jeanine's thugs.</font>

920
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protected him?
Is that what you call it?</font>

921
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beating your own child!</font>

922
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made him who he is.</font>

923
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:55,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure he gets a good dose.</font>

924
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,127
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tobias... I'm just trying
to help you to be better.</i></font>

925
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm s... I'm s... I'm sorry, but...</font>

926
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

927
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh...</font>

928
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just imagine if you released
this on the Allegiant.</font>

929
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even Johanna will remember a time
that you weren't in charge.</font>

930
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who exactly told you about this?</font>

931
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a very powerful friend
on the outside</font>

932
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you choose to engage
instead of prepare.</font>

933
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does this friend have a name?
- David.</font>

934
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:30,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- David?
<i>You can tell my friend</i></font>

935
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna use that thing
unless it's a last resort.</font>

936
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would David support Evelyn?</font>

937
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't make any sense.</font>

938
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:49,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?
I was worried about you.</font>

939
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evelyn, you need to make peace
with the Allegiant.</font>

940
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Johanna made her choice.</font>

941
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never wanted this war,
but I will end it, I promise you.</font>

942
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea what you're up against.
Johanna is not the issue.</font>

943
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:05,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know you're angry at me
and I understand that.</font>

944
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:09,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just... I never meant...</font>

945
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is hard for me, too.
I don't wanna have to keep you in here.</font>

946
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let me out.</font>

947
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. I have responsibilities.</font>

948
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day you'll understand that,
but right now I need you to stay here.</font>

949
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:28,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna finish this.
One way or another.</font>

950
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you gonna finish this?</font>

951
01:27:31,239 --> 01:27:33,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't worry.
You won't have to be here for long.</font>

952
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:36,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... What are you talking about?</font>

953
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Evelyn's deciding now.</font>

954
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she uses the memory serum,
Chicago might forget its own name.</font>

955
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:34,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go.</font>

956
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get Christina and meet me outside.</font>

957
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we going?</font>

958
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Home.</font>

959
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Access granted.</i></font>

960
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it going in Chicago?</font>

961
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making sure it's safe from Evelyn
and the Factionless?</font>

962
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, you need to forget about Chicago.</font>

963
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's really funny, David.</font>

964
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been watching me for years
and you don't know anything about me.</font>

965
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wiping the memories
of everyone in Chicago, aren't you?</font>

966
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, uh, no...</font>

967
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were never supporting
the Allegiant.</font>

968
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people treated you terribly.
They killed your parents!</font>

969
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:35,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four is there!</font>

970
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four. Yes, yes, Four is there.</font>

971
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's Damaged,
just like the rest of them.</font>

972
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you going?</font>

973
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking your ship
and I'm not coming back.</font>

974
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fly.</font>

975
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch me.</font>

976
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,685
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Autopilot engaged.</i></font>

977
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris Prior is stealing my craft.
Bring her back.</font>

978
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:18,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry.</font>

979
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christina.</font>

980
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:23,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- These are for you and Tris.
- How'd you know we were leaving?</font>

981
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the only ones
who hate David.</font>

982
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, come on.
- Thank you.</font>

983
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:30,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it!
- Get in, get in.</font>

984
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:32,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands to yourself or I throw you out.</font>

985
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:35,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go rescue Four.</font>

986
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like three ships
are following us.</font>

987
01:31:02,439 --> 01:31:04,015
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Plasma craft engaged.</i>
- Surround it.</font>

988
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:05,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give her a nudge towards the ground.</font>

989
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">The autopilot
will bring her down safely.</font>

990
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

991
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they trying to do?</font>

992
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to bring us
in for a landing.</font>

993
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:24,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going manual.</font>

994
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris!</font>

995
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull up! Pull up!</font>

996
01:31:31,239 --> 01:31:34,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying. I'm trying!</font>

997
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Altitude.</i></font>

998
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it.</font>

999
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:58,962
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Your orders, sir?</i></font>

1000
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:00,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her down.</font>

1001
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before she reaches the camo wall.</font>

1002
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't follow her through.</font>

1003
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're dead.</font>

1004
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna die, we're gonna die,
we're gonna die!</font>

1005
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!</font>

1006
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be close.</font>

1007
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:55,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has to be a way
to shut off the gas.</font>

1008
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the ventilation system.
It's all over the city.</font>

1009
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down there.</font>

1010
01:33:00,439 --> 01:33:01,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna.</font>

1011
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got here just in time.</font>

1012
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time, Evelyn.</font>

1013
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said the gas was a last resort.</font>

1014
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

1015
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:26,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think
your trial is going to end?</font>

1016
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me know the second
the serum is released.</font>

1017
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:45,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it. Good luck.</font>

1018
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:46,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1019
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do these drones work?</font>

1020
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:58,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn your headgear on.</font>

1021
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:03,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

1022
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch and learn.</font>

1023
01:34:05,319 --> 01:34:07,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop right there!
Drop your weapons!</font>

1024
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey, whoa, what are you doing?</font>

1025
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me down!</font>

1026
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
this one's all you.</font>

1027
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Easy!
- Sorry.</font>

1028
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay where you are!</font>

1029
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:30,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my girl.</font>

1030
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Recon!</font>

1031
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Screw this! I'm outta here.</font>

1032
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

1033
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1034
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey... I'm sorry.</font>

1035
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never should have trusted him.</font>

1036
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were doing what
you thought was right.</font>

1037
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

1038
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should find Evelyn.</font>

1039
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1040
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ready.</i></font>

1041
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you press that button...</font>

1042
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're completely safe
inside the vault.</font>

1043
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no one else will ever know
what happened to them.</font>

1044
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,322
