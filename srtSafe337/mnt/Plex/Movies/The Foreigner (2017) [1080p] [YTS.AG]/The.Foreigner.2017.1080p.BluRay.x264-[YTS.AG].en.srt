1
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You like it?
- All right.</font>

2
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to go. My dad's here.</font>

3
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.</font>

4
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:13,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the dress. Do you like it?</font>

5
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.</font>

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Dad, let's go.</font>

7
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">When do I meet him?</font>

8
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name's Chappy.</font>

9
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the football team and very...</font>

10
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:37,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chubby?
- Chappy.</font>

11
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:39,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.</font>

12
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not before?</font>

13
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:43,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, you really need to go faster.</font>

14
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will he drive you to the dance?</font>

15
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's rented a limo.</font>

16
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he won't drive you?</font>

17
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:55,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.</font>

18
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:04,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.</font>

19
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to like it.</font>

20
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm getting out.
- No, no, no. Wait until I park.</font>

21
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's already inside.</font>

22
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fan, careful crossing the street!</font>

23
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:14,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stupid...</font>

24
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Metro desk, Ian Wood.</font>

25
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen carefully.</font>

26
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">An action wing of the Authentic IRA</font>

27
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.</font>

28
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">The code word is "Phoenix."</font>

29
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.</font>

30
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions</font>

31
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.</font>

32
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.</font>

33
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.</font>

34
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's the Authentic IRA?</font>

35
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea. Never heard of them.</font>

36
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:05,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.</font>

37
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:09,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.</font>

38
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:12,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.</font>

39
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.</font>

40
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.</font>

41
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?</font>

42
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:22,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for? Get over there.</font>

43
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">have asked
a number of police officials</font>

44
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...</font>

45
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a major incident
that they're treating</font>

46
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a possible terrorist attack.</font>

47
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:38,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bomb went off at exactly...</font>

48
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.</font>

49
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">One theory on the cause of the blast</font>

50
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.</font>

51
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many? How many I get?</font>

52
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.</font>

53
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.</font>

54
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.</font>

55
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.</font>

56
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any problems?</font>

57
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- We should be moving.</font>

58
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:10,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's normal procedure.</font>

59
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:14,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.</font>

60
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:19,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.</font>

61
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?</font>

62
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:48,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.</font>

63
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too bad. What's the time?</font>

64
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.</font>

65
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I'll miss my flight.</font>

66
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:04,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...</font>

67
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Room service for a week.</font>

68
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:08,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sound good?</font>

69
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your work, Deputy Minister?</font>

70
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">An acute case of food poisoning.</font>

71
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to work on your excuses, darling.</font>

72
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

73
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been an IRA bombing in London.</font>

74
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scores dead and injured.</font>

75
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes?
- Jesus, Liam.</font>

76
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?</font>

77
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, yes, I heard.</font>

78
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?</font>

79
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meetings.</font>

80
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Meetings?
- Aye.</font>

81
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">And last night?</font>

82
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't come home. I was worried.</font>

83
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:22,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.</font>

84
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:26,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the guest room wasn't slept in.</font>

85
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who said I slept?</font>

86
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:28,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, cut the crap, Liam.</font>

87
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't come home, plain and simple.</font>

88
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what if I didn't!</font>

89
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:36,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?</font>

90
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.</font>

91
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:43,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.</font>

92
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:48,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...</font>

93
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:51,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.</font>

94
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:54,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus.</font>

95
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:29,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.</font>

96
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:32,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.</font>

97
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.</font>

98
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're depending on you.</font>

99
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:40,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.</font>

100
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:41,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm meeting the Council now.</font>

101
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.</font>

102
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Kate, this is crucial.</font>

103
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.</font>

104
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.</font>

105
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use something now.</font>

106
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:57,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what I'm referring to.</font>

107
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:00,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Royal Pardons.</font>

108
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember your list, the 40 "On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?</font>

109
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cousin's on that list.</font>

110
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:10,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.</font>

111
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.</font>

112
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.</font>

113
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.</font>

114
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:24,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">We keep it quiet.</font>

115
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway</font>

116
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">to press certain men
for something in return.</font>

117
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">As Irish Deputy Minister,</font>

118
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have served the British
government honorably,</font>

119
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">which hasn't always been easy.</font>

120
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">But appeasement is a dangerous thing.</font>

121
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are longstanding issues.</font>

122
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:42,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.</font>

123
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something, Kate.</font>

124
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:47,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.</font>

125
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to hold this together.</font>

126
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:53,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.</font>

127
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:54,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll consider it.</font>

128
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:00,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I want something first,
something real.</font>

129
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:02,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understood.</font>

130
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

131
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're closed. We open at 12:00.</font>

132
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:42,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?</font>

133
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quan.</font>

134
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:46,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Upstairs.</font>

135
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:52,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.</font>

136
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you positively identify them as hers?</font>

137
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:58,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did this?</font>

138
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:02,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.</font>

139
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why my daughter?</font>

140
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there someone we can call</font>

141
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?</font>

142
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no more family.</font>

143
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">These bombers, will you catch them?</font>

144
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

145
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will they get punished?</font>

146
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:32,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they certainly will.</font>

147
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll let ourselves out.</font>

148
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:55,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.</font>

149
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:56,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been a long time, Liam.</font>

150
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:59,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.</font>

151
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:00,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Hugh?</font>

152
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we're all here,</font>

153
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:06,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?</font>

154
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they even part of the IRA?</font>

155
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?</font>

156
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:21,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.</font>

157
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:22,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I won't have it.</font>

158
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.</font>

159
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our mandate's to uphold that choice</font>

160
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.</font>

161
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we in agreement?</font>

162
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:35,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.</font>

163
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:36,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hotheads.</font>

164
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:40,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.</font>

165
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.</font>

166
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye.</font>

167
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long ago, when it was the only way.</font>

168
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did it give us?</font>

169
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:50,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">More graves than I care to remember.</font>

170
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:54,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.</font>

171
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:58,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!</font>

172
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?</font>

173
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Brits ID'd the explosive.</font>

174
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.</font>

175
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">They also used our code word.</font>

176
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means they have
a contact in our command.</font>

177
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:14,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe someone in this room.</font>

178
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to divide us,</font>

179
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.</font>

180
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I won't have it!</font>

181
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:29,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,</font>

182
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:30,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything verified,</font>

183
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.</font>

184
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:36,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.</font>

185
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">We check 'em, and if something's missing,</font>

186
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">we trace it back
to those who knew the location.</font>

187
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we deal with this internally.</font>

188
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless someone here's got a better idea.</font>

189
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we get in return?</font>

190
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:50,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace.</font>

191
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that so bad, Brennan?</font>

192
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:57,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you paid enough in family blood?</font>

193
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,</font>

194
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your full support and respect.</font>

195
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:07,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,</font>

196
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.</font>

197
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no fuckin' exceptions!</font>

198
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me.</font>

199
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV:</font>

200
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.</font>

201
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.</font>

202
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.</font>

203
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.</font>

204
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.</font>

205
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:49,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.</font>

206
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about phone calls?</font>

207
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,</font>

208
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone</font>

209
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to ID any call terminating</font>

210
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:58,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the time of the incident.</font>

211
00:18:58,842 --> 00:18:59,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Excuse me.</font>

212
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

213
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you.</font>

214
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:06,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.</font>

215
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Chinese man.
- What?</font>

216
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:11,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.</font>

217
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:13,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ. Tell him I'm busy.</font>

218
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, and he said he'd wait, again.</font>

219
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.</font>

220
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead</font>

221
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:27,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find those who killed your daughter.</font>

222
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're a difficult people to catch.</font>

223
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:36,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it may take some time.</font>

224
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to understand that.</font>

225
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.</font>

226
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, it's our top priority.</font>

227
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty thousand pound.</font>

228
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:58,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I have for the names of the bombers.</font>

229
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...</font>

230
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.</font>

231
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.</font>

232
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:16,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.</font>

233
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our work, not yours.</font>

234
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to be patient.</font>

235
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?</font>

236
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:35,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.</font>

237
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:38,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were born in Guangxi, China.</font>

238
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.</font>

239
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I work in Saigon after the war.</font>

240
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We escaped to Singapore.</font>

241
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we immigrate here.</font>

242
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had two daughters
before Fan.</font>

243
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:56,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both killed during the escape.</font>

244
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your wife?</font>

245
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she now?</font>

246
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died, giving birth to Fan.</font>

247
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm truly sorry for your loss.</font>

248
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:16,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.</font>

249
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:21,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.</font>

250
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

251
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I understand.</font>

252
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:37,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.</font>

253
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:51,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">After three weeks
of investigations,</font>

254
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:54,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.</font>

255
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">The public is looking for reassurance.</font>

256
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:00,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,</font>

257
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:03,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.</font>

258
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast</font>

259
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.</font>

260
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputy Minister Hennessy,</font>

261
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've publicly condemned the bombings.</font>

262
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein</font>

263
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a member of the IRA,</font>

264
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:18,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">you took part in similar events years ago.</font>

265
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then</font>

266
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what's happened in London recently?</font>

267
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:29,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.</font>

268
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">We needed to break the cycle,</font>

269
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we committed
to a political path which lead to...</font>

270
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made you tea.</font>

271
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:40,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if you say "hope,"</font>

272
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:43,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,</font>

273
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">returning to the bombings?</font>

274
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:50,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.</font>

275
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:53,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises...</font>

276
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't be like this anymore.</font>

277
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:56,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should eat something.</font>

278
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting you some noodles.</font>

279
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:06,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem</font>

280
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">rather than a political one.</font>

281
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:12,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">People look for scapegoats, for a way out.</font>

282
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:14,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for some, they are more than happy</font>

283
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.</font>

284
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.</font>

285
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:31,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the latest reaction
on social media?</font>

286
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same as before. Fear and anger.</font>

287
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:35,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anger directed at whom?</font>

288
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:37,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the Prime Minister on down.</font>

289
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.</font>

290
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:42,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.</font>

291
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?</font>

292
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:46,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've a call waitin' on Line Two.</font>

293
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.</font>

294
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:51,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.</font>

295
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:55,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does he want?
- His daughter was killed in the bombing.</font>

296
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.</font>

297
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He saw ya on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.</font>

298
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:03,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Civic duty. Take it and be done.</font>

299
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?</font>

300
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:15,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?</font>

301
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?</font>

302
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, you are the First Deputy Minister</font>

303
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.</font>

304
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.</font>

305
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.</font>

306
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then please tell me someone</font>

307
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.</font>

308
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.</font>

309
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.</font>

310
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are very powerful man.</font>

311
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.</font>

312
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not work for terrorists.</font>

313
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:57,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.</font>

314
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.</font>

315
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,</font>

316
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:04,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">because one end will bite.</font>

317
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.</font>

318
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:10,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good day.</font>

319
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:03,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

320
00:26:05,305 --> 00:26:07,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to stop this.</font>

321
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wasn't your fault.</font>

322
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">I failed them.</font>

323
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:23,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

324
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:26,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">The restaurant is now yours.</font>

325
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:30,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been a good friend to me, Lam.</font>

326
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more of this talk.</font>

327
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

328
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:43,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going home. I'm staying the night.
I will sleep on the couch.</font>

329
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:45,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on Monday,
I'm taking you to see someone.</font>

330
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone to help you.
But no more of this talk. OK?</font>

331
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:56,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quan!</font>

332
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been calling you
all night. Where were you?</font>

333
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:08,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you going to do?</font>

334
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">When will you come back?</font>

335
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:23,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a room?</font>

336
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:27,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are important documents
that we must have today.</font>

337
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:29,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,</font>

338
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange</font>

339
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.</font>

340
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, 329174-N for November.</font>

341
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.</font>

342
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good day.</font>

343
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes? May I help you?</font>

344
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.</font>

345
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:53,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.</font>

346
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who's been phoning.</font>

347
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I phoned many times.</font>

348
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.</font>

349
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.</font>

350
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best do as the lady says.</font>

351
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.</font>

352
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't take no for an answer.</font>

353
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:12,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just groceries.</font>

354
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:17,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go now, before we make ya.</font>

355
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:21,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. I'm wait.
- Right.</font>

356
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:30,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.</font>

357
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:33,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.</font>

358
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, take it off him.</font>

359
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:39,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?</font>

360
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him be.</font>

361
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:43,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I explained before...</font>

362
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know who the bombers are.</font>

363
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.</font>

364
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.</font>

365
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.</font>

366
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do not know who they are,</font>

367
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like you to please find out.</font>

368
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:09,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.</font>

369
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.</font>

370
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.</font>

371
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:18,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I serve the politics of both sides,</font>

372
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.</font>

373
00:31:22,753 --> 00:31:28,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.</font>

374
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:31,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?</font>

375
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:37,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.</font>

376
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:41,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.</font>

377
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will tell me who killed my child.</font>

378
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:47,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, I don't know.</font>

379
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:52,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will change your mind.</font>

380
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:59,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.</font>

381
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:16,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.</font>

382
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:29,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.</font>

383
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take her, take her.</font>

384
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.</font>

385
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:34,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

386
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?</font>

387
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

388
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:58,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.</font>

389
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:01,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one comes to mind.</font>

390
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:06,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.</font>

391
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:09,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.</font>

392
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:12,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?</font>

393
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:17,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.</font>

394
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.</font>

395
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:24,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.</font>

396
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

397
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him.</font>

398
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?</font>

399
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?</font>

400
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:46,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your fuckin' tree?</font>

401
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea who you're dealing with.</font>

402
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:49,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll soon find out.</font>

403
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:50,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the names.</font>

404
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:53,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.</font>

405
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:54,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll settle...</font>

406
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.</font>

407
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:04,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.</font>

408
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't be hard to find.</font>

409
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:09,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuckin' Chinaman.</font>

410
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uncle Liam? What's up?</font>

411
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be there.</font>

412
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:36,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!</font>

413
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:39,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move! She's wired to blow!</font>

414
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,</font>

415
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:23,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.</font>

416
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gives an extra kick.</font>

417
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not needed, but a nice touch.</font>

418
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:30,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crude, effective, and easy to spot.</font>

419
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, he wanted us to see it.</font>

420
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.</font>

421
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.</font>

422
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Micky.</font>

423
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found him.
A B&amp;B in Wellington Park.</font>

424
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They found him.
- Grab him.</font>

425
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.</font>

426
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:52,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for me. I'm on my way.</font>

427
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:56,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

428
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear your office was bombed.</font>

429
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:01,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.</font>

430
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.</font>

431
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:06,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all being taken care of.</font>

432
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:07,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd he do it?</font>

433
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.</font>

434
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not the only one of that mind.</font>

435
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.</font>

436
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.</font>

437
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.</font>

438
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.</font>

439
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:30,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.</font>

440
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:43,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Top floor on the right.</font>

441
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:52,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuckin' get him!</font>

442
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?</font>

443
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">An old man making fools
out of the lot of you</font>

444
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:26,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.</font>

445
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are four men. Four.</font>

446
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:30,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof</font>

447
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.</font>

448
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:33,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is goin' on?</font>

449
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:38,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.</font>

450
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:41,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

451
00:41:41,972 --> 00:41:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your things.</font>

452
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.</font>

453
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on through, he's expecting ya.</font>

454
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:58,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.</font>

455
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at ya.</font>

456
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:02,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?</font>

457
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.</font>

458
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how is New York treatin' ya?</font>

459
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:08,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.</font>

460
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.</font>

461
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:15,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">He set off a bomb in my office,</font>

462
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.</font>

463
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.</font>

464
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:28,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help with the London bombing.</font>

465
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any idea who's behind it yet?</font>

466
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:35,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all.</font>

467
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:38,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...</font>

468
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead women and kids
all over the news.</font>

469
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:41,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any fundraising now is impossible.</font>

470
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.</font>

471
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to go to London
and meet someone...</font>

472
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:51,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Richard Bromley in SO15.</font>

473
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:54,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">SO15?</font>

474
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:56,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,</font>

475
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:59,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.</font>

476
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:00,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why me?</font>

477
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.</font>

478
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:08,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.</font>

479
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:12,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,</font>

480
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go after one of our own, rogue or not,</font>

481
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:17,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">there'll be the devil to pay.</font>

482
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:21,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, can I count on you, Sean...</font>

483
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:23,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be discreet?</font>

484
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:26,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

485
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:14,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right this way, sir.</font>

486
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:15,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you very much.</font>

487
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:27,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took your time.</font>

488
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:31,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.</font>

489
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:39,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be back in a minute.</font>

490
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:40,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right here.</font>

491
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:55,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

492
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:25,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Morrison.</font>

493
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Bromley.</font>

494
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not responsible.
- Really?</font>

495
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.</font>

496
00:45:38,222 --> 00:45:40,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.</font>

497
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:42,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit</font>

498
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the loose you know nothing about?</font>

499
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:45,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I am.</font>

500
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Semtex?</font>

501
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:48,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're raiding our dumps.</font>

502
00:45:48,648 --> 00:45:50,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?</font>

503
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:52,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your code word?</font>

504
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:55,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.</font>

505
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:57,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?</font>

506
00:45:58,407 --> 00:45:59,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've a plan.</font>

507
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:02,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Different codes will be given
to each member of command.</font>

508
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:04,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,</font>

509
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:06,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll tell us which word they use.</font>

510
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:08,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.</font>

511
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else is involved in this plan?</font>

512
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam Hennessy.</font>

513
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.</font>

514
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.</font>

515
00:46:15,922 --> 00:46:18,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?</font>

516
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.</font>

517
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:24,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've one condition.</font>

518
00:46:27,057 --> 00:46:29,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.</font>

519
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we take them down. Not you.</font>

520
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:35,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is non-negotiable.</font>

521
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:01,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found some plastic bags in his room.</font>

522
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:04,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,</font>

523
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:08,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.</font>

524
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:10,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much damage can he do?</font>

525
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:13,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.</font>

526
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:14,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

527
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:17,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.</font>

528
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.</font>

529
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:22,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be safe here.</font>

530
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:27,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. I wouldn't count on it.</font>

531
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Benny!</font>

532
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:49,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

533
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it! Move it!</font>

534
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:09,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.</font>

535
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:12,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get more men from Belfast.</font>

536
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:15,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.</font>

537
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:30,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's another warning, Liam?</font>

538
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:32,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. Nothing I can't handle.</font>

539
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">First Belfast, now here.</font>

540
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">How in God's name
are you handling anything?</font>

541
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem's being dealt with.</font>

542
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is destroying our farmhouse,</font>

543
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:45,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?</font>

544
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:48,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, you can be so pompous sometimes.</font>

545
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:51,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.</font>

546
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:52,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure that's a good idea.</font>

547
00:51:52,554 --> 00:51:54,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.</font>

548
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:57,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,</font>

549
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's you he's after, not me.</font>

550
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:01,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,</font>

551
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:04,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume he knows about Keri's flat.</font>

552
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not worth the risk.</font>

553
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:07,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.</font>

554
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:13,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,</font>

555
00:52:13,574 --> 00:52:14,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">and other things, too.</font>

556
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:17,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">But those days are gone.</font>

557
00:52:50,273 --> 00:52:52,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.</font>

558
00:52:53,485 --> 00:52:56,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.</font>

559
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:58,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks good.</font>

560
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:02,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.</font>

561
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:03,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it's turned on?</font>

562
00:53:04,536 --> 00:53:07,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.</font>

563
00:53:07,246 --> 00:53:08,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any idea which plane yet?</font>

564
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:12,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.</font>

565
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:15,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.</font>

566
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Code word has changed...</font>

567
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">As of tonight.</font>

568
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:29,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">My news editor's a complete twat.</font>

569
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:32,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.</font>

570
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:34,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes perfect sense.</font>

571
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:37,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?</font>

572
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.</font>

Husband's Transgender Lover."</font>

574
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:49,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some serious news you're writing there.</font>

575
00:53:49,702 --> 00:53:52,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if it pays, I'll write it.</font>

576
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:54,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.</font>

577
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, what do you do?
- Wealth management.</font>

578

00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ian.</font>

580
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:16,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
I'll call if we need more.</font>

581
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:19,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.</font>

582
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:23,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.</font>

the fellas who've been up all night.</font>

584
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:26,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it enough to secure the farm?</font>

585
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:30,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.</font>

586
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.</font>

587
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:35,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, yeah.
- That's completely unnecessary.</font>

588
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:38,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.</font>

589
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can manage this, all right?</font>

590
00:54:40,038 --> 00:54:41,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll not be debating this!</font>

591
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:44,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.</font>

592
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:45,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're leaving...</font>

593
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:05,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him to the hospital.</font>

594
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:08,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get Mary to the airport. Go.
- Right.</font>

595
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:17,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.</font>

596
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needed a line of sight.</font>

597
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those woods, that's where I'd be.</font>

598
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:27,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go.
- Sean! Mick! Get in the car.</font>

599
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:28,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

600
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Go, go, go!</font>

601
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:01,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.</font>

602
00:56:52,364 --> 00:56:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Names!</font>

603
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:22,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

604
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:25,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.</font>

605
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:27,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it so hard?</font>

606
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:30,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's ahead of us every step of the way.</font>

607
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need more men.</font>

608
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:34,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need 100 more men, at least.</font>

609
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:37,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.</font>

610
00:57:40,322 --> 00:57:43,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,</font>

611
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:44,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">and beat him at his own game.</font>

612
00:57:46,204 --> 00:57:47,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">My nephew?</font>

613
00:57:47,704 --> 00:57:50,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. If you can spare him.</font>

614
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:20,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

615
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's Keri? Where is she?</font>

616
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:31,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out.</font>

617
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:34,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.</font>

618
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:37,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you a restaurant in mind?</font>

619
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't given it much thought.</font>

620
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?</font>

621
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few personal matters.</font>

622
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad I made the list.</font>

623
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:55,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm. I think that works.</font>

624
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

625
00:59:22,664 --> 00:59:24,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've gotta be kiddin'.</font>

626
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:32,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Liam?
- Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.</font>

627
00:59:33,257 --> 00:59:34,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pass it on.</font>

628
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:37,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.</font>

629
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:40,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quan hit us again.</font>

630
00:59:41,472 --> 00:59:43,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.</font>

631
00:59:44,016 --> 00:59:45,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kavanagh and the boys went after him.</font>

632
00:59:45,893 --> 00:59:50,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.</font>

633
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:53,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.</font>

634
00:59:53,442 --> 00:59:54,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which brings me to the point.</font>

635
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:58,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?</font>

636
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.</font>

637
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:14,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. How'd he sound?</font>

638
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worried.</font>

639
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a lot going on.</font>

640
01:00:20,173 --> 01:00:22,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.</font>

641
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:24,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">And politically, so's he.</font>

642
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:28,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he'll find them?</font>

643
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:30,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if there's another blast.</font>

644
01:00:33,101 --> 01:00:35,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">The code word will lead us to
who's running them.</font>

645
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:37,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's finished.
The code word won't save him.</font>

646
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the Council needs is new blood...</font>

647
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:44,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone stronger, like you.</font>

648
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:47,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's afraid to use his power.</font>

649
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:51,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.</font>

650
01:00:56,414 --> 01:00:59,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.</font>

651
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:02,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam found out who killed him.</font>

652
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:07,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">A UVF death squad. Four men.</font>

653
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:13,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.</font>

654
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:14,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he said no.</font>

655
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the time for revenge is past.</font>

656
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:22,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, my Patrick is dead and buried,</font>

657
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:26,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,</font>

658
01:01:26,106 --> 01:01:28,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">taking classes at the open university.</font>

659
01:01:29,568 --> 01:01:33,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not right. It's not.</font>

660
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh McGrath's here.</font>

661
01:04:21,847 --> 01:04:23,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you're checking my dumps.</font>

662
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:27,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.</font>

663
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:29,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four came up short. Two were yours.</font>

664
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:31,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten kilos of Semtex missing.</font>

665
01:04:31,898 --> 01:04:35,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.</font>

666
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:36,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were clear in that. Remember?</font>

667
01:04:36,902 --> 01:04:38,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were at the meeting.</font>

668
01:04:38,695 --> 01:04:40,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.</font>

669
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:44,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.</font>

670
01:04:47,286 --> 01:04:50,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?</font>

671
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:57,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?</font>

672
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust, or fear?</font>

673
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your case, mostly fear.</font>

674
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.</font>

675
01:05:07,512 --> 01:05:11,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.</font>

676
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Chinaman isn't helping matters,</font>

677
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:14,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.</font>

678
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:16,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How much do you know?
- Plenty.</font>

679
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.</font>

680
01:05:19,273 --> 01:05:22,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.</font>

681
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:25,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.</font>

682
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:29,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.</font>

683
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?</font>

684
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:34,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bombing.</font>

685
01:05:35,996 --> 01:05:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.</font>

686
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Encouragement"?</font>

687
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">They kill civilians by the buckets.</font>

688
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:47,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.</font>

689
01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:48,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Brits are on the ropes.</font>

690
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:52,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.</font>

691
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.</font>

692
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.</font>

693
01:05:58,516 --> 01:06:02,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.</font>

694
01:06:02,186 --> 01:06:03,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's the way it has to be.</font>

695
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:06,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.</font>

696
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:10,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.</font>

697
01:06:10,985 --> 01:06:15,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.</font>

698
01:06:15,532 --> 01:06:17,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,</font>

699
01:06:17,824 --> 01:06:19,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">to prop up your weakness in the ranks.</font>

700
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:24,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.</font>

701
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:29,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.</font>

702
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.</font>

703
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:35,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.</font>

704
01:06:35,465 --> 01:06:37,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those days are long gone!</font>

705
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not what I heard a few months ago.</font>

706
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:47,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.</font>

707
01:06:49,728 --> 01:06:52,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?</font>

708
01:06:53,106 --> 01:06:54,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You question my loyalty?</font>

709
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.</font>

710
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:03,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,</font>

711
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:05,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">not profiting off a divided one.</font>

712
01:07:05,242 --> 01:07:08,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.</font>

713
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:10,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,</font>

714
01:07:10,954 --> 01:07:15,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.</font>

715
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:17,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the Liam I once knew.</font>

716
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want the old me, huh?</font>

717
01:07:19,672 --> 01:07:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?</font>

718
01:07:22,423 --> 01:07:23,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then, hear this.</font>

719
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:25,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,</font>

720
01:07:25,927 --> 01:07:28,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.</font>

721
01:07:30,556 --> 01:07:33,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. I'm going now.</font>

722
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be at my farm if you need me.</font>

723
01:07:36,813 --> 01:07:39,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">And take care of that Committee issue.</font>

724
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:43,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?</font>

725
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

726
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:58,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?</font>

727
01:07:58,164 --> 01:08:00,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No one, but Murphy.</font>

728
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.</font>

729
01:08:03,753 --> 01:08:05,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know how.</font>

730
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:26,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a day, Charlie.</font>

731
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:30,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a day. Come on now, let's go.</font>

732
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:37,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Charlie, up you get.</font>

733
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:39,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie.</font>

734
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed my dog?</font>

735
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:14,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dog's fine. Just sleeping.</font>

736
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:17,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

737
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm wearing a bomb.</font>

738
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:32,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.</font>

739
01:09:32,497 --> 01:09:33,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, give me the names.</font>

740
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:37,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.</font>

741
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.</font>

742
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:41,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying! Who killed my daughter?</font>

743
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:44,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.</font>

744
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:53,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?</font>

745
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?</font>

746
01:09:58,479 --> 01:09:59,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Semtex-H.</font>

747
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:03,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.</font>

748
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:04,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good for bombs and traps.</font>

749
01:10:04,525 --> 01:10:06,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In Vietnam?
- Yes.</font>

750
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many American people died by Semtex-H.</font>

751
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:12,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.</font>

752
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:15,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ironic.</font>

753
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:20,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've read your history.
We both know about war.</font>

754
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.</font>

755
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:29,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!</font>

756
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:31,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Almighty God, I don't know!</font>

757
01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:34,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.</font>

758
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,</font>

759
01:10:37,139 --> 01:10:40,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.</font>

760
01:10:41,725 --> 01:10:43,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've changed that code word.</font>

761
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, when they use it, I'll know.</font>

762
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:54,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one day.</font>

763
01:10:57,282 --> 01:10:58,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they don't set off a bomb by then?</font>

764
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:01,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty-four hours.</font>

765
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:09,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.</font>

766
01:11:12,212 --> 01:11:13,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">We missed it the first time...</font>

767
01:11:14,256 --> 01:11:16,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR:</font>

768
01:11:16,298 --> 01:11:19,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.</font>

769
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:22,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there, look, the back of his hand.</font>

770
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.</font>

771
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:26,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're running comparatives now.</font>

772
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.</font>

773
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on.</font>

774
01:11:46,743 --> 01:11:47,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

775
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:48,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

776
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:57,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?</font>

777
01:12:57,221 --> 01:12:59,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.</font>

778
01:13:00,057 --> 01:13:02,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.</font>

779
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Has Bromley phoned?
- No. Not yet.</font>

780
01:13:04,895 --> 01:13:07,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.</font>

781
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:10,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.</font>

782
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:11,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good man.</font>

783
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:30,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hennessy.</font>

784
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:34,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?</font>

785
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it wasn't them.</font>

786
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Press Association took the call.</font>

787
01:13:38,801 --> 01:13:41,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation</font>

788
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:42,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the Brits and no more code words.</font>

789
01:13:43,262 --> 01:13:45,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.</font>

790
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:48,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.</font>

791
01:13:48,143 --> 01:13:51,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.</font>

792
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:56,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.</font>

793
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:59,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.</font>

794
01:13:59,485 --> 01:14:02,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.</font>

795
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call the moment I have something.</font>

796
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">It better be soon,</font>

797
01:14:07,534 --> 01:14:10,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.</font>

798
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:16,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bus now.</font>

799
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:19,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.</font>

800
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:20,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

801
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.</font>

802
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've just come
from Downing Street.</font>

803
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The PM will consider the pardons,</font>

804
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.</font>

805
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:33,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how in God's name do I do that?</font>

806
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find a way.</font>

807
01:14:35,225 --> 01:14:38,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.</font>

808
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Belfast will erupt.</font>

809
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.</font>

810
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:46,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.</font>

811
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.</font>

812
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:49,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have my cell at all times.</font>

813
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:12,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was London? Is Mary OK?</font>

814
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said to keep an eye on her,</font>

815
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.</font>

816
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?</font>

817
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:27,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had no idea I was there.</font>

818
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your nephew turns up.</font>

819
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">He spent two hours in her room.</font>

820
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:40,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.</font>

821
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:41,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after he goes,</font>

822
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:44,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary comes down,</font>

823
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:47,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.</font>

824
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:11,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's done.</font>

825
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:21,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.</font>

826
01:16:21,695 --> 01:16:23,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?</font>

827
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:25,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">The internal clock.</font>

828
01:16:25,283 --> 01:16:27,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll input the time
once we know the flight.</font>

829
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.</font>

830
01:16:29,661 --> 01:16:33,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.</font>

831
01:16:33,331 --> 01:16:35,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect. What about our mule?</font>

832
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sara just confirmed he's going.</font>

833
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.</font>

834
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:42,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,</font>

835
01:16:43,047 --> 01:16:44,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">age 29, from Belfast.</font>

836
01:16:45,341 --> 01:16:48,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.</font>

837
01:16:48,886 --> 01:16:50,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did two months in Hydebank.</font>

838
01:16:51,055 --> 01:16:54,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.</font>

839
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:55,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a hit.</font>

840
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:01,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.</font>

841
01:17:01,648 --> 01:17:04,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.</font>

842
01:17:08,445 --> 01:17:09,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the other two with him?</font>

843
01:17:09,822 --> 01:17:11,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was about to get to them,
Minister.</font>

844
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:14,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.</font>

845
01:17:21,414 --> 01:17:22,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

846
01:17:22,832 --> 01:17:24,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mole's Hugh McGrath.</font>

847
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear me, Hennessy?</font>

848
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:30,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure now?</font>

849
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:31,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite.</font>

850
01:17:32,675 --> 01:17:36,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.</font>

851
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:39,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.</font>

852
01:17:40,765 --> 01:17:42,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?</font>

853
01:17:44,019 --> 01:17:45,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know O'Reilly.</font>

854
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:48,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen McGrath.</font>

855
01:17:48,355 --> 01:17:50,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help you with McGrath.</font>

856
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.</font>

857
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:57,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm watching him coming up your drive.</font>

858
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's cut the shit.</font>

859
01:18:00,324 --> 01:18:03,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.</font>

860
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:06,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.</font>

861
01:18:06,954 --> 01:18:09,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him</font>

862
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:11,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">will sink your career...</font>

863
01:18:11,835 --> 01:18:13,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time for good.</font>

864
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:16,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or?</font>

865
01:18:16,171 --> 01:18:18,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.</font>

866
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:20,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Names and locations of everyone.</font>

867
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:23,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.</font>

868
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.</font>

869
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:29,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim.</font>

870
01:18:34,646 --> 01:18:38,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.</font>

871
01:18:47,992 --> 01:18:49,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your phone.</font>

872
01:18:49,452 --> 01:18:51,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.</font>

873
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:55,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.</font>

874
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A London bus, for Christ sake!
- Now hold on.</font>

875
01:18:59,837 --> 01:19:01,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even fuckin' warnings!</font>

876
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:03,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sixteen dead.</font>

877
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath</font>

878
01:19:06,216 --> 01:19:07,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get your war back on.</font>

879
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plan had no balls.</font>

880
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:12,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.</font>

881
01:19:12,596 --> 01:19:14,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.</font>

882
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">By killing women and children?</font>

883
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:19,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't restrain yourself.</font>

884
01:19:19,395 --> 01:19:21,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never could. Well, it's over.</font>

885
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:25,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their names, aliases, and location.</font>

886
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:28,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I can't do that.</font>

887
01:19:28,778 --> 01:19:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's me being nice.</font>

888
01:19:30,613 --> 01:19:33,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now write. And it better match
what I already know.</font>

889
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!</font>

890
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:39,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used me.</font>

891
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:42,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.</font>

892
01:19:42,957 --> 01:19:45,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a disgrace to the cause.</font>

893
01:19:47,752 --> 01:19:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four men and a woman.</font>

894
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:54,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maggie Dunn?</font>

895
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:58,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. You call her that.</font>

896
01:19:59,014 --> 01:20:01,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sara Mackay's her real name.</font>

897
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">She works for you?</font>

898
01:20:06,395 --> 01:20:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody right.</font>

899
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:09,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checks and balances.</font>

900
01:20:12,984 --> 01:20:18,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,</font>

901
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,</font>

902
01:20:22,993 --> 01:20:26,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">she will lead them straight back to you.</font>

903
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:28,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so easy anymore now, is it?</font>

904
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:32,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.</font>

905
01:20:33,586 --> 01:20:35,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know that can't happen.</font>

906
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:40,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me up to the Brits?</font>

907
01:20:41,259 --> 01:20:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tout bastard!</font>

908
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:46,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave yourself up.</font>

909
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,</font>

910
01:20:50,935 --> 01:20:52,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.</font>

911
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:55,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.</font>

912
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:02,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke every rule, Hughie.</font>

913
01:21:03,988 --> 01:21:08,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.</font>

914
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:14,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">A final thing.</font>

915
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:17,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife?</font>

916
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:20,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about her?</font>

917
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:31,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">She hates you because of her brother.</font>

918
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so she reached out to me.</font>

919
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:37,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yes, I helped her...</font>

920
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she helped me.</font>

921
01:21:58,161 --> 01:22:00,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Bromley.</font>

922
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:02,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your names.</font>

923
01:22:12,548 --> 01:22:14,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.</font>

924
01:22:16,886 --> 01:22:17,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you cum?</font>

925
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:21,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.</font>

926
01:23:06,512 --> 01:23:09,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.</font>

927
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to get used to it.</font>

928
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:17,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Practice, practice, practice.</font>

929
01:23:27,573 --> 01:23:28,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm close.</font>

930
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:32,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.</font>

931
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:37,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.</font>

932
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:41,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.</font>

933
01:23:41,087 --> 01:23:43,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.</font>

934
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:48,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either way, Sean, you end this, now.</font>

935
01:23:48,717 --> 01:23:50,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You hear me?
- Understood.</font>

936
01:25:25,011 --> 01:25:26,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why you're still alive?</font>

937
01:25:27,014 --> 01:25:29,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want the names?</font>

938
01:25:30,975 --> 01:25:35,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.</font>

939
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:39,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five names and their location in London.</font>

940
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:43,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.</font>

941
01:25:44,695 --> 01:25:46,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.</font>

942
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:49,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fought in the army.</font>

943
01:25:50,242 --> 01:25:53,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.</font>

944
01:25:54,662 --> 01:25:55,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two tours, Special Forces.</font>

945
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?</font>

946
01:26:02,837 --> 01:26:04,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fought for the regiment.</font>

947
01:26:05,965 --> 01:26:09,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.</font>

948
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:12,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family?</font>

949
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">A brother.</font>

950
01:26:16,057 --> 01:26:17,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest have passed away.</font>

951
01:26:58,095 --> 01:27:00,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

952
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a seat, Sean.</font>

953
01:27:09,896 --> 01:27:13,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.</font>

954
01:27:13,524 --> 01:27:16,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye. Quan got the drop on me.</font>

955
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:20,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.</font>

956
01:27:21,614 --> 01:27:23,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the bombers called in about the bus,</font>

957
01:27:24,784 --> 01:27:26,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">they didn't use a code word,</font>

958
01:27:27,162 --> 01:27:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">because someone tipped them off.</font>

959
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:33,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.</font>

960
01:27:34,502 --> 01:27:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and me.</font>

961
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.</font>

962
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:44,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I told you I had Murphy stay</font>

963
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">and watch Mary in London?</font>

964
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">My own flesh and blood.</font>

965
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:53,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liam, I'm so sorry.</font>

966
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:56,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.</font>

967
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:01,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I wanna know is, what was discussed</font>

968
01:28:01,775 --> 01:28:05,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?</font>

969
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?</font>

970
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:08,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Never.</font>

971
01:28:09,992 --> 01:28:12,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.</font>

972
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,</font>

973
01:28:14,537 --> 01:28:15,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she never let on about McGrath.</font>

974
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?</font>

975
01:28:18,123 --> 01:28:20,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.</font>

976
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:23,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She thought they wouldn't be of use.
- So, she steered the conversation?</font>

977
01:28:23,755 --> 01:28:25,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes, I guess she did.</font>

978
01:28:25,338 --> 01:28:28,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. A good manipulator, she is.</font>

979
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:29,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, she told the bombers?</font>

980
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told McGrath, McGrath told them.</font>

981
01:28:32,804 --> 01:28:34,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thick as thieves, they were.</font>

982
01:28:35,055 --> 01:28:37,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.</font>

983
01:28:39,185 --> 01:28:40,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">She used you.</font>

984
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Liam, I...
- Shut up!</font>

985
01:28:55,573 --> 01:28:57,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bury that pig in the sow-pen.</font>

986
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:01,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after that,
I have one final task for you.</font>

987
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:04,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when that's done...</font>

988
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">go back to New York, son.</font>

989
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:38,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

990

and unsighted to you. Copy.</font>

994
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:03,260

01:30:43,545 --> 01:30:44,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's done.</font>

1002

1008
01:31:36,132 --> 01:31:37,132

1009
01:31:38,135 --> 01:31:40,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.</font>

1010
01:31:41,012 --> 01:31:43,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know what you
went through. All right?</font>

1011
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?</font>

1012
01:31:45,475 --> 01:31:47,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.</font>

1013
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,061

1028
01:33:41,787 --> 01:33:44,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,</font>

1029
01:33:44,497 --> 01:33:47,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.</font>

1030
01:33:47,667 --> 01:33:50,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our gas works fine. There's no problem.</font>

1031
01:33:51,503 --> 01:33:53,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.</font>

1032
01:33:53,631 --> 01:33:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.</font>

1033
01:34:00,804 --> 01:34:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite important, Mr. Upton.</font>

1034
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:06,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.</font>

1035
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:09,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Just a second.</font>

1036
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:24,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. I will be very fast.</font>

1038
01:34:32,332 --> 01:34:33,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

1039
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see the boiler, please?</font>

1040
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?</font>

1041
01:35:07,195 --> 01:35:08,279

<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Echo?</font>

1050
01:37:54,052 --> 01:37:55,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's alive, under control.</font>

1051

01:38:06,773 --> 01:38:08,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this, eh? Your next bomb?</font>

1054
01:38:08,565 --> 01:38:09,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go fuck yourself.</font>

1055
01:38:14,738 --> 01:38:16,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk, you rotten slag!</font>

1056
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late.</font>

1057
01:38:27,957 --> 01:38:30,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.</font>

1058
01:38:30,586 --> 01:38:34,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that? A plane? Which plane?</font>

1059
01:38:34,881 --> 01:38:36,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which plane?</font>

1060
01:38:36,716 --> 01:38:38,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open her shirt.</font>

1061
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,057
