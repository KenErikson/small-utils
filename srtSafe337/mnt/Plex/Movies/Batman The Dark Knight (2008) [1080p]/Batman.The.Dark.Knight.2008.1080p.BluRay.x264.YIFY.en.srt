1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?</font>

2
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:51,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.</font>

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.</font>

4
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.</font>

5
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?</font>

6
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?</font>

7
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.</font>

8
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!</font>

9
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, hands up, heads down!</font>

10
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.</font>

11
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:27,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I said, hands up!
- No!</font>

12
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the silent alarm.</font>

13
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:31,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there it goes.</font>

14
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads down!</font>

15
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.</font>

16
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!</font>

17
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.</font>

18
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.</font>

19
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down! Down!</font>

20
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down! I said, stay down there!</font>

21
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...</font>

22
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">other than holding on for dear life.</font>

23
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ground! Stay on the ground!</font>

24
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:22,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!</font>

25
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

26
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have any idea
who you're stealing from?</font>

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?</font>

28
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...?</font>

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you learn to count?</font>

30
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:07,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.</font>

31
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of bank does that?</font>

32
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.</font>

33
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:12,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the alarm guy?</font>

34
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.</font>

35
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">One less share, right?</font>

36
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny, he told me something similar.</font>

37
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">He what? No! No!</font>

38
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lot of money.</font>

39
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.</font>

40
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:44,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.</font>

41
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.</font>

42
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:50,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bus driver?</font>

43
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">What bus driver?</font>

44
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">School's out. Time to go.</font>

45
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy's not getting up, is he?</font>

46
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lot of money.</font>

47
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:11,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to the rest of the guys?</font>

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're smart, huh?</font>

49
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy that hired youse...</font>

50
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll just do the same to you.</font>

51
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:29,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.</font>

52
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honor...</font>

53
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">respect.</font>

54
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?</font>

55
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you believe in?</font>

56
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:41,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...</font>

57
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">stranger.</font>

58
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:29,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.</font>

59
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When are you gonna start?
I already have.</font>

60
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:33,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like this Batman.</font>

61
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.</font>

62
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?</font>

63
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.</font>

64
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.</font>

65
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.</font>

66
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:52,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">The investigation is ongoing.</font>

67
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.</font>

68
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...</font>

69
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?</font>

70
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.</font>

71
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checked her back into the hospital.</font>

72
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

73
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:14,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.</font>

74
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like reminding everybody
he's out there.</font>

75
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:17,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't he come?</font>

76
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:20,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hopefully...</font>

77
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he's busy.</font>

78
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:41,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we bring dogs.</font>

79
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My little princes.
Please.</font>

80
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:47,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.</font>

81
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what your drugs
do to my customers.</font>

82
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buyer beware.</font>

83
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:56,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you my compound
would take you places.</font>

84
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.</font>

85
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:01,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">My business, repeat customers.</font>

86
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't like
what I have to offer...</font>

87
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can buy from someone else.</font>

88
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:08,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.</font>

89
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:15,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dogs are hungry.</font>

90
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity there's only one of you.</font>

91
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...?
That's not him.</font>

92
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:37,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loose the dogs!</font>

93
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's more like it.</font>

94
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let me find you out here again.</font>

95
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.</font>

96
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my diagnosis.</font>

97
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:29,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?</font>

98
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not wearing hockey pads.</font>

99
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody back now!</font>

100
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't resist showing us his face.</font>

101
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he hiding under that makeup?</font>

102
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?</font>

103
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him again. Who are the others?</font>

104
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:07,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another bunch of smalltimers.</font>

105
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the marked bills I gave you.</font>

106
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.</font>

107
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.</font>

108
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.</font>

109
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:22,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.</font>

110
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about this Joker guy?</font>

111
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:27,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.</font>

112
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.</font>

113
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.</font>

114
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he's as stubborn as you are.</font>

115
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:22,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.</font>

116
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...</font>

117
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">for not sleeping in a mansion.</font>

118
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:31,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.</font>

119
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.</font>

120
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.</font>

121
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">My armor.</font>

122
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:44,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.</font>

123
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.</font>

124
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:49,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.</font>

125
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:52,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh?
- It was a big dog.</font>

126
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:56,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.</font>

127
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:58,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?</font>

128
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:01,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...</font>

129
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I said I wanted
to inspire people.</font>

130
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

131
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">But things have improved.</font>

132
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:10,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the new district attorney.</font>

133
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:12,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am, closely.</font>

134
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to know if he can be trusted.</font>

135
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?</font>

136
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:25,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.</font>

137
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:29,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.</font>

138
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you ever took one, I might.</font>

139
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:35,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know your limits, Master Wayne.</font>

140
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman has no limits.</font>

141
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.</font>

142
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:44,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?</font>

143
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."</font>

144
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.</font>

145
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably.</font>

146
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late, folks.</font>

147
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?</font>

148
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,207

- Well, then...</font>

150
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.</font>

151
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:16,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?</font>

152
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.</font>

153
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.</font>

154
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't. I make my own luck.</font>

155
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.</font>

156
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.</font>

157
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:39,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.</font>

158
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...</font>

159
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:44,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.</font>

160
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that man in this courtroom today?</font>

161
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.</font>

162
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was me.</font>

163
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:01,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...</font>

164
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:05,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.</font>

165
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:10,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.</font>

166
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Order.
- Permission to treat...</font>

167
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">the witness as hostile?
- Granted.</font>

168
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!</font>

public servant, Mr. Maroni...</font>

171
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recommend you buy American.</font>

172
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.</font>

173
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.</font>

174
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:42,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.</font>

175
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:45,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.</font>

176
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.</font>

177
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.</font>

178
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:51,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you know...</font>

179
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:55,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.</font>

180
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:58,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.</font>

181
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:03,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.</font>

182
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:15,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear you got a hell of a right cross.</font>

183
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shame Sal's going to walk.</font>

184
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:24,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.</font>

185
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lightly irradiated bills.</font>

186
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?</font>

187
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">We liaise with various agencies...</font>

188
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.</font>

189
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:42,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.</font>

190
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?</font>

191
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...</font>

192
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.</font>

193
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...</font>

194
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the Mob
is still getting its money out.</font>

195
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.</font>

196
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.</font>

197
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bold.</font>

198
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna count me in?</font>

199
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:10,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.</font>

200
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like that you got
your own special unit...</font>

201
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.</font>

202
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...</font>

203
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be working alone.</font>

204
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get political points
for being an idealist.</font>

205
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do the best I can with what I have.</font>

206
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:32,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...</font>

207
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">without telling me what we're after.</font>

208
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can give you the names of the banks.</font>

209
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a start.</font>

210
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.</font>

211
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.</font>

212
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.</font>

213
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:52,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.</font>

214
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't know about that.</font>

215
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.</font>

216
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:03,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.</font>

217
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Mr. Lau...</font>

218
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I speak for the rest of the board...</font>

219
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:12,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.</font>

220
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:20,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...</font>

221
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, frankly, this is embarrassing.</font>

222
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.</font>

223
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.</font>

224
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's done.</font>

225
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">The numbers are solid.</font>

226
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do them again.</font>

227
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?</font>

228
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another long night?</font>

229
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.</font>

230
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not convinced.</font>

231
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.</font>

232
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">His revenue stream
must be off the books...</font>

233
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe even illegal.</font>

234
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Cancel the deal.</font>

235
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">You already knew.</font>

236
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just needed a closer look at their books.</font>

237
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything else you can trouble me for?</font>

238
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:06,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a new suit.</font>

239
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:08,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.</font>

240
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:12,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.</font>

241
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:15,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna be able to turn your head.</font>

242
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.</font>

243
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:19,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see what I can do.</font>

244
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.</font>

245
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to tell them
I work for the government.</font>

246
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Health inspector's...</font>

247
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">not afraid to pull strings.</font>

248
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel. Fancy that.</font>

249
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:36,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.</font>

250
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:38,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.</font>

251
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:44,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.</font>

252
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:47,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?</font>

253
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.</font>

254
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.</font>

255
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:55,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I certainly hope not.</font>

256
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:59,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.</font>

257
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they should. I own the place.</font>

258
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?</font>

259
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.</font>

260
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:09,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?</font>

261
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is...? Heh-heh.</font>

262
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Palisades? Sure.</font>

263
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...</font>

264
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">where your jurisdiction ends.</font>

265
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:22,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.</font>

266
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.</font>

267
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...</font>

268
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">not a man who thinks
he's above the law.</font>

269
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who appointed the Batman?</font>

270
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:35,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.</font>

271
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:37,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is a democracy, Harvey.</font>

272
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">When their enemies were at the gates...</font>

273
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:43,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.</font>

274
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.</font>

275
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...</font>

276
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:50,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">to protect the republic
was named Caesar...</font>

277
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.</font>

278
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You either die a hero...</font>

279
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.</font>

280
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:02,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.</font>

281
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.</font>

282
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone like you, Mr. Dent?</font>

283
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe. If I'm up to it.</font>

284
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:16,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?</font>

285
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:21,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.</font>

286
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:28,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.</font>

287
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.</font>

288
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't understand.</font>

289
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:36,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">One fundraiser with my pals...</font>

290
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll never need another cent.</font>

291
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this?</font>

292
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:00,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.</font>

293
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:03,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">A relatively small amount, 68 million.</font>

294
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:06,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's stupid enough to steal from us?</font>

295
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:10,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.</font>

296
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not the problem. He's a nobody.</font>

297
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:16,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.</font>

298
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...</font>

299
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:22,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...</font>

300
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and are planning to
seize your funds today.</font>

301
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...</font>

302
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:33,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your only option.
So, what are you proposing?</font>

303
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.</font>

304
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.</font>

305
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:43,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...</font>

306
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:45,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">everyone's money would be at stake.</font>

307
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">What stop them getting to you?</font>

308
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...</font>

309
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:54,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.</font>

310
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">How soon can you move the money?</font>

311
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already have.</font>

312
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.</font>

313
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rest assured, your money is safe.</font>

314
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:18,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.</font>

315
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought my jokes were bad.</font>

316
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.</font>

317
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:25,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a magic trick?</font>

318
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.</font>

319
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:34,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ta-da!</font>

320
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...</font>

321
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gone.</font>

322
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.</font>

323
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.</font>

324
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to hear proposition.</font>

325
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:54,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's wind the clocks back a year.</font>

326
00:23:54,494 --> 00:24:00,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.</font>

327
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what happened?</font>

328
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:07,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your balls drop off? Hm?</font>

329
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, a guy like me...</font>

330
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:12,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A freak.
Damn right.</font>

331
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guy like me... Look, listen.</font>

332
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:20,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...</font>

333
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.</font>

334
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.</font>

335
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Batman.</font>

336
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:36,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.</font>

337
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dent, he's just the beginning.</font>

338
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:45,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as for the television's
so-called plan...</font>

339
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman has no jurisdiction.</font>

340
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:50,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll find him and make him squeal.</font>

341
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the squealers when I see them...</font>

342
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:55,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">and...</font>

343
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you propose?</font>

344
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:00,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.</font>

345
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?</font>

346
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:07,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're good at something,
never do it for free.</font>

347
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much you want?</font>

348
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, half.</font>

349
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.</font>

350
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not.</font>

351
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't deal with this now...</font>

352
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">soon...</font>

353
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:31,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.</font>

354
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough from the clown!</font>

355
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:36,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...</font>

356
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:39,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!
this out of proportion.</font>

357
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:42,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?</font>

358
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.</font>

359
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five hundred grand for this clown dead.</font>

360
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:49,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.</font>

361
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...</font>

362
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:57,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?</font>

363
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's my card.</font>

364
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-mm.</font>

365
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a hard man to reach.</font>

366
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.</font>

367
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:31,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.</font>

368
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.</font>

369
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...</font>

370
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">My office?</font>

371
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...</font>

372
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.</font>

373
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:50,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.</font>

374
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need Lau back...</font>

375
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:59,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.</font>

376
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?</font>

377
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:03,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get him to sing.</font>

378
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going after the Mob's life savings.</font>

379
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things will get ugly.</font>

380
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:10,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.</font>

381
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:12,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will you get him back, any...?</font>

382
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">He does that.</font>

383
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:20,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.</font>

384
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:23,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.</font>

385
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with a phone call?</font>

386
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:29,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.</font>

387
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, for high-altitude jumps...</font>

388
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.</font>

389
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:39,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...</font>

390
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.</font>

391
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about getting back into the plane?</font>

392
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:49,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.</font>

393
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.</font>

394
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...</font>

395
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.</font>

396
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We could look into that.
- Yeah.</font>

397
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Now...</font>

398
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...</font>

399
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">tri-weave fibers for flexibility.</font>

400
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.</font>

401
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?</font>

402
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.</font>

403
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:25,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.</font>

404
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:28,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?</font>

405
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:30,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will it hold up against dogs?</font>

406
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?</font>

407
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should do fine against cats.</font>

408
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:39,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found one in Arizona.</font>

409
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:42,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...</font>

410
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he takes cash.</font>

411
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.</font>

412
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.</font>

413
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.</font>

414
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:13,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe this is your plane, sir.</font>

415
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:20,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?</font>

416
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:25,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."</font>

417
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.</font>

418
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">They brought the body.</font>

419
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:01,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, dead, that's 500.</font>

420
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about alive? Hm?</font>

421
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna know how I got these scars?</font>

422
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:16,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was...</font>

423
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">a drinker...</font>

424
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a fiend.</font>

425
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.</font>

426
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:28,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.</font>

427
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't like that...</font>

428
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">not one bit.</font>

429
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:36,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, me watching...</font>

430
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:40,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.</font>

431
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:44,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">He turns to me and he says:</font>

432
00:30:44,396 --> 00:30:48,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why so serious?"</font>

433
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">He comes at me with the knife.</font>

434
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:52,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Why so serious?"</font>

435
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sticks the blade in my mouth.</font>

436

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Let's put a smile on that face."</font>

437
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

438
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why so serious?</font>

439
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:15,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

440
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:18,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">our operation is small...</font>

441
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:21,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there is a lot of potential...</font>

442
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">for aggressive expansion.</font>

443
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:27,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?</font>

444
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:31,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...</font>

445
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">tryouts.</font>

446
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it fast.</font>

447
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.</font>

448
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.</font>

449
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

450
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:10,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.</font>

451
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

452
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.</font>

453
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:22,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...</font>

454
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.</font>

455
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:28,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">A businessman of your stature
will understand and...</font>

456
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:32,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">with you here now, we can continue.</font>

457
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:36,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...</font>

458
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do not allow cell phones in here.</font>

459
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.</font>

460
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:47,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.</font>

461
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:51,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...</font>

462
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:54,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever it is you're accused of being.</font>

463
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:57,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.</font>

464
00:32:57,277 --> 00:33:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.</font>

465
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:04,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.</font>

466
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just accidentally wasting it.</font>

467
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.</font>

468
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, sir.</font>

469
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a better view
from the peak tram.</font>

470
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's the view from LSI Holdings?</font>

471
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Restricted.</font>

472
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lau is holed up in there good and tight.</font>

473
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.</font>

476
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sonar. Just like a...</font>

477
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.</font>

478
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And the other device?
- It's in place.</font>

479
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:56,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Wayne?</font>

480
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

481
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.</font>

482
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.</font>

483
00:37:55,988 --> 00:38:00,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?</font>

484
00:38:00,284 --> 00:38:01,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you threatening my client?
- No.</font>

485
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:06,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.</font>

486
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">As will everyone.</font>

487
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:14,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? Okay.</font>

488
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:17,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.</font>

489
00:38:17,968 --> 00:38:19,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

490
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:21,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't give you the money...</font>

491
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:24,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I will give you my clients,
all of them.</font>

492
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:27,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a glorified accountant.</font>

493
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?</font>

494
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:35,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.</font>

495
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">One big pot.</font>

496
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:39,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

497
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">One minute.</font>

498
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they pooled their money...</font>

499
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.</font>

500
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:48,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charge them with what?</font>

501
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...</font>

502
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:54,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.</font>

503
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:57,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Lau.</font>

504
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:02,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?</font>

505
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:04,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...</font>

506
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:08,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.</font>

507
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...</font>

508
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's gonna happen
with all that money?</font>

509
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:16,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said, I'm good with calculation.</font>

510
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:21,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.</font>

511
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this, Gordon, your fortress?</font>

512
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:27,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you trust them over at County?</font>

513
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust them here.</font>

514
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lau stays.</font>

515
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...</font>

516
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm sure glad he's back.</font>

517
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put word out. We hire the clown.</font>

518
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:46,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was right.
We have to fix real problem.</font>

519
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:48,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman.</font>

520
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:56,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.</font>

521
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?</font>

522
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:03,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.</font>

523
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a nice trip. See you next fall.</font>

524
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.</font>

525
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.</font>

526
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.</font>

528
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.</font>

529
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do the defendants plead?</font>

530
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:36,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Order in the court.</font>

531
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.</font>

532
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?</font>

533
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:46,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.</font>

534
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...</font>

535
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.</font>

536
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.</font>

537
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:57,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the midlevel guys, they can't.</font>

538
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't afford to be off the streets.</font>

539
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.</font>

540
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:05,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.</font>

541
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:09,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.</font>

542
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

543
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.</font>

544
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that means it's on you.</font>

545
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.</font>

546
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Politicians, journalists, cops.</font>

547
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.</font>

548
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you up to it? You'd better be.</font>

549
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they get anything on you...</font>

550
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:45,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

552
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,189

will be a great success, sir.</font>

553
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:13,030

hold a party for Harvey Dent?</font>

554

557
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:24,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.</font>

The image is disturbing.</font>

560
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them your name.</font>

561
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brian Douglas.</font>

562
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And are you the real Batman?</font>

563
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:39,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No?</font>

564
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No?</font>

565
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why do you dress up like him?</font>

566
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</font>

567
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.</font>

568
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.</font>

569
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:58,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.</font>

570
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:02,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?</font>

571
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

572
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me!</font>

573
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,128

Batman's made Gotham.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You want order in Gotham...</font>

575
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:21,339

576
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.</font>

577
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,766

00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?</font>

583
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.</font>

584
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.</font>

585
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet, sir.</font>

586
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?</font>

587
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you have no idea.</font>

588
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry that I'm late.</font>

589
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.</font>

590
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:39,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, where is Harvey? Where...?</font>

591
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.</font>

592
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Rachel Dawes?</font>

593
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:46,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is my oldest friend. Come here.</font>

594
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...</font>

595
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had one thing to say:</font>

596
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"</font>

597
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.</font>

598
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it caught Rachel's attention.</font>

599
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:02,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...</font>

600
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.</font>

601
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what?</font>

602
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:11,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe in Harvey Dent.</font>

603
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:14,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...</font>

604
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:18,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little safer, a little more optimistic.</font>

605
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:24,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.</font>

606
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:26,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.</font>

607
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:28,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey.</font>

608
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:39,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey may not know you
well enough...</font>

609
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">to understand you're
making fun of him...</font>

610
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:44,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do.
- No, I meant every word.</font>

611
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that day
that you once told me about...</font>

612
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?</font>

613
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:52,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's coming.
- Bruce.</font>

614
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:59,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.</font>

615
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:03,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.</font>

616
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham needs a hero with a face.</font>

617
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.</font>

618
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks again.</font>

619
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:15,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind if I borrow Rachel?</font>

620
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:20,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?</font>

621
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:22,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forensics found three sets of DNA.</font>

622
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any matches?
- All three.</font>

623
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:28,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.</font>

624
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:30,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.</font>

625
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.</font>

626
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?</font>

627
00:46:35,665 --> 00:46:37,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">- City hall.
- Seal the building.</font>

628
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.</font>

629
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon. What are you up to?</font>

630
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.</font>

631
00:46:57,604 --> 00:47:00,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.</font>

632
00:47:00,356 --> 00:47:01,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are dangerous people.</font>

633
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:03,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not giving me
a lot of information.</font>

634
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even we don't know
where you're going.</font>

635
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:09,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.</font>

636
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't leave me alone
with these people.</font>

637
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:18,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?</font>

638
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:20,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.</font>

639
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:24,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...</font>

640
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:28,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.</font>

641
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:34,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.</font>

642
00:47:34,348 --> 00:47:36,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.</font>

643
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I bet.</font>

644
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:42,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...</font>

645
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">about who you wanna
spend your life with.</font>

646
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.</font>

647
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get to explain to my wife...</font>

648
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">why I'm late for dinner.</font>

649
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:01,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.</font>

650
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't do that.
- All right.</font>

651
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:09,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.</font>

652
00:48:09,674 --> 00:48:10,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your answer?</font>

653
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have an answer.</font>

654
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd they get my DNA?</font>

655
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody with access
to your office or house...</font>

656
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:26,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!</font>

657
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.</font>

658
00:48:29,986 --> 00:48:32,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.</font>

659
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...</font>

660
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

661
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:49,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

662
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:57,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a medic!</font>

663
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:02,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've come for him.</font>

664
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:04,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">We made it.</font>

665
00:49:07,355 --> 00:49:08,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay hidden.</font>

666
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</font>

667
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:20,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are tonight's entertainment.</font>

668
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:23,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only have one question:</font>

669
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:27,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Harvey Dent?</font>

670
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:39,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?</font>

671
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands up, pretty boy.</font>

672
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:50,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.</font>

673
00:49:50,856 --> 00:49:53,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just something little, huh? No.</font>

674
00:49:55,986 --> 00:49:58,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on out there? Wayne!</font>

675
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.</font>

676
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:02,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait...</font>

677
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you gotta be kidding me.</font>

678
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.</font>

679
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:11,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not intimidated by thugs.</font>

680
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

681
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:18,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">you remind me of my father.</font>

682
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:20,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated my father.</font>

683
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, stop.</font>

684
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:29,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hello, beautiful.</font>

685
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:35,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?</font>

686
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:38,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you are beautiful.</font>

687
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:49,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look nervous. Is it the scars?</font>

688
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:52,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna know how I got them?</font>

689
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:56,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here. Hey.</font>

690
00:50:56,671 --> 00:50:58,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

691
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...</font>

692
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:08,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">who tells me I worry too much...</font>

693
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">who tells me I ought to smile more...</font>

694
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:16,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.</font>

695
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day they carve her face.</font>

696
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:24,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.</font>

697
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?</font>

698
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.</font>

699
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

700
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:37,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...</font>

701
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:39,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">to myself.</font>

702
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:45,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.</font>

703
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:46,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">She leaves.</font>

704
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:49,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I see the funny side.</font>

705
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm always smiling.</font>

706
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:59,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a little fight in you. I like that.</font>

707
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're gonna love me.</font>

708
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:30,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the gun.</font>

709
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...</font>

710
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:35,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">and show us all who
you really are. Hm?</font>

711
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:42,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let her go.</font>

712
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very poor choice of words.</font>

713
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?</font>

714
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:13,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not do that again.</font>

715
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:16,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.</font>

716
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

717
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:20,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim, it's over.</font>

718
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.</font>

719
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:25,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prosecution's over.</font>

720
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:26,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...</font>

721
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:30,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.</font>

722
00:53:30,197 --> 00:53:31,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...</font>

723
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:33,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dent's halfway to Mex...</font>

724
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where do you keep your trash?</font>

725
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:40,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.</font>

726
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:43,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.</font>

727
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:47,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.</font>

728
00:53:47,172 --> 00:53:49,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?</font>

729
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Targeting me won't get their money.</font>

730
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...</font>

731
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:56,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is different.
They crossed a line.</font>

732
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:58,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You crossed the line first.</font>

733
00:53:58,392 --> 00:54:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.</font>

734
00:54:01,979 --> 00:54:06,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.</font>

735
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:10,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.</font>

736
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:12,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need to figure out
what he's after.</font>

737
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:13,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">With respect, Master Wayne...</font>

738
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:17,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.</font>

739
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">A long time ago, I was in Burma...</font>

740
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:24,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my friends and I were working
for the local government.</font>

741
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:26,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...</font>

742
00:54:27,128 --> 00:54:29,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">by bribing them with
precious stones...</font>

743
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:34,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.</font>

744
00:54:34,886 --> 00:54:38,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we went looking for the stones.</font>

745
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:43,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.</font>

746
00:54:44,312 --> 00:54:48,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...</font>

747
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:51,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">the size of a tangerine.</font>

748
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:55,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bandit had been
throwing them away.</font>

749
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:58,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.</font>

750
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:03,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.</font>

751
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:08,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.</font>

752
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:12,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.</font>

753
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:33,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name, sir?</font>

754
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:37,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.</font>

755
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:51,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check the names.</font>

756
00:55:58,218 --> 00:55:59,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Richard Dent."</font>

757

<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Dent.</font>

759
00:56:04,725 --> 00:56:07,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.</font>

760
00:56:07,936 --> 00:56:10,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's because of you
these guys are dead...</font>

761
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:11,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective!</font>

762
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:16,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us a minute, guys.</font>

763
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's brick underneath.</font>

764
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?</font>

765
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:22,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

766
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fingerprints.</font>

767
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:36,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.</font>

768
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:43,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.</font>

769
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.</font>

770
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:17,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?</font>

771
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:21,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.</font>

772
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I found some irregularities.</font>

773
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their CEO is in police custody.</font>

774
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:30,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not with their numbers, with yours.</font>

775
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:33,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...</font>

776
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">just disappeared overnight.</font>

777
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:39,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.</font>

778

recognize your baby...</font>

780
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:50,236

Department burning through cash...</font>

a rocket ship?</font>

783
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,621

785
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get this straight.</font>

786
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:13,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that your client...</font>

787
00:58:13,184 --> 00:58:16,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...</font>

788
00:58:16,438 --> 00:58:18,014

criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...</font>

790
00:58:23,027 --> 00:58:26,192

is to blackmail this person?</font>

791
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:34,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

792
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">When...</font>

793
00:58:40,669 --> 00:58:42,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep that.</font>

794
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your original scan.</font>

799
00:59:14,077 --> 00:59:16,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.</font>

800
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:18,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.</font>

801
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.</font>

802
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough.</font>

803
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">With no word
from the Batman...</font>

804

Commissioner Loeb...</font>

810
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,101

814
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:45,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.</font>

815
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:57,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...</font>

816
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to the protection
of his community.</font>

817
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:02,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember when I first took office...</font>

818
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.</font>

819
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:10,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.</font>

820
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:17,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.</font>

821
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:21,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's that?
- What happened?</font>

824
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:34,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took our guns.</font>

825
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:36,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">And our uniforms.</font>

826
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:45,556

the sacrifice of this man...</font>

827
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:49,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.</font>

843
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:40,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

844
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:41,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out there?</font>

845
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:47,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!</font>

846
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought this on us!</font>

847
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:55,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.</font>

848
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:59,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.</font>

849
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:03,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.</font>

850
01:04:04,112 --> 01:04:06,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?</font>

851
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:08,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

852
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:39,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
Second.</font>

853
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:40,385

in this town we can trust?</font>

862

863
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:09,420

<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...</font>

865

<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.</font>

867
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you go straight there.</font>

868
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:19,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.</font>

869

pick a better spot.</font>

the fall wouldn't kill me.</font>

- Huh!</font>

875
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:57,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.</font>

876
01:05:57,807 --> 01:05:59,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must have friends.</font>

877
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:01,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friends? Have you met this guy?</font>

878
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:03,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone knows where he is.</font>

879
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.</font>

880
01:06:06,316 --> 01:06:07,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're wise to your act.</font>

881
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:11,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.</font>

882
01:06:11,988 --> 01:06:16,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.</font>

883
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:18,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you already know what that is.</font>

884
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:21,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.</font>

885
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:27,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.</font>

886
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna play games?</font>

887
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:38,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that feel?</font>

888
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!</font>

889
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.</font>

890
01:06:44,604 --> 01:06:46,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.</font>

891
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:51,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, I wouldn't.</font>

892
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:54,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.</font>

893
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads, you get to keep your head.</font>

894
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tails...</font>

895
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:03,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">not so lucky.</font>

896
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:06,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you wanna tell me about the Joker?</font>

897
01:07:16,343 --> 01:07:20,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!</font>

898
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:22,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not playing the odds, friend.</font>

899
01:07:23,725 --> 01:07:25,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it again.</font>

900
01:07:28,564 --> 01:07:30,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd leave a man's life to chance?</font>

901
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:34,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.</font>

902
01:07:34,903 --> 01:07:37,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.</font>

903
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:42,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?</font>

904
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:48,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.</font>

905
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.</font>

906
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your stand against organized crime...</font>

907
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.</font>

908
01:07:57,342 --> 01:08:00,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.</font>

909
01:08:01,136 --> 01:08:03,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">The criminals you arrested
would be released...</font>

910
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.</font>

911
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:09,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.</font>

912
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.</font>

913
01:08:12,272 --> 01:08:14,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham's in your hands now.</font>

914
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:16,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't.</font>

915
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:18,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't give in.</font>

916
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't give in!</font>

917
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey called.</font>

918
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.</font>

919
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:41,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no choice.</font>

920
01:08:42,135 --> 01:08:45,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?</font>

921
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:48,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.</font>

922
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:54,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.</font>

923
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:58,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...</font>

924
01:08:58,318 --> 01:09:00,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we'd be together.</font>

925
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:04,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.</font>

926
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you mean it?</font>

927
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

928
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce.</font>

929
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.</font>

930
01:09:45,072 --> 01:09:48,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Logs as well?
Everything.</font>

931
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.</font>

932
01:09:56,917 --> 01:10:00,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?</font>

933
01:10:00,379 --> 01:10:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.</font>

934
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:07,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.</font>

935
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:13,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.</font>

936
01:10:13,892 --> 01:10:15,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">The right choice.</font>

937
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:18,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.</font>

938
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't endure this.</font>

939
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today you get to say "I told you so."</font>

940
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:27,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, I don't want to.</font>

941
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I did bloody tell you.</font>

942
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:40,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...</font>

943
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:42,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">as your accomplice.</font>

944
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:47,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.</font>

945
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.</font>

946
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:57,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...</font>

947
01:10:57,602 --> 01:11:01,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.</font>

948
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:05,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.</font>

949
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:07,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">But let's consider the situation.</font>

950
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:10,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?</font>

951
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:12,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we really think he's gonna...?</font>

952
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:15,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?</font>

953
01:11:15,953 --> 01:11:18,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Batman is an outlaw.</font>

954
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:21,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...</font>

955
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:22,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're doing it because we're scared.</font>

956
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.</font>

957
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:29,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are worse than ever!
Amen.</font>

958
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:32,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they are.</font>

959
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.</font>

960
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:42,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I promise you...</font>

961
01:11:43,146 --> 01:11:44,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">the dawn is coming.</font>

962
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:49,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...</font>

963
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:51,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">not to this madman.</font>

964
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:53,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No more dead cops!
Yeah!</font>

965
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should turn himself in!</font>

966
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:01,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?</font>

967
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:06,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">So be it. Take the Batman into custody.</font>

968
01:12:06,962 --> 01:12:08,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Is he here?</font>

969
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:10,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the Batman.</font>

970
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Come on.</font>

971
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:24,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred.</font>

972
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:27,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is he letting Harvey do this?</font>

973
01:12:27,607 --> 01:12:30,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.</font>

974
01:12:30,777 --> 01:12:32,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...</font>

975
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:36,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">believe that Batman stands for
something more important...</font>

976
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:38,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...</font>

977
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if everyone hates him for it.</font>

978
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the sacrifice he's making.</font>

979
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:46,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.</font>

980
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:48,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're absolutely right.</font>

981
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:52,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.</font>

982
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:56,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know him better than anyone.</font>

983
01:12:56,927 --> 01:12:57,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

984
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:04,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?</font>

985
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will I know?</font>

986
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:08,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not sealed.</font>

987
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:11,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Alfred.</font>

988
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:17,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, Rachel.</font>

989
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:27,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't have time to talk this through.</font>

990
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:28,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

991
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're transferring me
to Central Holding.</font>

992
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:34,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.</font>

993
01:13:35,132 --> 01:13:36,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. This is too dangerous.</font>

994
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:40,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...</font>

995
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:44,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.</font>

996
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you got some moves, pal.</font>

997
01:13:46,226 --> 01:13:49,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.</font>

998
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:50,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's failed so far.</font>

999
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know
what he's thinking?</font>

1000
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.</font>

1001
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the people
depending on you...</font>

1002
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?</font>

1003
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.</font>

1004
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads, I go through with it.</font>

1005
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your life. You can't leave...</font>

1006
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:15,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">something like that to chance.
- I'm not.</font>

1007
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:21,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make your own luck.</font>

1008
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:45,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.</font>

1009
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

1010
01:14:55,878 --> 01:14:58,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!</font>

1011
01:14:58,255 --> 01:15:01,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.</font>

1012
01:15:01,884 --> 01:15:02,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exit down!</font>

1013
01:15:03,177 --> 01:15:05,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.</font>

1014
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:40,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.</font>

1015
01:15:42,716 --> 01:15:45,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.</font>

1016
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got trouble, guys.</font>

1017
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:50,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock and load!</font>

1018
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:03,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hell was that?</font>

1019
01:16:25,258 --> 01:16:27,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...</font>

1020
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:29,884

1022
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:35,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that, a bazooka?</font>

1023
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:45,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't sign up for this!</font>

1024
01:17:01,752 --> 01:17:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out.</font>

1025
01:17:03,879 --> 01:17:05,040

1026
01:17:13,347 --> 01:17:14,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1027
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:28,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go!</font>

1028
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.</font>

1029
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.</font>

Scanning all systems.</font>

1031
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!</font>

1032
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like this job. I like it.</font>

1033

some of their own medicine.</font>

1036
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:27,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.</font>

1037
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, rack them up.</font>

1038
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:45,163

rack them up.</font>

1039
01:20:10,902 --> 01:20:12,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not good.</font>

1040
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:16,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's not good!</font>

1041
01:20:59,908 --> 01:21:01,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, there's a Batman.</font>

1042
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.</font>

1043
01:21:10,419 --> 01:21:11,533

1053
01:22:44,261 --> 01:22:46,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please just give me a minute?</font>

1054

pretty close to the chest.</font>

1056

<font color="#FFFFFF">We got him, Harvey.</font>

1057
01:22:59,985 --> 01:23:03,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?</font>

1058
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:06,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.</font>

with the Batman all along.</font>

to do the right thing.</font>

1062

- Saving my ass.</font>

1063
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:17,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.</font>

1064

Mr. Dent, sir...</font>

Mr. Dent.</font>

1068

<font color="#FFFFFF">couldn't risk my family's safety.</font>

1073

<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we got?</font>

1074
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:04,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.</font>

1075

1076
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing in his pockets

<font color="#FFFFFF">No name.</font>

1078

Go home, Gordon.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.</font>

1081
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:21,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow you take the big job.</font>

1082
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:25,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.</font>

1083

1084
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,628

1085
01:24:51,803 --> 01:24:53,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.</font>

1086
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:56,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.</font>

1087

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please!
- Step away from the bars!</font>

1088

<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, this time...</font>

1091
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:23,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saved him.</font>

1092
01:25:34,387 --> 01:25:36,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he said anything yet?</font>

1093
01:25:43,604 --> 01:25:47,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evening, commissioner.</font>

1094
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Dent never made it home.</font>

1095
01:25:57,827 --> 01:25:59,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?</font>

1096
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:02,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?</font>

1097
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was right here.</font>

1098
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did you leave him with?</font>

1099
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm? Your people?</font>

1100
01:26:13,759 --> 01:26:17,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...</font>

1101
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:19,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not Maroni's.</font>

1102
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:24,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it depress you, commissioner...</font>

1103
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:29,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">to know just how alone you really are?</font>

1104
01:26:31,944 --> 01:26:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?</font>

1105
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:39,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is he?
- What's the time?</font>

1106
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">What difference does that make?</font>

1107
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:47,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.</font>

1108
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:56,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?</font>

1109
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:01,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.</font>

1110
01:27:02,015 --> 01:27:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?</font>

1111
01:27:06,769 --> 01:27:07,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.</font>

1112
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:22,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...</font>

1113
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:26,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

1114
01:27:26,831 --> 01:27:29,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted me. Here I am.</font>

1115
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to see what you'd do.</font>

1116
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:35,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you didn't disappoint.</font>

1117
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:38,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let five people die.</font>

1118
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:43,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you let Dent take your place.</font>

1119
01:27:43,264 --> 01:27:45,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?</font>

1120
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:50,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.</font>

1121
01:27:51,355 --> 01:27:56,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.</font>

1122
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:58,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?</font>

1123
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:03,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna kill you.</font>

1124
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:08,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.</font>

1125
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:10,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, you...</font>

1126
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:13,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You complete me.</font>

1127
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:17,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.</font>

1128
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you'd like to be.</font>

1129
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:23,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">To them, you're just a freak...</font>

1130
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">like me.</font>

1131
01:28:25,847 --> 01:28:28,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need you right now...</font>

1132
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when they don't...</font>

1133
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:34,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll cast you out like a leper.</font>

1134
01:28:34,523 --> 01:28:38,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, their morals, their code...</font>

1135
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:40,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's a bad joke.</font>

1136
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:44,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dropped at the first sign of trouble.</font>

1137
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:49,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.</font>

1139
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">These civilized people...</font>

1140
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:57,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll eat each other.</font>

1141
01:28:57,837 --> 01:29:00,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I'm not a monster.</font>

1142
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just ahead of the curve.</font>

1143
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:06,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Dent?</font>

1144
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:09,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.</font>

1145
01:29:12,393 --> 01:29:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's in control.
- I have one rule.</font>

1146
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:18,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.</font>

1147
01:29:18,232 --> 01:29:19,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is?</font>

1148
01:29:19,567 --> 01:29:21,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only sensible way to live
is without rules.</font>

1149
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.</font>

1150
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:26,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm considering it.</font>

1151

01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:37,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.</font>

1155

<font color="#FFFFFF">The way you threw yourself after her.</font>

1156

<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you go.</font>

1157
01:29:53,142 --> 01:29:56,724

about you and his little bunny?</font>

1158

1176
01:31:10,259 --> 01:31:11,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all right. I'm in a...</font>

1177

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I am too.</font>

1179

<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey.</font>

1180
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:29,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want my phone call.</font>

1181
01:31:29,987 --> 01:31:32,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.</font>

1182
01:31:33,449 --> 01:31:35,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nice.</font>

1183
01:31:36,785 --> 01:31:41,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many of your friends have I killed?</font>

1184
01:31:45,377 --> 01:31:46,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a 20-year man...</font>

1185
01:31:46,628 --> 01:31:50,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...</font>

1186
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:53,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.</font>

1187
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:56,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you killed six of my friends.</font>

1188
01:31:56,638 --> 01:31:57,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six?</font>

1189
01:31:57,848 --> 01:32:00,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. My insides hurt.</font>

1190
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:02,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really care. Back away.</font>

1191
01:32:02,394 --> 01:32:05,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.</font>

1192
01:32:05,731 --> 01:32:09,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he'd go inside

1198
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:24,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...</font>

1199
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:27,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.</font>

1200
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Rachel.</font>

1201
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:36,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.</font>

01:32:36,386 --> 01:32:40,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.</font>

1203
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:42,757

anything, sharp?</font>

1204
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:44,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying.</font>

1205
01:32:44,519 --> 01:32:46,677

01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, what's happening?</font>

1208
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">All available units,

<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, in their last moments...</font>

1214
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:31,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">people show you who they really are.</font>

1215
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:38,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.</font>

1216
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:45,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?</font>

1217
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?
Jeez.</font>

1218

1220
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:04,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.</font>

1221
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa!</font>

1222
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just put it down.</font>

1223
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!</font>

1224
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!</font>

1225
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:23,155

- What do you want?</font>

1226
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want my phone call.</font>

1227
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...? What...? What's happening?</font>

1228
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just talk to me, just for one second.</font>

1229
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,799

- Right.</font>

1230

01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a phone?</font>

1233
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:04,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mount the curb!</font>

1234
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?</font>

1235
01:35:16,835 --> 01:35:18,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think like that. They're coming.</font>

1236
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:21,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know they are,
but I don't want them to.</font>

and I do have an answer for you.</font>

1238
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">My answer is yes.</font>

1239
01:35:34,519 --> 01:35:37,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No!</font>

1240
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:40,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me! Why are you coming for me?</font>

1241
01:35:40,233 --> 01:35:41,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1242

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello there.</font>

1252
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:32,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.</font>

1253
01:36:32,994 --> 01:36:34,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Lau?</font>

1254
01:36:37,498 --> 01:36:40,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Joker planned to be caught.</font>

1255
01:36:40,418 --> 01:36:42,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.</font>

1256
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:04,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear Bruce:</font>

1257
01:37:06,026 --> 01:37:08,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be honest and clear.</font>

1258
01:37:10,614 --> 01:37:13,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.</font>

1259
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:17,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.</font>

1260
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:22,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...</font>

1261
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:24,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant it.</font>

1262
01:37:24,836 --> 01:37:29,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.</font>

1263
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:32,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it does.</font>

1264
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if it does, I will be there...</font>

1265
01:37:36,014 --> 01:37:37,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">but as your friend.</font>

1266
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:40,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Harvey.</font>

1267
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to let you down.</font>

1268
01:37:43,104 --> 01:37:48,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.</font>

1269
01:37:48,693 --> 01:37:53,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love, now and always, Rachel.</font>

1270
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepared a little breakfast.</font>

1271
01:38:07,545 --> 01:38:09,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very well, then.

1272
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:10,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Master Wayne?</font>

1273
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:14,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I bring this on her?</font>

1274
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:17,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was meant to inspire good...</font>

1275
01:38:17,847 --> 01:38:20,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">not madness, not death.</font>

1276
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:25,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.</font>

1277
01:38:25,187 --> 01:38:27,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you think
there might be casualties?</font>

1278
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things always get worse
before they get better.</font>

1279
01:38:30,192 --> 01:38:31,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Rachel, Alfred.</font>

1280
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:35,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel believed in what you stood for...</font>

1281
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:37,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we stand for.</font>

1282
01:38:37,867 --> 01:38:39,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham needs you.</font>

1283
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:42,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Gotham needs its true hero...</font>

1284
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:47,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.</font>

1285
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why, for now...</font>

1286
01:38:50,754 --> 01:38:52,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're gonna have to
make do with you.</font>

1287
01:38:54,883 --> 01:38:56,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.</font>

1288
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:00,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dent doesn't know.</font>

1289
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:02,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can never know.</font>

1290
01:39:04,643 --> 01:39:06,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

1291
01:39:06,436 --> 01:39:09,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It can wait.
- That bandit...</font>

1292

<font color="#FFFFFF">in the forest in Burma.</font>

1293
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:14,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you catch him?
- Yes.</font>

1294
01:39:14,361 --> 01:39:15,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

1295
01:39:17,114 --> 01:39:18,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">We burned the forest down.</font>

1296
01:39:57,987 --> 01:40:00,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.</font>

1297
01:40:00,782 --> 01:40:04,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.</font>

1298
01:40:04,327 --> 01:40:06,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.</font>

1299
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:09,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.</font>

1300
01:40:25,973 --> 01:40:27,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about Rachel.</font>

1301
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:35,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.</font>

1302
01:40:36,191 --> 01:40:38,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you're refusing to...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.</font>

1312
01:41:12,018 --> 01:41:16,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I hide who I am?</font>

1313
01:41:17,524 --> 01:41:18,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you tried to warn me.</font>

1314
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:20,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1315
01:41:21,569 --> 01:41:24,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?</font>

1316
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:28,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who picked up Rachel?</font>

1317
01:41:29,703 --> 01:41:32,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.</font>

1318
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:35,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you listen to me now?</font>

1319
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:37,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Harvey.</font>

1320
01:41:40,547 --> 01:41:42,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1321
01:41:42,799 --> 01:41:44,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not.</font>

1322
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:47,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

1323
01:41:52,475 --> 01:41:55,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">This craziness, it's too much.</font>

1324
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:58,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.</font>

1325
01:41:58,815 --> 01:42:00,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want him?</font>

1326
01:42:03,027 --> 01:42:05,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.</font>

1327
01:42:13,412 --> 01:42:15,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so crazy as you look.</font>

1328
01:42:15,873 --> 01:42:19,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, I'm a man of my word.</font>

1329
01:42:22,838 --> 01:42:24,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the Italian?</font>

1330
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.</font>

1331
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:31,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.</font>

1332
01:42:31,597 --> 01:42:32,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1333
01:42:32,931 --> 01:42:36,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?</font>

1334
01:42:36,935 --> 01:42:39,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.</font>

1335
01:42:39,771 --> 01:42:41,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I enjoy...</font>

1336
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:42,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">dynamite...</font>

1337
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gunpowder...</font>

1338
01:42:45,152 --> 01:42:47,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and gasoline.</font>

1339
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:51,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.</font>

1340
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:55,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know the thing
that they have in common?</font>

1341
01:42:56,455 --> 01:42:57,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're cheap.</font>

1342
01:42:57,914 --> 01:43:00,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?</font>

1343
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.</font>

1344
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.</font>

1345
01:43:06,464 --> 01:43:07,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take the next caller.</font>

1346
01:43:07,966 --> 01:43:10,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.</font>

1347
01:43:10,302 --> 01:43:11,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you know better?</font>

1348
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:15,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.</font>

1349
01:43:15,306 --> 01:43:19,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.</font>

1350
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:21,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you were a man of your word.</font>

1351
01:43:22,063 --> 01:43:24,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I am.</font>

1352
01:43:25,817 --> 01:43:28,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only burning my half.</font>

1353
01:43:29,821 --> 01:43:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you care about is money.</font>

1354
01:43:32,115 --> 01:43:35,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">This town deserves
a better class of criminal...</font>

1355
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:37,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm gonna give it to them.</font>

1356
01:43:38,788 --> 01:43:41,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your men they work for me now.</font>

1357
01:43:41,457 --> 01:43:43,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my city.</font>

1358
01:43:44,502 --> 01:43:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't work for a freak.</font>

1359
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:48,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Freak."</font>

1360
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:51,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...</font>

1361
01:43:51,717 --> 01:43:53,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">and feed you to your pooches? Hm?</font>

1362
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.</font>

1363
01:43:58,224 --> 01:44:00,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not about money...</font>

1364
01:44:00,726 --> 01:44:03,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's about sending a message.</font>

1365
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:07,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything burns.</font>

1366
01:44:09,693 --> 01:44:11,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is this?
I had a vision...</font>

1367
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:14,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a world without Batman.</font>

1368
01:44:14,949 --> 01:44:17,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mob ground out a little profit...</font>

1369
01:44:17,368 --> 01:44:21,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.</font>

1370
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it was so boring.</font>

1371
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:26,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had a change of heart.</font>

1372
01:44:27,044 --> 01:44:29,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...</font>

1373
01:44:29,838 --> 01:44:34,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.</font>

1374
01:44:34,718 --> 01:44:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...</font>

1375
01:44:39,723 --> 01:44:41,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I blow up a hospital.</font>

1376
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:43,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call in every officer.</font>

1377
01:44:43,727 --> 01:44:47,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.</font>

1378
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:49,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.</font>

1379
01:44:49,524 --> 01:44:51,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get every bus down to a hospital.</font>

1380
01:44:51,318 --> 01:44:55,896

everybody out of that place right now.</font>

1381
01:44:56,072 --> 01:44:57,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, you and you, you come with me.</font>

1382
01:44:57,908 --> 01:44:59,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.</font>

1383
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:03,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.</font>

1384
01:45:03,371 --> 01:45:05,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.</font>

1385
01:45:05,749 --> 01:45:07,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you be wanting the Batpod?</font>

1386
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.</font>

1387
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:10,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lamborghini, then.</font>

1388
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:13,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much more subtle.</font>

1389
01:45:26,894 --> 01:45:29,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.</font>

1390
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:33,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, could you help, please?</font>

1391
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:34,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna find a bus for him.</font>

1392
01:45:36,904 --> 01:45:38,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...</font>

1393
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:41,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?</font>

1394
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir. Commissioner.</font>

1395
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:52,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the cars around the back!</font>

1396
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:55,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Keep rolling, Sam.</font>

1397
01:46:01,929 --> 01:46:03,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see O'Brien and Richards.</font>

1398
01:46:04,473 --> 01:46:07,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.</font>

- Well, maybe Batman can save you.</font>

1400
01:46:25,953 --> 01:46:28,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Davis, they got space. Bring him out.</font>

1401

<font color="#FFFFFF">Davis.</font>

1402
01:46:37,172 --> 01:46:39,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Burns and Zachary.</font>

1403
01:46:39,674 --> 01:46:40,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing on them.</font>

1404
01:46:41,051 --> 01:46:42,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a patrolman I don't know.</font>

1405
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, what now?</font>

1406
01:46:46,514 --> 01:46:48,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do now?
Where are we going?</font>

1407
01:46:51,519 --> 01:46:53,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send the information to Gordon.</font>

1408
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:02,612

1410
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:12,028

move him now.</font>

1411

- Commissioner.</font>

1412

01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

1415
01:47:55,416 --> 01:47:58,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Your men, your plan.</font>

1421
01:48:12,558 --> 01:48:15,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I really look like a guy with a plan?</font>

1422
01:48:15,435 --> 01:48:18,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.</font>

1423
01:48:18,855 --> 01:48:21,310

<font color="#FFFFFF">You know? I just do things.</font>

1425

<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.</font>

1426

<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon's got plans.</font>

1427
01:48:31,243 --> 01:48:34,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, they're schemers.</font>

1428
01:48:34,371 --> 01:48:38,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.</font>

1429

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a schemer.</font>

1430
01:48:39,959 --> 01:48:41,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to show the schemers...</font>

1431
01:48:41,753 --> 01:48:47,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.</font>

1432
01:48:48,009 --> 01:48:51,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when I say... Ah. Come here.</font>

1433
01:48:51,554 --> 01:48:55,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll know that I'm telling the truth.</font>

- What?</font>

1436
01:49:07,904 --> 01:49:09,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?</font>

1437
01:49:10,448 --> 01:49:11,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that'd be why.</font>

1438
01:49:12,909 --> 01:49:16,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the schemers
that put you where you are.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a schemer, you had plans...</font>

1440
01:49:20,249 --> 01:49:22,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">and look where that got you.</font>

1441
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:35,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police are taking every precaution...</font>

1442

<font color="#FFFFFF">I just did what I do best.</font>

1444
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.</font>

1445
01:49:44,523 --> 01:49:49,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.</font>

1446
01:49:50,028 --> 01:49:53,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm? You know what I noticed?</font>

1447
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:57,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."</font>

1448

a gangbanger will get shot...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">nobody panics.</font>

1452
01:50:10,257 --> 01:50:13,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's all part of the plan.</font>

1453
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:18,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...</font>

1454
01:50:18,682 --> 01:50:21,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, then, everyone loses their minds.</font>

1455
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:27,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Introduce a little anarchy...</font>

1456
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">upset the established order...</font>

1457
01:50:31,027 --> 01:50:35,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everything becomes chaos.</font>

02:02:03,209 --> 02:02:05,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's it gonna be?</font>

1605
02:02:05,503 --> 02:02:08,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...</font>

1606
02:02:08,214 --> 02:02:11,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the sweet and innocent civilians?</font>

1607
02:02:11,717 --> 02:02:14,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">You choose.</font>

1608
02:02:14,428 --> 02:02:16,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...</font>

1609
02:02:16,514 --> 02:02:20,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.</font>

1610
02:02:28,233 --> 02:02:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back.</font>

1611
02:02:29,443 --> 02:02:33,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.</font>

1612
02:02:33,614 --> 02:02:37,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.</font>

1613
02:02:37,826 --> 02:02:41,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?</font>

1614
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:44,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.</font>

1615
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:46,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!</font>

1616
02:02:52,132 --> 02:02:54,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.</font>

1617
02:02:54,885 --> 02:02:57,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.</font>

1618
02:02:58,096 --> 02:02:59,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the units outside...</font>

1619
02:02:59,973 --> 02:03:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those cops can't be trusted.</font>

1620
02:03:01,725 --> 02:03:04,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.</font>

1621
02:03:04,853 --> 02:03:07,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.</font>

1622
02:03:07,981 --> 02:03:11,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Street.</font>

1623
02:03:11,985 --> 02:03:13,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.</font>

1624
02:03:14,028 --> 02:03:15,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1625
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:17,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">She believe you?</font>

1626
02:03:17,782 --> 02:03:19,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's because she trusts you...</font>

1627
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:21,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">just like Rachel did.</font>

1628
02:03:21,411 --> 02:03:23,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?</font>

1629
02:03:23,663 --> 02:03:26,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the second cop to say that to me.</font>

1630
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:28,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?</font>

1631
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...</font>

1632
02:03:31,379 --> 02:03:34,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't!
- I'm sorry.</font>

1633
02:03:34,966 --> 02:03:37,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">You live to fight another day, officer.</font>

1634
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:43,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found the missing hospital bus.</font>

1635
02:03:43,224 --> 02:03:44,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we have a hostage situation.</font>

1636
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:49,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shooting gallery.</font>

1637
02:03:49,397 --> 02:03:51,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?</font>

1638
02:03:51,857 --> 02:03:53,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have clear shots on five clowns.</font>

1639
02:03:53,859 --> 02:03:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.</font>

1640
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Team moves in by the stairwells.</font>

1641
02:03:58,697 --> 02:04:00,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three casualties max.</font>

1642
02:04:00,991 --> 02:04:02,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do it.
It's not that simple.</font>

1643
02:04:03,035 --> 02:04:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...</font>

1644
02:04:05,538 --> 02:04:08,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...</font>

1645
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:11,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!</font>

1646
02:04:11,585 --> 02:04:15,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...</font>

1647
02:04:15,506 --> 02:04:17,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">on this piece of paper.</font>

1648
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:21,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone's got pens, pass it along.</font>

1649
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:23,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Anybody else?</font>

1650
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.</font>

1651
02:04:25,682 --> 02:04:28,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get these votes in quickly.</font>

1652
02:04:28,727 --> 02:04:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1653
02:04:32,272 --> 02:04:34,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?
Push the button!</font>

1654
02:04:34,566 --> 02:04:36,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're running out of time!</font>

1655
02:04:37,819 --> 02:04:39,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need five minutes alone.</font>

1656
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:41,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! There's no time!</font>

1657
02:04:41,823 --> 02:04:43,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have clear shots!</font>

1658
02:04:43,408 --> 02:04:46,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!</font>

1659
02:04:46,495 --> 02:04:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to save Dent.</font>

1660
02:04:48,622 --> 02:04:49,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready.</font>

1661
02:04:52,584 --> 02:04:55,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two minutes, then we breach.</font>

1662
02:05:00,842 --> 02:05:02,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fox, I need picture.</font>

1663
02:05:05,388 --> 02:05:07,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.</font>

1664
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:11,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you got POV on alpha...</font>

1665
02:05:12,437 --> 02:05:14,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">omni on beta.</font>

1666
02:05:15,857 --> 02:05:19,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.</font>

1667
02:05:19,402 --> 02:05:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.</font>

1668
02:05:25,116 --> 02:05:27,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another SWA T team on the roof.</font>

1669
02:05:29,287 --> 02:05:30,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Line's clear.</font>

1670
02:05:32,248 --> 02:05:34,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!</font>

1671
02:05:35,126 --> 02:05:38,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?</font>

1672
02:05:39,171 --> 02:05:42,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.</font>

1673
02:05:45,469 --> 02:05:47,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blue team, acquire the target.</font>

1674
02:05:48,806 --> 02:05:51,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entry team, set your charge.</font>

1675
02:06:07,324 --> 02:06:09,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.</font>

1676
02:06:09,326 --> 02:06:10,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">The clowns are the hostages.</font>

1677
02:06:11,537 --> 02:06:13,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red team, go! Red team, go!</font>

1678
02:06:17,084 --> 02:06:18,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entry team, blow and go!</font>

1679
02:06:22,589 --> 02:06:23,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move.</font>

1680
02:06:25,175 --> 02:06:26,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the shot.</font>

1681
02:06:32,182 --> 02:06:33,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.</font>

1682
02:06:34,017 --> 02:06:35,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clowns, put down your guns.</font>

1683
02:06:36,353 --> 02:06:38,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!</font>

1684
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:42,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...</font>

1685
02:07:06,966 --> 02:07:08,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze!</font>

1686
02:07:08,301 --> 02:07:10,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand down or you will be...</font>

1687
02:07:14,223 --> 02:07:15,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look up.</font>

1688
02:07:16,267 --> 02:07:18,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">See those bad guys on the floor above?</font>

1689
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.</font>

1690
02:07:22,481 --> 02:07:23,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sixty seconds.</font>

1691
02:07:31,824 --> 02:07:36,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tally is 140 against, 396 for.</font>

1692
02:07:44,545 --> 02:07:47,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">So go ahead. Do it.</font>

1693
02:07:47,256 --> 02:07:49,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're still here.</font>

1694
02:07:50,426 --> 02:07:53,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.</font>

1695
02:07:54,847 --> 02:07:56,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

1696
02:07:56,765 --> 02:07:58,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blue team, cover!</font>

1697
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

1698
02:08:04,064 --> 02:08:05,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trouble on the floor above.</font>

1699
02:08:15,075 --> 02:08:16,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down on the ground now!</font>

1700
02:08:24,876 --> 02:08:27,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.</font>

1701
02:08:27,462 --> 02:08:29,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will shoot you. Drop the officer.</font>

1702
02:08:29,631 --> 02:08:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Release the officer right now.</font>

1703
02:08:31,341 --> 02:08:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him go now!
On your knees!</font>

1704
02:08:33,885 --> 02:08:35,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got him. He's out of the game.</font>

1705
02:08:36,137 --> 02:08:38,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!</font>

1706
02:08:46,689 --> 02:08:48,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt!</font>

1707
02:09:01,621 --> 02:09:02,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down!
Don't move!</font>

1708
02:09:03,164 --> 02:09:07,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.</font>

1709
02:09:13,758 --> 02:09:15,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.</font>

1710
02:09:16,093 --> 02:09:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.</font>

1711
02:09:32,651 --> 02:09:35,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put down your weapon!
Don't move!</font>

1712
02:10:07,144 --> 02:10:09,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't wanna die...</font>

1713
02:10:09,187 --> 02:10:12,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't know how to take a life.</font>

1714
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:14,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

1715
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:18,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men will kill you
and take it anyway.</font>

1716
02:10:22,117 --> 02:10:24,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one wants to get their hands dirty.</font>

1717
02:10:24,786 --> 02:10:27,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. I'll do it.</font>

1718
02:10:29,416 --> 02:10:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.</font>

1719
02:10:32,293 --> 02:10:34,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">They chose to murder and steal.</font>

1720
02:10:34,754 --> 02:10:37,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.</font>

1721
02:10:47,433 --> 02:10:49,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the old familiar places.</font>

1722
02:10:56,192 --> 02:10:57,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand by.</font>

1723
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:11,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.</font>

1724
02:11:11,415 --> 02:11:13,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

1725
02:11:14,919 --> 02:11:18,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can tell them I took it by force.</font>

1726
02:11:19,173 --> 02:11:24,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.</font>

1727
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:49,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.</font>

1728
02:11:49,661 --> 02:11:51,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't be any fireworks.</font>

1729
02:11:51,913 --> 02:11:55,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here we go.</font>

1730
02:12:34,455 --> 02:12:36,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you trying to prove?</font>

1731
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:39,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?</font>

1732
02:12:40,628 --> 02:12:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're alone.</font>

1733
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:53,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?</font>

1734
02:12:53,975 --> 02:12:56,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay. I came prepared.</font>

1735
02:12:57,019 --> 02:13:01,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?</font>

1736
02:13:01,649 --> 02:13:04,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but I know how you got these.</font>

1737
02:13:22,294 --> 02:13:25,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you.</font>

1738
02:13:25,214 --> 02:13:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just couldn't let me go, could you?</font>

1739
02:13:29,384 --> 02:13:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...</font>

1740
02:13:33,472 --> 02:13:37,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">meets an immovable object.</font>

1741
02:13:38,518 --> 02:13:43,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?</font>

1742
02:13:44,107 --> 02:13:46,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? You won't kill me...</font>

1743
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:53,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.</font>

1744
02:13:53,408 --> 02:13:56,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I won't kill you...</font>

1745
02:13:56,786 --> 02:14:00,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you're just too much fun.</font>

1746
02:14:01,624 --> 02:14:05,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.</font>

1747
02:14:05,962 --> 02:14:07,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be in a padded cell forever.</font>

1748
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:09,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we could share one.</font>

1749
02:14:10,133 --> 02:14:11,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
they'll be doubling up...</font>

1750
02:14:11,759 --> 02:14:14,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.</font>

1751
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:17,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">This city just showed you...</font>

1752
02:14:17,765 --> 02:14:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.</font>

1753
02:14:21,978 --> 02:14:25,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until their spirit breaks completely.</font>

1754
02:14:26,024 --> 02:14:30,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...</font>

1755
02:14:31,028 --> 02:14:33,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all the heroic things he's done.</font>

1756
02:14:35,491 --> 02:14:40,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...</font>

1757
02:14:40,705 --> 02:14:43,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a fistfight with you?</font>

1758
02:14:44,166 --> 02:14:45,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1759
02:14:45,876 --> 02:14:49,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need an ace in the hole.</font>

1760
02:14:49,463 --> 02:14:51,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine's Harvey.</font>

1761
02:14:51,465 --> 02:14:53,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do?</font>

1762
02:14:53,342 --> 02:14:56,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took Gotham's white knight...</font>

1763
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I brought him down to our level.</font>

1764
02:15:00,558 --> 02:15:03,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...</font>

1765
02:15:03,686 --> 02:15:06,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">is like gravity.</font>

1766
02:15:06,897 --> 02:15:09,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">All it takes is a little push.</font>

1767
02:15:26,166 --> 02:15:27,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dent!</font>

1768
02:15:48,897 --> 02:15:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.</font>

1769
02:15:53,985 --> 02:15:55,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where she died.</font>

1770
02:15:55,737 --> 02:15:58,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I was here...</font>

1771
02:15:59,115 --> 02:16:01,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to save her.
- But you didn't.</font>

1772
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.</font>

1773
02:16:04,078 --> 02:16:05,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'd listened to me.</font>

1774
02:16:05,747 --> 02:16:08,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you stood up against corruption...</font>

1775
02:16:08,541 --> 02:16:10,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">instead of doing your deal
with the devil.</font>

1776
02:16:10,918 --> 02:16:12,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to fight the Mob!</font>

1777
02:16:13,046 --> 02:16:17,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.</font>

1778
02:16:19,177 --> 02:16:22,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...</font>

1779
02:16:22,472 --> 02:16:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?</font>

1780
02:16:28,019 --> 02:16:31,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.</font>

1781
02:16:32,648 --> 02:16:36,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.</font>

1782
02:16:38,279 --> 02:16:41,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.</font>

1783
02:16:42,032 --> 02:16:44,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the person you love most.</font>

1784
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:55,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">So is it your wife?</font>

1785
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the gun down, Harvey.</font>

1786
02:16:58,924 --> 02:17:00,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, put down the gun.</font>

1787
02:17:00,759 --> 02:17:04,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please, Harvey. Please.</font>

1788
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:06,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, goddamn it.</font>

1789
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:09,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?</font>

1790
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:11,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!
- We have a winner.</font>

1791
02:17:11,645 --> 02:17:13,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Jim, stop him!</font>

1792
02:17:13,647 --> 02:17:15,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey.
Don't let him...</font>

1793
02:17:15,649 --> 02:17:16,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey!</font>

1794
02:17:18,151 --> 02:17:20,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry!</font>

1795
02:17:21,822 --> 02:17:22,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">For everything.</font>

1796
02:17:25,492 --> 02:17:27,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't hurt my son.</font>

1797
02:17:37,837 --> 02:17:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought your cops?</font>

1798
02:17:39,589 --> 02:17:42,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">All they know is there's a situation.</font>

1799
02:17:42,634 --> 02:17:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.</font>

1800
02:17:45,804 --> 02:17:48,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I wanna escape from this?</font>

1801
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no escape from this.</font>

1802
02:17:51,559 --> 02:17:53,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.</font>

1803
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:59,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!</font>

1804
02:17:59,942 --> 02:18:04,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.</font>

1805
02:18:06,949 --> 02:18:08,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you were wrong.</font>

1806
02:18:08,743 --> 02:18:12,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...</font>

1807
02:18:13,289 --> 02:18:15,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">is chance.</font>

1808
02:18:15,374 --> 02:18:17,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unbiased.</font>

1809
02:18:17,293 --> 02:18:18,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unprejudiced.</font>

1810
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:21,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair.</font>

1811
02:18:21,213 --> 02:18:23,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">His son's got the same chance she had.</font>

1812
02:18:24,216 --> 02:18:25,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty-fifty.</font>

1813
02:18:25,676 --> 02:18:29,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.</font>

1814
02:18:29,472 --> 02:18:30,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We three.</font>

1815
02:18:30,973 --> 02:18:34,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?</font>

1816
02:18:36,896 --> 02:18:39,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.</font>

1817
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:41,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you were the best of us.</font>

1818
02:18:42,151 --> 02:18:47,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...</font>

1819
02:18:47,322 --> 02:18:49,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">could fall.</font>

1820
02:18:49,408 --> 02:18:50,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was right.</font>

1821
02:18:50,868 --> 02:18:53,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.</font>

1822
02:18:53,287 --> 02:18:56,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">So point it at the people responsible.</font>

1823
02:18:57,291 --> 02:18:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fair enough.</font>

1824
02:19:02,462 --> 02:19:04,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You first.</font>

1825
02:19:16,852 --> 02:19:18,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">My turn.</font>

1826
02:19:25,443 --> 02:19:27,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey, you're right.</font>

1827
02:19:28,488 --> 02:19:31,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rachel's death was my fault.</font>

1828
02:19:34,202 --> 02:19:36,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't punish the boy.</font>

1829
02:19:37,747 --> 02:19:40,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.</font>

1830
02:19:42,919 --> 02:19:44,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.</font>

1831
02:19:45,338 --> 02:19:46,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lie...</font>

1832
02:19:47,465 --> 02:19:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I lied.</font>

1833
02:19:52,345 --> 02:19:53,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be all right, son.</font>

1834
02:20:32,343 --> 02:20:35,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad? Daddy, is he okay?</font>

1835
02:20:51,695 --> 02:20:53,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.</font>

1836
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

1837
02:21:00,537 --> 02:21:01,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Joker won.</font>

1838
02:21:04,291 --> 02:21:07,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...</font>

1839
02:21:07,711 --> 02:21:09,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">undone.</font>

1840
02:21:09,963 --> 02:21:14,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.</font>

1841
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:16,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">We bet it all on him.</font>

1842
02:21:17,554 --> 02:21:20,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.</font>

1843
02:21:21,015 --> 02:21:22,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">People will lose hope.</font>

1844
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't.</font>

1845
02:21:26,855 --> 02:21:28,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">They must never know what he did.</font>

1846
02:21:28,898 --> 02:21:30,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five dead.</font>

1847
02:21:31,025 --> 02:21:32,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two of them cops.</font>

1848
02:21:32,485 --> 02:21:34,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can't sweep that...
- No.</font>

1849
02:21:39,742 --> 02:21:42,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Joker cannot win.</font>

1850
02:21:47,834 --> 02:21:51,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotham needs its true hero.</font>

1851
02:21:57,426 --> 02:22:00,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You either die a hero...</font>

1852
02:22:00,638 --> 02:22:05,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.</font>

1853
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:07,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do those things...</font>

1854
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.</font>

1855
02:22:13,567 --> 02:22:16,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed those people.
That's what I can be.</font>

1856
02:22:16,612 --> 02:22:18,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, you can't. You're not.</font>

1857
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.</font>

1858
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:24,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call it in.</font>

1859
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hero.</font>

1860
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:32,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.</font>

1861
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:35,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing less than a knight...</font>

1862
02:22:36,215 --> 02:22:37,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">shining.</font>

1863
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll hunt you.</font>

1864
02:22:40,344 --> 02:22:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll hunt me.</font>

1865
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:44,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll condemn me.</font>

1866
02:22:45,307 --> 02:22:47,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set the dogs on me.</font>

1867
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's what needs to happen.</font>

1868
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because sometimes...</font>

1869
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:59,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">the truth isn't good enough.</font>

1870
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes people deserve more.</font>

1871
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:09,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.</font>

1872
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman.</font>

1873
02:23:31,602 --> 02:23:33,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batman!</font>

1874
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why's he running, Dad?</font>

1875
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we have to chase him.</font>

1876
02:23:38,651 --> 02:23:41,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!</font>

1877
02:23:47,618 --> 02:23:49,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't do anything wrong.</font>

1878
02:23:51,956 --> 02:23:57,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.</font>

1879
02:23:58,963 --> 02:23:59,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll hunt him...</font>

1880
02:24:03,133 --> 02:24:05,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">because he can take it.</font>

1881
02:24:07,721 --> 02:24:10,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's not our hero.</font>

1882
02:24:17,773 --> 02:24:18,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a silent guardian...</font>

1883
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:22,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">a watchful protector.</font>

1884
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dark knight.</font>
