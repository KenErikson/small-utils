founded as a republic.</font>

108

senate has the power.</font>

118
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a man who knows
what it is to command.</font>

119

<font color="#FFFFFF">You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.</font>

120

<font color="#FFFFFF">But these senators scheme,
squabble and flatter and deceive.</font>

121
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus, we must save Rome from
the politicians, my friend.</font>

when the time comes?</font>

123
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.</font>

earned it more.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

132
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,344

133
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder, would you
have been just?</font>

134
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,099

you taught me to be.</font>

136
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?</font>

137
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,653

With your brother.</font>

138

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the glory of
the empire, sire.</font>

155
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

156
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I remember.</font>

157
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see that map, Maximus?</font>

158
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the world
which I created.</font>

159
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 25 years,</font>

160
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:14,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have conquered, spilt
blood, expanded the empire.</font>

161
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I became Caesar, I've
known four years without war.</font>

162
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four years of peace in 20.</font>

163
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for what?</font>

164
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought the sword.
Nothing more.</font>

165
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caesar, your life...</font>

166
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please don't
call me that.</font>

167
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come. Please.</font>

168
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come sit.</font>

169
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us talk together now,</font>

170
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">very simply, as men.</font>

171
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Maximus,</font>

172
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">talk.</font>

173
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five thousand of my men are out
there in the freezing mud.</font>

174
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three thousand of them are
bloodied and cleaved.</font>

175
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two thousand will never
leave this place.</font>

176
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:10,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.</font>

177
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what would you believe?</font>

178
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">They fought for
you and for Rome.</font>

179
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is Rome, Maximus?</font>

180
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen much of the
rest of the world.</font>

181
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.</font>

182
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet you have never been there.</font>

183
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have not seen
what it has become.</font>

184
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am dying, Maximus.</font>

185
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a man sees his end,</font>

186
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.</font>

187
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">How will the world speak
my name in years to come?</font>

188
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I be known as
the philosopher?</font>

189
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">The warrior?</font>

190
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tyrant?</font>

191
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:55,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or will I be the Emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?</font>

192
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was once a
dream that was Rome.</font>

193
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could only whisper it.</font>

194
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,</font>

195
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was so fragile.</font>

196
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I fear that it will
not survive the winter.</font>

197
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus,</font>

198
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">let us whisper now,</font>

199
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">together, you and I.</font>

200
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a son.</font>

201
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:25,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about your home.</font>

202
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">My house is in the
hills above Trujillo.</font>

203
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">A very simple place.</font>

204
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pink stones that
warm in the sun.</font>

205
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,</font>

206
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jasmine in the evening.</font>

207
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Through the gate
is a giant poplar.</font>

208
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Figs, apples, pears.</font>

209
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.</font>

210
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.</font>

211
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.</font>

212
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to be one of them.</font>

213
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">When was the last
time you were home?</font>

214
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two years, 264 days
and this morning.</font>

215
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I envy you, Maximus.
It's a good home.</font>

216
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worth fighting for.</font>

217
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is one more duty</font>

218
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I ask of you
before you go home.</font>

219
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you have
me do, Caesar?</font>

220
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to become the
protector of Rome after I die.</font>

221
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will empower you
to one end alone,</font>

222
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give power back to
the people of Rome,</font>

223
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">and end the corruption
that has crippled it.</font>

224
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you accept this great
honor that I have offered you?</font>

225
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all my heart, no.</font>

226
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus,</font>

227
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is why it must be you.</font>

228
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">But surely a prefect, a senator,</font>

229
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.</font>

230
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.</font>

231
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.</font>

232
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have known that
since you were young.</font>

233
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus cannot rule.</font>

234
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must not rule.</font>

235
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the son that
I should have had.</font>

236
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus will
accept my decision.</font>

237
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:49,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.</font>

238
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need some time, sire.</font>

239
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

240
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">By sunset, I hope you
will have agreed.</font>

241
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now embrace me as my son.</font>

242
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">And bring an old man
another blanket.</font>

243
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father favors you now.
- My lady.</font>

244
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was not always so.
- Many things change.</font>

245
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many things. Not everything.</font>

246
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus, stop.</font>

247
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see your face.</font>

248
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.</font>

249
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did my father
want with you?</font>

250
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">To wish me well before
I leave for home.</font>

251
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying.</font>

252
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.</font>

253
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never acquired your
comfort with it.</font>

254
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">True.</font>

255
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you never had to.</font>

256
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is more simple
for a soldier.</font>

257
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you think me heartless?</font>

258
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you have a
talent for survival.</font>

259
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus, stop.</font>

260
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?</font>

261
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm tired from battle.</font>

262
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.</font>

263
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.</font>

264
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?</font>

265
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will always serve Rome.</font>

266
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know,</font>

267
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still remember
you in my prayers.</font>

268
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. I pray.</font>

269
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.</font>

270
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.</font>

271
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Lucius.</font>

272
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:26,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be nearly eight years old.</font>

273
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son is also nearly eight.</font>

274
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thank you for your prayers.</font>

275
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancestors, I ask
for your guidance.</font>

276
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed Mother, come to me with
the gods' desire for my future.</font>

277
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.</font>

278
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whisper to them, I live
only to hold them again.</font>

279
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,669
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ancestors, I honor you,</i></font>

280
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">and will try to live with the
dignity you have taught me.</font>

281
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cicero.</font>

282
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

283
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you ever find it
hard to do your duty?</font>

284
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I do
what I want to do.</font>

285
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest of the time,
I do what I have to.</font>

286
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We may not be able to
go home, after all.</font>

287
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:51,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready
to do your duty for Rome?</font>

288
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Father.</font>

289
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not be emperor.</font>

290
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?</font>

291
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">My powers will pass to Maximus,</font>

292
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">to hold in trust,</font>

293
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">until the Senate is ready
to rule once more.</font>

294
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rome is to be a republic again.</font>

295
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:23,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maximus.
- Yes.</font>

296
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">My decision disappoints you?</font>

297
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:37,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wrote to me once,</font>

298
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">listing the four chief virtues.</font>

299
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wisdom,</font>

300
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Justice,</font>

301
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">fortitude,</font>

302
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Temperance.</font>

303
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I read the list, I
knew I had none of them.</font>

304
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:59,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have other
virtues, Father.</font>

305
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambition.</font>

306
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">That can be a virtue when
it drives us to excel.</font>

307
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resourcefulness, courage.</font>

308
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps not on the battlefield, but
there are many forms of courage.</font>

309
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Devotion to my family,</font>

310
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">to you.</font>

311
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">But none of my virtues
were on your list.</font>

312
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even then it was as if you
didn't want me for your son.</font>

313
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus,</font>

314
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go too far.</font>

315
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">I searched the faces of the gods</font>

316
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">for ways to please you,
to make you proud.</font>

317
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">One kind word,</font>

318
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">one full hug,</font>

319
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:54,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you pressed me to your
chest and held me tight,</font>

320
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.</font>

321
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:04,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it in me
you hate so much?</font>

322
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh... Commodus.</font>

323
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I've ever wanted</font>

324
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:13,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to live up to you, Caesar.</font>

325
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Father.
- Commodus,</font>

326
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">your faults as a son</font>

327
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">is my failure as a father.</font>

328
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

329
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

330
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would butcher the whole world,</font>

331
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you would only have loved me!</font>

332
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.</font>

333
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lament with me, brother.</font>

334
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our great father is dead.</font>

335
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did he die?</font>

336
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">The surgeons
say there was no pain.</font>

337
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">His breath gave out as he slept.</font>

338
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father.</font>

339
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your emperor asks for
your loyalty, Maximus.</font>

340
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my hand.</font>

341
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only offer it once.</font>

342
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quintus.</font>

343
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Caesar.</font>

344
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.</font>

345
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.</font>

346
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sword.
- Sword.</font>

347
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:17,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.</font>

348
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:20,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prudent? The Emperor
has been slain.</font>

349
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">The emperor died
of natural causes.</font>

350
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you armed, Quintus?
Guards!</font>

351
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't fight, Maximus.</font>

352
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.</font>

353
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ride until dawn,</font>

354
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then execute him.</font>

355
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quintus, look at me. Look at me!</font>

356
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me that you will
look after my family.</font>

357

you in the afterlife.</font>

only to hold them again.</i></font>

361
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least give me a clean death.</font>

362
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">A soldier's death.</font>

363
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">The frost, sometimes it
makes the blade stick.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No. They will clean it.
Wait and see.</font>

378
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't die.</font>

379
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll feed you to the lions.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">They are worth more than we are.</font>

381
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better now?</font>

382
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clean. You see?</font>

383
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proximo!
My old friend.</font>

me, they won't mate.</font>

387
00:49:59,704 --> 00:50:03,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just walk around
eating and not mating.</font>

388
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,836

Come and see them.</font>

392
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.</font>

393

others for dying.</font>

394
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need both, I think.</font>

395
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

396
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your trade?</font>

397
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:57,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a Hunter.</font>

398
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,557

so, but who cares?</font>

alone is worth 2,000.</font>

slaves are rotten.</font>

407
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!</font>

408
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can negotiate.</font>

409
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:33,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you 2,000, and
4,000 for the beasts.</font>

410
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 5,000 for an old friend.</font>

411
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?</font>

412

brought you screaming into this world.</font>

for you for your company.</font>

417
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.</font>

Red.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You will need their help today.</font>

457
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proximo!</font>

458
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:55,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still leading with the German?</font>

459
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crowd
love a barbarian.</font>

460
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides that, he's
making me rich.</font>

461
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has that Numidian fought before?</font>

462
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, first time.</font>

463
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that one,
laborer, soldier?</font>

464
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Spaniard.</font>

465
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might as well be a eunuch for
what he brings to the ring.</font>

466
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:18,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">500 sestertii, the Numidian and
Spaniard team makes it through.</font>

467
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.</font>

468
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you asking me to bet
against my own man?</font>

469
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unethical.</font>

470
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:32,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I make it 2,000?</font>

471
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some of you are thinking
you won't fight,</font>

472
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">some that you can't fight.</font>

473
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all say that until
they're out there.</font>

474
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

475
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!</font>

476
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thrust this into
another man's flesh,</font>

477
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they will applaud
and love you for that.</font>

478
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:18,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you,</font>

479
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may begin to love them</font>

480
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">for that.</font>

481
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultimately, we're all dead men.</font>

482
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, we cannot choose how,</font>

483
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we can decide how
we meet that end,</font>

484
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order that we are remembered</font>

485
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">as men.</font>

486
00:58:47,606 --> 00:58:48,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

487
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the left,
draw your shields!</font>

488
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the right, draw your swords!</font>

489
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!</font>

490
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pair them up,
red with yellow.</font>

491
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next!</font>

492
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:16,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

493
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usurper!</font>

494
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!</font>

495
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?</font>

496
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.</font>

497
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he could do very well.</font>

498
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:43,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Rome, or for you?</font>

499
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.</font>

500
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucius!
- Mother!</font>

501
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail, Caesar.</font>

502
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senators.</font>

503
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rome greets her new emperor.</font>

504
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your loyal subjects bid
you welcome, Highness.</font>

505
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Falco.</font>

506
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for the loyal subjects, I
trust they weren't too expensive.</font>

507
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Caesar.
- Gracchus.</font>

508
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:27,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Rome rejoices in
your return, Caesar.</font>

509
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are many matters
that require your attention.</font>

510
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">To order, please.
To order.</font>

511
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your guidance, Caesar,</font>

512
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols</font>

513
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">to begin addressing the
many problems in the city,</font>

514
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:48,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,</font>

515
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">to combat the plague which is
already springing up there.</font>

516
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if Caesar...</font>

517
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see, Gracchus?</font>

518
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the very
problem, isn't it?</font>

519
01:05:03,023 --> 01:05:05,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father spent all
his time at study,</font>

520
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">at books of learning
and philosophy.</font>

521
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.</font>

522
01:05:16,286 --> 01:05:19,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all the while, the
people were forgotten.</font>

523
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the senate is
the people, sire,</font>

524
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.</font>

525
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt many of the people eat
so well as you do, Gracchus.</font>

526
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or have such splendid
mistresses, Gaius.</font>

527
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I understand
my own people.</font>

528
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us,</font>

529
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:42,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of his own
extensive experience.</font>

530
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I call it love.</font>

531
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am their father. The
people are my children.</font>

532
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:54,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I shall hold them to my
bosom and embrace them tightly.</font>

533
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?</font>

534
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but if you
interrupt me again,</font>

535
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you that you shall.</font>

536
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senator, my brother
is very tired.</font>

537
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:17,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave your list with me. Caesar
shall do all that Rome requires.</font>

538
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:22,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.</font>

539
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are they to lecture me?</font>

540
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:34,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus, the Senate
has its uses.</font>

541
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:37,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">What uses? All they do is talk.</font>

542
01:06:38,952 --> 01:06:43,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be just you
and me and Rome.</font>

543
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even think it. There's
always been a Senate.</font>

544
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rome has changed.</font>

545
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes an emperor
to rule an empire.</font>

546
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, but leave
the people their...</font>

547
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">illusions?</font>

548
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:59,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traditions.</font>

549
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's war against
the barbarians.</font>

550
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:07,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.</font>

551
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people always
love victories.</font>

552
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? They didn't
see the battles.</font>

553
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they care
about Germania?</font>

554
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:18,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">They care about the
greatness of Rome.</font>

555
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The greatness of Rome."</font>

556
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what is that?</font>

557
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:30,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an idea. Greatness.</font>

558
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:37,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.</font>

559
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:41,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you not see, Lucilia?</font>

560
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:46,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give the people a vision of
Rome, and they'll love me for it.</font>

561
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.</font>

562
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give the people the
greatest vision of their lives.</font>

563
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">White and red wine for
your drinking pleasure!</font>

564
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Games.</font>

565
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hundred and fifty
days of games.</font>

566
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's cleverer than I thought.</font>

567
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,</font>

568
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.</font>

569
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear and wonder. A
powerful combination.</font>

570
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think the people are
going to be seduced by that?</font>

571
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.</font>

572
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conjure magic for them, and
they'll be distracted.</font>

573
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.</font>

574
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beating heart of Rome is
not the marble of the Senate.</font>

575
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:49,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the sand of the Colosseum.</font>

576
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:53,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll bring them death,</font>

577
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they will love him for it.</font>

578
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:22,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you do is kill, kill, kill.</font>

579
01:10:22,467 --> 01:10:24,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crowd don't want a
butcher, they want a hero.</font>

580
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">We want them to
keep coming back.</font>

581
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:31,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.</font>

582
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spaniard.</font>

583
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:44,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">So entertain!</font>

584
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?</font>

585
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this not why you're here?</font>

586
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:05,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!</font>

587
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!</font>

588
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

589
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girl?</font>

590
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy?</font>

591
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.</font>

592
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're good, Spaniard, but
you're not that good.</font>

593
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could be magnificent.</font>

594
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:43,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.</font>

595
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough for the
provinces, but not for Rome.</font>

596
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles</font>

597
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:58,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">to commemorate his
father, Marcus Aurelius.</font>

598
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find that amusing,</font>

599
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">since it was Marcus
Aurelius, the wise,</font>

600
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:08,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">the all-knowing Marcus
Aurelius, that closed us down.</font>

601
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:15,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">So finally, after five years
of scratching a living</font>

602
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">in flea-infested villages,</font>

603
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're finally going back
to where we belong.</font>

604
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Colosseum.</font>

605
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see the
Colosseum, Spaniard.</font>

606
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty thousand Romans,</font>

607
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:36,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">watching every movement
of your sword,</font>

608
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:40,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">willing you to make
that killer blow.</font>

609
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:44,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.</font>

610
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:49,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">It rises. It rises up,</font>

611
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">like a storm.</font>

612
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if you were the
thunder god himself.</font>

613
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:58,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.</font>

614
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:07,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won your freedom?</font>

615
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:09,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">A long time ago, the Emperor</font>

616
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:13,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">presented me with a rudius.</font>

617
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:16,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a wooden sword.</font>

618
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">The symbol of your freedom.</font>

619
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">He touched me on the
shoulder, and I was free.</font>

620
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew Marcus Aurelius?</font>

621
01:14:29,422 --> 01:14:33,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not say I knew him. I said he
touched me on the shoulder once.</font>

622
01:14:34,302 --> 01:14:36,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked me what I want.</font>

623
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:40,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, too, want to stand in
front of the Emperor,</font>

624
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:43,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">as you did.</font>

625
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:46,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then listen to me.
Learn from me.</font>

626
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't the best because
I killed quickly.</font>

627
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the best because
the crowd loved me.</font>

628
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:59,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Win the crowd, and
you'll win your freedom.</font>

629
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will win the crowd.</font>

630
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:11,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give them something
they've never seen before.</font>

631
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Spaniard, we shall
go to Rome together</font>

632
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">and have bloody adventures.</font>

633
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the great whore
will suckle us</font>

634
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.</font>

635
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:23,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then,</font>

636
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">when enough men have died,</font>

637
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps you will
have your freedom.</font>

638
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Use this.</font>

639
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's somewhere out
there, my country.</font>

640
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">My home.</font>

641
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife is preparing food.</font>

642
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughters carry
water from the river.</font>

643
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will I ever see them again?</font>

644
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:20,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, no.</font>

645
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?</font>

646
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.</font>

647
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:28,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then, I will die soon.</font>

648
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will not die
for many years.</font>

649
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to wait.</font>

650
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you would? Wait?</font>

651
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

652
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see,</font>

653
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:47,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">my wife and my son</font>

654
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">are already waiting for me.</font>

655
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll meet them again.
But not yet.</font>

656
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

657
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unless...
- Not yet.</font>

658
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

659
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:23,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

660
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out.</font>

661
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, go, out!</font>

662
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good to see you
again, old friend.</font>

663
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:39,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me fortune.</font>

664
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever seen
anything like that before?</font>

665
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know men could
build such things.</font>

666
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Win the crowd.</font>

667
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get inside. Move.</font>

668
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:05,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside.</font>

669
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sleeps so well
because he's loved.</font>

670
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, brother. It's late.</font>

671
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:09,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.</font>

672
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is what Gracchus and his
friends don't understand.</font>

673
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:19,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.</font>

674
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commodus, drink this tonic.</font>

675
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the time
is almost right.</font>

676
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:44,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could announce the
dissolution of the Senate</font>

677
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the celebration
to honor our father.</font>

678
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I should?</font>

679
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the people ready?</font>

680
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you need your rest now.</font>

681
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you stay with me?</font>

682
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:05,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still afraid of the
dark, brother?</font>

683
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still.</font>

684
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

685
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.</font>

686
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:27,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then kiss me.</font>

687
01:21:36,307 --> 01:21:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sleep, brother.</font>

688
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having servants who
are deaf and mute</font>

689
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">at least ensures I
live a little longer.</font>

690
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're
arresting scholars now.</font>

691
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone who dare speak out. Even
satirists and chroniclers.</font>

692
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">And mathematicians.</font>

693
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all to feed the arena.</font>

694
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Senate did not
approve martial law.</font>

695
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">This reign of terror is
entirely the Praetorians.</font>

696
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid to go out after dark.</font>

697
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:03,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be more afraid of
your activities during the day.</font>

698
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:08,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.</font>

699
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:14,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what is in his mind? That's
what I trouble myself with.</font>

700
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,</font>

701
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">planning the festival
to honor your father.</font>

702
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.</font>

703
01:23:25,082 --> 01:23:27,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">So just what is he planning?</font>

704
01:23:27,668 --> 01:23:29,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what pays for it?</font>

705
01:23:29,378 --> 01:23:33,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">These daily games are costing a
fortune, yet we have no new taxes.</font>

706
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The future.</font>

707
01:23:37,136 --> 01:23:39,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">The future pays for it.</font>

708
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's started selling
the grain reserves.</font>

709
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be true.</font>

710
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.</font>

711
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:52,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people will be
starving in two years.</font>

712
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope they're
enjoying the games,</font>

713
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">because soon enough they'll
be dead because of them.</font>

714
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rome must know this.
- And how?</font>

715
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:03,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going to
dissolve the Senate.</font>

716
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:07,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who will tell them before
it's too late? You, Gracchus?</font>

717
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, Gaius.</font>

718
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:11,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you make a speech on
the floor of the Senate,</font>

719
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">denouncing my brother?</font>

720
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:16,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then see your family
in the Colosseum?</font>

721
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who'd dare?</font>

722
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been living in a
prison of fear every day,</font>

723
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">because my son is
heir to the throne.</font>

724
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must die.</font>

725
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quintus and
the Praetorians</font>

726
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:49,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">would simply seize
control for themselves.</font>

727
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:53,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Cut off the head and
the snake cannot strike.</font>

728
01:24:53,337 --> 01:24:55,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucilia,
Gaius is right.</font>

729
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until we can neutralize the
Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.</font>

730
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we do nothing?</font>

731
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, child.
We keep our counsel.</font>

732
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">We prepare.</font>

733
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:13,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as the people support
him, we are voices without steel.</font>

734
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are air.</font>

735
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with every day that
passes, he makes enemies.</font>

736
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:24,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, he'll have more
enemies than friends.</font>

737
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on that day, we will act.</font>

738
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we will strike.</font>

739
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:32,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">But until then,</font>

740
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:35,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are docile.</font>

741
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:38,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are obedient.</font>

742
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are treacherous.</font>

743
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

744
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, that's enough.</font>

745
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Emperor
wants battles,</font>

746
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:28,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't want to
sacrifice my best fighters.</font>

747
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crowd wants battles, so the
Emperor gives them battles.</font>

748
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.</font>

749
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, why don't you go
down to the prison,</font>

750
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">round up all the
beggars and thieves?</font>

751
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:42,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've done that.</font>

752
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:45,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to give away
the best gladiators</font>

753
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the whole of the empire,</font>

754
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,493

powerful than the emperor of Rome.</font>

907
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gods have spared me?</font>

908
01:47:26,439 --> 01:47:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am at their mercy, with the
power only to amuse a mob.</font>

909
01:47:29,984 --> 01:47:31,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is power.</font>

910
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mob is Rome.</font>

911
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">And while Commodus controls
them, he controls everything.</font>

912
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.</font>

913
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:42,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.</font>

914
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:44,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">But while the people follow him,</font>

915
01:47:44,832 --> 01:47:47,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">no one would dare stand
up to him until you.</font>

916
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">They oppose him, yet
they do nothing.</font>

917
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:54,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.</font>

918
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">One man above all.</font>

919
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:00,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?</font>

920
01:48:01,307 --> 01:48:03,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you not understand?</font>

921
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:07,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may die in this cell tonight, or
in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!</font>

922
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What possible
difference can I make?</font>

923
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man wants what you want.</font>

924
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:15,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then have him kill Commodus!</font>

925
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew a man once,</font>

926
01:48:20,618 --> 01:48:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">a noble man.</font>

927
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man of principle
who loved my father,</font>

928
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my father loved him.</font>

929
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:32,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man served Rome well.</font>

930
01:48:37,301 --> 01:48:39,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man is gone.</font>

931
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your brother did his work well.</font>

932
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help you.</font>

933
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:53,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you can help me.</font>

934
01:48:56,404 --> 01:49:00,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.</font>

935
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guard! The lady is
finished with me.</font>

936
01:49:34,984 --> 01:49:36,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

937
01:49:39,655 --> 01:49:41,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Julian Crassus.</font>

938
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:47,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Name?</font>

939
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus, sire.</font>

940
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father's name.</font>

941
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:03,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">They must have known
of Maximus' escape,</font>

942
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:06,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they found the
bodies of the four men.</font>

943
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">They thought it was
a barbarian raid.</font>

944
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.</font>

945
01:50:20,613 --> 01:50:22,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Load your arrows!</font>

946
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare to fire!</font>

947
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then perhaps it
was you who knew,</font>

948
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">and never told me.</font>

949
01:50:58,484 --> 01:51:00,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?</font>

950
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a general is
always in control.</font>

951
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:10,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always in command, isn't he?</font>

952
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:13,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Caesar.</font>

953
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then give the command. Say it.</font>

954
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire.</font>

955
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:24,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus.</font>

956
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You commanded legions?
You had many victories?</font>

957
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- In Germania?</font>

958
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:34,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">In many countries.</font>

959
01:52:36,582 --> 01:52:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

960
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:28,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a great name.</font>

961
01:53:30,386 --> 01:53:33,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must kill your name
before he kills you.</font>

962
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:43,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, at the far end.</font>

963
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.</font>

964
01:53:46,235 --> 01:53:48,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senator Gracchus.</font>

965
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:53,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't often see you enjoying the
pleasures of the vulgar crowd.</font>

966
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't pretend to be a man
of the people, Senator,</font>

967
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:58,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do try to be a
man for the people.</font>

968
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:17,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!</font>

969
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!</font>

970
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:26,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">People of Rome!</font>

971
01:54:28,944 --> 01:54:31,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the fourth day of Antioch,</font>

972
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:36,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can celebrate the
64th day of the games.</font>

973
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in his majestic Charity,</font>

974
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:46,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome</font>

975
01:54:46,837 --> 01:54:50,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">with an historical final match.</font>

976
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:55,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,</font>

977
01:54:57,056 --> 01:55:00,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caesar is pleased to bring you</font>

978
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:04,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only undefeated champion</font>

979
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Roman history,</font>

980
01:55:06,524 --> 01:55:11,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">the legendary Tigris of Gaul!</font>

981
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows too well how
to manipulate the mob.</font>

982
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:38,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.</font>

983
01:55:39,056 --> 01:55:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not it. This is not it!</font>

984
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus Aurelius
is dead, Maximus.</font>

985
01:55:45,604 --> 01:55:48,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">We mortals are but
shadows and dust.</font>

986
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shadows and dust, Maximus!</font>

987
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:54,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,</font>

988
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:58,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caesar is proud to give you.</font>

989
01:55:58,784 --> 01:56:02,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aelius Maximus!</font>

990
01:56:15,426 --> 01:56:17,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">They embrace him like
he's one of their own.</font>

991
01:56:17,887 --> 01:56:21,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.</font>

992
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, much sooner than that.</font>

993
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been arranged.</font>

994
01:56:49,627 --> 01:56:52,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">We who are about
to die salute you.</font>

995
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're with you, Maximus!</font>

996
01:57:40,302 --> 01:57:42,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight on, finish it!</font>

997
01:58:10,332 --> 01:58:12,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull, pull!</font>

998
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loose! Loose!</font>

999
01:59:14,021 --> 01:59:16,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gut him!
- Kill!</font>

1000
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:21,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!</font>

1001
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill!
- Kill!</font>

1002
02:00:21,506 --> 02:00:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus the Merciful!</font>

1003
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:36,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!</font>

1004
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:38,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!</font>

1005
02:00:45,863 --> 02:00:48,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forward, arms at ready!</font>

1006
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:20,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I going to do with you?</font>

1007
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:25,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You simply won't die.</font>

1008
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we so different, you and I?</font>

1009
02:01:33,744 --> 02:01:36,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take life when you
have to, as I do.</font>

1010
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.</font>

1011
02:01:42,252 --> 02:01:44,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then take it now.</font>

1012
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tell me your son</font>

1013
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:03,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">squealed like a girl when
they nailed him to the cross.</font>

1014
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your wife</font>

1015
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:10,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">moaned like a whore</font>

1016
02:02:11,865 --> 02:02:16,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">when they ravaged
her again and again</font>

1017
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">and again.</font>

1018
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,</font>

1019
02:02:32,761 --> 02:02:34,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Highness.</font>

1020
02:02:48,403 --> 02:02:51,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!</font>

1021
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:07,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">General! General!</font>

1022
02:03:09,506 --> 02:03:11,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- General!
- Cicero!</font>

1023
02:03:18,765 --> 02:03:20,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- General!
- Where are you camped?</font>

1024
02:03:20,350 --> 02:03:21,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ostia.</font>

1025
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:31,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the Victor!</font>

1026
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.</font>

1027
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:35,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Move along!
- Find me!</font>

1028
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:03,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can they hear you?</font>

1029
02:04:07,023 --> 02:04:10,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.</font>

1030
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:15,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- What do you say to them?</font>

1031
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">To my boy,</font>

1032
02:04:22,537 --> 02:04:25,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell him I will
see him again soon,</font>

1033
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:28,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.</font>

1034
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">To my wife,</font>

1035
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:36,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is not your business.</font>

1036
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:46,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now they love
Maximus for his mercy.</font>

1037
02:04:48,105 --> 02:04:51,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can't just kill him, or it
makes me even more unmerciful.</font>

1038
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:57,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole thing is like
some great nightmare.</font>

1039
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is defying you.</font>

1040
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:03,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">His every victory is
an act of defiance.</font>

1041
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:07,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mob sees this, and
so do the Senate.</font>

1042
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:11,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.</font>

1043
02:05:12,671 --> 02:05:14,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill him.
- No.</font>

1044
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not make a martyr of him.</font>

1045
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:28,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I went to the Senate today,</font>

1046
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:32,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I purposefully told them about using the
grain reserves to pay for the games.</font>

1047
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:36,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did you note what happened?</font>

1048
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:40,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.</font>

1049
02:05:41,283 --> 02:05:43,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a single word of protest.</font>

1050
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:47,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the insolent Senator
Gracchus was silent as a mouse.</font>

1051
02:05:47,414 --> 02:05:48,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1052
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:54,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been told of
a certain sea snake</font>

1053
02:05:54,087 --> 02:05:58,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">which has a very unusual
method of attracting its prey.</font>

1054
02:05:58,592 --> 02:06:02,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.</font>

1055
02:06:03,305 --> 02:06:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then its enemies will approach,</font>

1056
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet it will lie quite still.</font>

1057
02:06:09,145 --> 02:06:12,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then its enemies will
take little bites of it,</font>

1058
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:16,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet it remains still.</font>

1059
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:20,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">So,</font>

1060
02:06:22,033 --> 02:06:23,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">we will lie still,</font>

1061
02:06:24,534 --> 02:06:27,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let our enemies
come to us and nibble.</font>

1062
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:31,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have every senator followed.</font>

1063
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:50,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cicero, my old friend.</font>

1064
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought perhaps I'd seen
you for the last time.</font>

1065
02:06:52,729 --> 02:06:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought you were dead.
- Close.</font>

1066
02:06:55,358 --> 02:06:56,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have the
men been in Ostia?</font>

1067
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">All winter.</font>

1068
02:06:58,735 --> 02:07:02,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.</font>

1069
02:07:02,739 --> 02:07:05,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.</font>

1070
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?</font>

1071
02:07:09,329 --> 02:07:11,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">For you, tomorrow.</font>

1072
02:07:12,582 --> 02:07:15,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to do
something for me.</font>

1073
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:21,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, see, witness.</font>

1074
02:07:21,216 --> 02:07:24,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.</font>

1075
02:07:24,345 --> 02:07:27,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giant Maximus is defeating
our emperor, Commodus.</font>

1076
02:07:28,056 --> 02:07:30,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we to do? He's
just defying everyone,</font>

1077
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:32,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">by doing this to him, they do...</font>

1078
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">My goodness!</font>

1079
02:07:36,815 --> 02:07:40,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!</font>

1080
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:49,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">My lady? I served your
father at Vindobona.</font>

1081
02:07:49,162 --> 02:07:50,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back.
My lady.</font>

1082
02:07:50,787 --> 02:07:53,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I served your
father at Vindobona.</font>

1083
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:54,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back!</font>

1084
02:07:54,457 --> 02:07:57,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.</font>

1085
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:00,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Stop.</font>

1086
02:08:01,298 --> 02:08:02,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

1087
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:04,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand back.</font>

1088
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:09,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The general sends word, he
will meet your politician.</font>

1089
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:14,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.</font>

1090
02:08:23,904 --> 02:08:25,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us.</font>

1091
02:08:30,953 --> 02:08:32,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Senator Gracchus.</font>

1092
02:08:46,469 --> 02:08:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

1093
02:08:48,845 --> 02:08:51,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope my coming here
today is evidence enough</font>

1094
02:08:51,681 --> 02:08:54,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you can trust me.</font>

1095
02:08:59,064 --> 02:09:01,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?</font>

1096
02:09:03,027 --> 02:09:05,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. I can speak for them.</font>

1097
02:09:06,363 --> 02:09:09,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can buy my freedom and
smuggle me out of Rome?</font>

1098
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:11,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what end?</font>

1099
02:09:12,994 --> 02:09:15,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me outside the city walls.</font>

1100
02:09:15,914 --> 02:09:19,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.</font>

1101
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:23,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">By nightfall of the second day, I shall
return at the head of 5,000 men.</font>

1102
02:09:23,296 --> 02:09:25,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the legions all
have new commanders,</font>

1103
02:09:25,632 --> 02:09:27,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">loyal to Commodus.</font>

1104
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:30,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.</font>

1105
02:09:30,387 --> 02:09:32,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is madness.</font>

1106
02:09:32,722 --> 02:09:36,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.</font>

1107
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:38,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not trade one
dictatorship for another!</font>

1108
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:42,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.</font>

1109
02:09:42,565 --> 02:09:45,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after your glorious
coup, what then?</font>

1110
02:09:46,862 --> 02:09:50,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll take your 5,000
warriors and leave?</font>

1111
02:09:50,573 --> 02:09:52,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will leave.</font>

1112
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:54,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">The soldiers will stay
for your protection,</font>

1113
02:09:54,744 --> 02:09:56,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the command of the Senate.</font>

1114
02:09:56,538 --> 02:09:57,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">So,</font>

1115
02:09:58,039 --> 02:10:02,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">once all of Rome is yours, you'll
just give it back to the people?</font>

1116
02:10:03,628 --> 02:10:04,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me why.</font>

1117
02:10:10,761 --> 02:10:13,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that was the last
wish of a dying man.</font>

1118
02:10:16,975 --> 02:10:18,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will kill Commodus.</font>

1119
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:23,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fate of Rome I leave to you.</font>

1120
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:27,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus Aurelius trusted you.</font>

1121
02:10:29,738 --> 02:10:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">His daughter trusts you.</font>

1122
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:37,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will trust you.</font>

1123
02:10:37,872 --> 02:10:39,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have little time.</font>

1124
02:10:40,457 --> 02:10:42,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me two days,</font>

1125
02:10:43,002 --> 02:10:45,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will buy your freedom.</font>

1126
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you,</font>

1127
02:10:48,757 --> 02:10:50,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">you stay alive,</font>

1128
02:10:51,844 --> 02:10:53,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll be dead.</font>

1129
02:10:55,472 --> 02:10:57,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we must go.</font>

1130
02:11:24,126 --> 02:11:27,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.</font>

1131
02:11:27,796 --> 02:11:29,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll find you.</font>

1132
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:15,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't work.</font>

1133
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Emperor knows too much.</font>

1134
02:12:18,847 --> 02:12:19,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as for me,</font>

1135
02:12:22,184 --> 02:12:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's becoming dangerous.</font>

1136
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be paid on my return.</font>

1137
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:31,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give you my word.</font>

1138
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:34,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your word? What if
you don't return?</font>

1139
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?</font>

1140
02:12:39,284 --> 02:12:40,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust?</font>

1141
02:12:44,789 --> 02:12:46,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who am I to trust?</font>

1142
02:12:47,126 --> 02:12:50,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?</font>

1143
02:12:51,087 --> 02:12:52,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He makes me rich.</font>

1144
02:12:57,927 --> 02:13:00,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that you are a man
of your word, General.</font>

1145
02:13:02,515 --> 02:13:05,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that you would
die for honor.</font>

1146
02:13:06,436 --> 02:13:08,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would die for Rome.</font>

1147
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:12,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would die for the
memory of your ancestors.</font>

1148
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:14,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I, on the other hand,</font>

1149
02:13:17,655 --> 02:13:19,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an entertainer.</font>

1150
02:13:22,994 --> 02:13:24,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guard!</font>

1151
02:13:29,042 --> 02:13:31,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed the man
who set you free.</font>

1152
02:13:40,804 --> 02:13:42,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praetorians, master.</font>

1153
02:13:48,811 --> 02:13:49,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halt!</font>

1154
02:14:55,128 --> 02:14:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have you been?</font>

1155
02:14:57,381 --> 02:14:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent for you.</font>

1156
02:15:00,551 --> 02:15:02,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, brother.</font>

1157
02:15:07,975 --> 02:15:09,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's troubling you?</font>

1158
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:14,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does Gracchus have a new lover?</font>

1159
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:17,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1160
02:15:19,944 --> 02:15:22,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd seen him.</font>

1161
02:15:22,905 --> 02:15:25,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.</font>

1162
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:30,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.</font>

1163
02:15:30,831 --> 02:15:32,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he will bleed, too.</font>

1164
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:35,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very soon.</font>

1165
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:38,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not tonight.</font>

1166
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:56,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember what
our father said once?</font>

1167
02:15:57,565 --> 02:15:59,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">"It's a dream,"</font>

1168
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:03,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">"a frightful dream,"</font>

1169
02:16:05,573 --> 02:16:06,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">"life is."</font>

1170
02:16:09,619 --> 02:16:11,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think that's true?</font>

1171
02:16:12,456 --> 02:16:13,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1172
02:16:17,543 --> 02:16:19,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it is.</font>

1173
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have only you
to share it with.</font>

1174
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your mouth.</font>

1175
02:17:41,085 --> 02:17:42,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I love you.</font>

1176
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:46,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I love you.</font>

1177
02:18:23,211 --> 02:18:24,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out. Get out!</font>

1178
02:18:25,963 --> 02:18:27,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

1179
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:33,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, General.</font>

1180
02:18:34,013 --> 02:18:36,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got very
persuasive friends.</font>

1181
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother has had
Gracchus arrested.</font>

1182
02:18:45,399 --> 02:18:48,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.</font>

1183
02:18:48,945 --> 02:18:52,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.</font>

1184
02:18:53,242 --> 02:18:56,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your servant, Cicero, will be
waiting there with horses.</font>

1185
02:18:58,914 --> 02:19:01,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have done all this?
- Yes.</font>

1186
02:19:02,416 --> 02:19:04,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">You risk too much.</font>

1187
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:07,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have much to pay for.</font>

1188
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:11,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have nothing to pay for.</font>

1189
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:14,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">You love your son.
You're strong for him.</font>

1190
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am tired of being strong.</font>

1191
02:19:22,396 --> 02:19:26,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother hates all the
world, and you most of all.</font>

1192
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:30,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because your father chose me.
- No.</font>

1193
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:33,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because my father loved you.</font>

1194
02:19:37,702 --> 02:19:40,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because I loved you.</font>

1195
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:44,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">A long time ago.</font>

1196
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:51,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I very different then?</font>

1197
02:19:57,806 --> 02:19:59,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You laughed more.</font>

1198
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have felt alone all my life,</font>

1199
02:20:07,356 --> 02:20:09,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">except with you.</font>

1200
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:13,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must go.</font>

1201
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:15,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1202
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:44,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

1203
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:58,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got you.</font>

1204
02:21:01,077 --> 02:21:02,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't it late to be
playing legionnaire?</font>

1205
02:21:03,079 --> 02:21:05,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a legionnaire.</font>

Yes, she did.</font>

1216
02:21:53,547 --> 02:21:55,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">She took it from a basket,</font>

1217

1235
02:22:56,692 --> 02:22:58,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">By his own blood.</font>

1236
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:02,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">They whispered in dark corners</font>

1237
02:23:02,324 --> 02:23:04,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">and went out late at night,</font>

1238
02:23:04,868 --> 02:23:08,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">and conspired, and conspired.</font>

1239
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.</font>

1240
02:23:14,795 --> 02:23:17,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew they were
busy little bees.</font>

1241
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:22,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one night he sat
down with one of them,</font>

1242
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he looked at her,</font>

1243
02:23:25,888 --> 02:23:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he said,</font>

1244
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tell me what
you've been doing,"</font>

1245

bathe in their blood."</font>

1248
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:49,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Emperor was heartbroken.</font>

1249
02:23:51,372 --> 02:23:53,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little bee had
wounded him more deeply</font>

1250
02:23:53,666 --> 02:23:56,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">than anyone else could
ever have done.</font>

1251
02:23:58,504 --> 02:24:01,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think
happened then, Lucius?</font>

1252
02:24:02,007 --> 02:24:03,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, Uncle.</font>
