00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

451
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:16,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember
giving you a key.</font>

452
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:20,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think I'd need one?</font>

453
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:24,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife kicked me out.</font>

454
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you were married.</font>

455
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:30,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of things you
don't know about me.</font>

456
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:33,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, Nick.
That's the problem.</font>

457
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:51,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to have to do this, but
I had no place else to crash.</font>

458
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:00,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else knows about your wife?</font>

459
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just...</font>

460
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends.</font>

461
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what we are?</font>

462
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:12,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's up to you.</font>

463
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:34,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't trust anyone.</font>

464
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:38,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Rogers?</font>

465
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assigned to protect you.</font>

469
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">On whose order?</font>

470
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:51,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">His.</font>

471
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,635

he's unresponsive.</font>

472

474
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:03,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him I'm in pursuit.</font>

475
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he gonna make it?</font>

476
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:06,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

477
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:08,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about the shooter.</font>

478
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:11,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fast. Strong.</font>

479
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had a metal arm.</font>

480
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ballistics?</font>

481
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:26,088

489
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,472

507
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

508
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cap, they want you
back at S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

509
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, give me a second.</font>

510
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want you now.</font>

511
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,641

512
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,940

515
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,827

516
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- Yeah.</font>

517
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:21,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.</font>

00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:37,710

522
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:46,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, it's an honor.</font>

523
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:47,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">The honor's mine, Captain.</font>

524
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:50,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.</font>

525
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:54,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">That photo was taken five
years after Nick and I met,</font>

526
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was at State
Department in Bogota.</font>

527
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,</font>

528
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:04,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and security got me out, but
the rebels took hostages.</font>

529
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:07,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick was Deputy Chief of the S.H.I.E.L.D.
station there,</font>

530
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he comes to me with a plan.</font>

531
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.</font>

532
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "No, we'll negotiate."</font>

533
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.</font>

534
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?</font>

535
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">They find it empty.</font>

536
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:25,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick had ignored
my direct order,</font>

537
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,</font>

538
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,</font>

539
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:33,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">including my daughter.</font>

540
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:35,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you gave him a promotion.</font>

541
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never had any
cause to regret it.</font>

542
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?</font>

543
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:46,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

544
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:49,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know it was bugged?</font>

545
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:52,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, because Nick told me.</font>

546
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:55,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?</font>

547
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to see something.</font>

548
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,494
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i></font>

549
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:06,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that live?</font>

550
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:10,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.</font>

551
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:14,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.</font>

552
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:17,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. It's more
complicated than that.</font>

553
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:20,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.</font>

554
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:24,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,</font>

555
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:29,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.</font>

556
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:31,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last one going
to a holding company</font>

557
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.</font>

558
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:35,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I supposed to
know who that is?</font>

559
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:37,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.</font>

560
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.</font>

561
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:44,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I first met Nick, his
mother lived at 1437.</font>

562
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:49,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?</font>

563
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prevailing theory</font>

564
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">was that the hijacking was a
cover for the acquisition</font>

565
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:58,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sale of classified
intelligence.</font>

566
00:43:59,782 --> 00:44:03,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.</font>

567
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:08,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.</font>

568
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think we're talking?</font>

569
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,</font>

570
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:22,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.</font>

571
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,</font>

572
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:31,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">to build a really better world</font>

573
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:35,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.</font>

574
00:44:36,952 --> 00:44:38,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that makes enemies.</font>

575
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:43,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts</font>

576
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:47,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.</font>

577
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:51,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the idea that those
people could be happy today</font>

578
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:55,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes me really, really angry.</font>

579
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.</font>

580
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:03,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
that's an accident.</font>

581
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't think
you do, either.</font>

582
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:09,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'm gonna ask again.</font>

583
00:45:09,552 --> 00:45:11,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was he there?</font>

584
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:17,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me not to trust anyone.</font>

585
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if that included him.</font>

586
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

587
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were his last words.</font>

588
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

589
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain,</font>

590
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.</font>

591
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:43,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.</font>

592
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:46,329

the pirates, didn't you?</font>

654
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:23,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.</font>

655
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:24,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna ask you again.</font>

him the Winter Soldier.</font>

two dozen assassinations</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">in the last 50 years.</font>

661
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:43,661

662
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody shot out my
tires near Odessa.</font>

664
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:51,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost control, went
straight over a cliff.</font>

665
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled us out.</font>

666
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Winter
Soldier was there.</font>

667
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:58,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was covering my
engineer so he shot him</font>

668
00:52:58,577 --> 00:53:00,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">straight through me.</font>

669
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soviet slug.</font>

670
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.</font>

671
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.</font>

672
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:13,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.</font>

673
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:17,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like you said, he's
a ghost story.</font>

674
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.</font>

675
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,280
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nick Fury was murdered
in cold blood.</i></font>

676
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:27,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">To any reasonable person,</font>

677
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">that would make him a
martyr, not a traitor.</font>

678
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what makes
him a traitor?</font>

679
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:34,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship.</font>

680
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick Fury used your friendship</font>

681
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:40,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.</font>

682
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.</font>

683
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:46,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">At best, he lied to you.
At worst...</font>

684
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you calling for
my resignation?</font>

685
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got a pen and
paper right here.</font>

686
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.</font>

687
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you do want to
have a discussion?</font>

688
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've already had it, Mr.
Secretary.</font>

689
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:03,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.</font>

690
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:08,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to say something
snappy, now would be a good time.</font>

691
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">First rule of going on the
run is don't run, walk.</font>

692
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:20,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.</font>

693
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up</font>

694
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.</font>

695
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much time will we have?</font>

696
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">About nine minutes from</font>

697
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">now.</font>

698
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fury was right about that ship.</font>

699
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's trying
to hide something.</font>

700
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.</font>

701
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.</font>

702
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you override it?</font>

703
00:54:50,653 --> 00:54:53,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.</font>

704
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:55,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slightly.</font>

705
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:07,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna try running a tracer.</font>

706
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D.
developed</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">to track hostile malware,</font>

708
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if we can't read the file,</font>

709
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe we can find out
where it came from.</font>

710
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help you guys
with anything?</font>

711
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:21,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.</font>

712
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:23,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. We're getting married.</font>

713
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations. Where are you
guys thinking about going?</font>

714
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:29,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">New Jersey.</font>

practically twins.</font>

717
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I wish.</font>

718
00:55:40,568 --> 00:55:42,146

I've been Aaron.</font>

720

721
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.</font>

722
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

723
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:57,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it?</font>

724
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:00,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to. Let's go.</font>

725
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standard tac team.</font>

726

728
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they make us, I'll engage, you hit
the south escalator to the metro.</font>

729
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:11,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.</font>

730
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,206

- Do it.</font>

731
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negative at the source.</font>

Work down to me.</font>

736
00:56:36,724 --> 00:56:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kiss me.
- What?</font>

737
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.</font>

738
00:56:40,161 --> 00:56:41,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they do.</font>

739
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still uncomfortable?</font>

740
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not exactly the
word I would use.</font>

741

learn how to steal a car?</font>

which you do not have to answer.</font>

745
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:20,498

don't answer it though,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?</font>

747
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:24,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that your first

lies I was telling,</font>

896
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:31,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.</font>

897
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:33,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a chance you might
be in the wrong business.</font>

898
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:40,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe you.</font>

899
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:42,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

900
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:45,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it was the other way around,</font>

901
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:48,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it was down to me
to save your life,</font>

902
01:10:48,024 --> 01:10:50,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">now you be honest with me,</font>

903
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you trust me to do it?</font>

904
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would now.</font>

905
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:02,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm always honest.</font>

906
01:11:02,838 --> 01:11:04,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you seem pretty chipper</font>

907
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">for someone who just found
out they died for nothing.</font>

908
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, guess I just like
to know who I'm fighting.</font>

909
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:12,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made breakfast.</font>

910
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:16,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you guys eat
that sort of thing.</font>

911
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the question is,</font>

912
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?</font>

913
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:24,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pierce.</font>

914
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world.</font>

915
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:28,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's not working alone.</font>

916
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:31,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zola's algorithm was
on the Lemurian Star.</font>

917
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">So was Jasper Sitwell.</font>

918
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people</font>

919
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:43,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?</font>

920
01:11:43,645 --> 01:11:46,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer is, you don't.</font>

921
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.</font>

922
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this Bakhmala?</font>

923
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:55,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Khalid Khandil
mission, that was you?</font>

924
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't say he
was a Pararescue.</font>

925
01:11:59,828 --> 01:12:02,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.</font>

926
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.</font>

927
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:05,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you use?
A stealth chute?</font>

928
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

929
01:12:07,635 --> 01:12:09,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">These.</font>

930
01:12:14,074 --> 01:12:15,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said
you were a pilot.</font>

931
01:12:15,743 --> 01:12:17,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said pilot.</font>

932
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:23,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't ask you to do this, Sam.</font>

933
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:24,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got out for a good reason.</font>

934
01:12:24,953 --> 01:12:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, Captain America
needs my help.</font>

935
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:28,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no better
reason to get back in.</font>

936
01:12:31,993 --> 01:12:33,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?</font>

937
01:12:33,828 --> 01:12:35,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last one is at Fort Meade.</font>

938
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:39,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.</font>

939
01:12:41,668 --> 01:12:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't be a problem.</font>

940
01:12:44,271 --> 01:12:46,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I got to
fly home tonight</font>

941
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I got some
constituency problem</font>

942
01:12:49,243 --> 01:12:51,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got to press the flesh.</font>

943
01:12:51,345 --> 01:12:54,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any constituent in particular, Mr.
Senator?</font>

944
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not really.</font>

945
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:59,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty-three, kind of hot.</font>

946
01:12:59,086 --> 01:13:00,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real hot, you know?</font>

947
01:13:00,487 --> 01:13:02,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.</font>

948
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:03,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who listens at that point?</font>

949
01:13:03,923 --> 01:13:05,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't sound like much
of a problem to me.</font>

950
01:13:05,725 --> 01:13:08,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Because she's
killing my back.</font>

951
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:10,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this isn't the place
to talk about it.</font>

952
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a nice pin.</font>

953
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Come here.</font>

954
01:13:16,036 --> 01:13:17,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hail HYDRA:</font>

955
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,980

- Yeah, I just saw that.</font>

956
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:25,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.</font>

957
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a minute.</font>

958
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the car around.</font>

959
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir?</font>

966
01:13:58,877 --> 01:14:00,744

<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I are gonna take a ride.</font>

970
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why would I do that?</font>

971
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that tie looks
really expensive,</font>

972
01:14:12,358 --> 01:14:14,868

974

01:25:03,828 --> 01:25:06,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of that's
your fault, Steve.</font>

nothing, I had Bucky.</font>

1051
01:25:44,668 --> 01:25:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three holes. Start digging.</font>

1052
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">GSW. She's lost at least a pint.</font>

1053
01:26:15,731 --> 01:26:17,233

Why not just tell us?</font>

1085
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:41,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was he?</font>

1086
01:28:41,842 --> 01:28:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You met him earlier this
week on another assignment.</font>

1087
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:49,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew him.</font>

1088
01:28:57,224 --> 01:29:00,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your work has been
a gift to mankind.</font>

1089
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shaped the century.</font>

1090
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:07,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I need you to do
it one more time.</font>

1091
01:29:07,935 --> 01:29:11,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.</font>

1092
01:29:11,771 --> 01:29:15,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tomorrow morning, we're
gonna give it a push.</font>

1093
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:19,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, if you don't do your
part, I can't do mine.</font>

1094
01:29:20,613 --> 01:29:23,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.</font>

1095
01:29:26,453 --> 01:29:28,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I knew him.</font>

1096
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prep him.</font>

1097
01:29:36,295 --> 01:29:39,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been out of cryo
freeze too long.</font>

1098
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then wipe him and start over.</font>

1099
01:30:22,707 --> 01:30:26,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man declined the
Nobel Peace Prize.</font>

1100
01:30:27,078 --> 01:30:30,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said peace wasn't
an achievement,</font>

1101
01:30:30,748 --> 01:30:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was a responsibility.</font>

1102
01:30:33,818 --> 01:30:37,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.</font>

1103
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:39,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to stop the launch.</font>

1104
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:43,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.</font>

1105
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

1106
01:30:46,765 --> 01:30:49,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once the helicarriers
reach 3,000 feet,</font>

1107
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:53,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponized.</font>

1108
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:55,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to breach those carriers</font>

1109
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:58,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">and replace their targeting
blades with our own.</font>

1110
01:30:58,143 --> 01:30:59,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">One or two won't cut it.</font>

1111
01:30:59,377 --> 01:31:02,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,</font>

1112
01:31:02,012 --> 01:31:05,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if even one of those
ships remains operational,</font>

1113
01:31:05,649 --> 01:31:07,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">a whole lot of people
are gonna die.</font>

1114
01:31:07,652 --> 01:31:11,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA:</font>

1115
01:31:11,088 --> 01:31:13,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.</font>

1116
01:31:13,457 --> 01:31:16,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe, just maybe we
can salvage what's left...</font>

1117
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:17,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not salvaging anything.</font>

1118
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not just taking
down the carriers, Nick.</font>

1119
01:31:19,395 --> 01:31:20,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

1120
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing
to do with this.</font>

1121
01:31:21,931 --> 01:31:24,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.</font>

1122
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:26,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.</font>

1123
01:31:26,703 --> 01:31:28,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">HYDRA grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed.</font>

1124
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.</font>

1125
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:34,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many paid the
price before you did?</font>

1126
01:31:36,646 --> 01:31:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I didn't
know about Barnes.</font>

1127
01:31:38,614 --> 01:31:40,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if you had, would
you have told me?</font>

1128
01:31:40,684 --> 01:31:43,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?</font>

1129
01:31:43,654 --> 01:31:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA:</font>

1130
01:31:46,657 --> 01:31:48,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">it all goes.</font>

1131
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.</font>

1132
01:31:55,565 --> 01:31:56,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me.</font>

1133
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:59,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do what he does, just slower.</font>

1134
01:32:02,405 --> 01:32:04,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

1135
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:13,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.</font>

1136
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:26,268
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We looked for you, after.</i></font>

1137
01:32:27,095 --> 01:32:29,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i></font>

1138
01:32:29,332 --> 01:32:33,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I'm sorry. I just
kind of wanted to be alone.</font>

1139
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was it?</font>

1140
01:32:35,805 --> 01:32:37,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was okay.</font>

1141
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:40,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's next to Dad.</font>

1142
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna ask...</font>

1143
01:32:42,811 --> 01:32:44,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...</font>

1144
01:32:45,581 --> 01:32:47,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can put the couch
cushions on the floor</font>

1145
01:32:47,216 --> 01:32:49,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">like when we were kids.</font>

1146
01:32:49,484 --> 01:32:52,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be fun. All you got
to do is shine my shoes,</font>

1147
01:32:52,387 --> 01:32:54,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe take out the trash.</font>

1148
01:32:59,027 --> 01:33:01,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1149
01:33:03,564 --> 01:33:07,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Buck, but I
can get by on my own.</font>

1150
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:12,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing is, you don't have to.</font>

1151
01:33:14,775 --> 01:33:16,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm with you to the
end of the line, pal.</font>

1153
01:33:21,182 --> 01:33:22,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1154
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:27,029

be and the guy he is now,</font>

1162
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna wear that?</font>

1163
01:33:48,943 --> 01:33:52,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. If you're gonna fight a
war, you got to wear a uniform.</font>

01:34:42,662 --> 01:34:45,197
