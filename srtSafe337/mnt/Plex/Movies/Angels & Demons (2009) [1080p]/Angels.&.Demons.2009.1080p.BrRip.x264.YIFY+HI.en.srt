<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.</font>

152
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drove them underground</font>

153
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">into a secret society.</font>

154
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Langdon.
- Yes?</font>

155
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Vatican City.</font>

156
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector
General of the Vatican Police Force.</font>

157
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:20,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pleasure.</font>

158
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:21,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way please.</font>

159
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.</font>

160
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.</font>

161
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls</font>

162
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the exception of the
security of His Holiness...</font>

163
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- ... and the Apostolic Palace.</font>

164
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is Swiss Guard.</font>

165
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I}The Roman Carabinieri are here as
well in an advisory capacity.</font>

166
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">So jurisdictionally this is...</font>

167
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:45,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">A goddamn nightmare.</font>

168
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?</font>

169
00:15:56,412 --> 00:16:02,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">1857. Pope Pius IX felt the
male form would inspire lust.</font>

170
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-manned' hundreds of these statues.</font>

171
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plaster fig leaves were added later.</font>

172
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?</font>

173
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm anti-vandalism.</font>

174
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I urge you to guard your tone here.</font>

175
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Swiss Guard is a
calling, not a profession,</font>

176
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it encourages a certain civiltry.</font>

177
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Richter, the head of the
Guard, is a deeply spiritual man.</font>

178
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was close to the
late Pope. Understood?</font>

179
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't study symbols because
I consider them unimportant.</font>

180
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:46,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ceremony, traditions,
heavily mark our lives.</font>

181
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope I can help.
- So do I.</font>

182
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were my idea.</font>

183
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait here. Please.</font>

184
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander? Commander Richter?</font>

185
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctor Vetra?</font>

186
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Commander Richter, principal of
the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming.</font>

187
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Professor Langdon.</font>

188
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a relief.
The symbologist is here.</font>

189
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, please, Miss Vetra.</font>

190
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">The situation has changed.</font>

191
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">We received another
threat from the kidnapper.</font>

192
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The canister was stolen from
my lab around noon yesterday.</font>

193
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Paintivolio</font>

194
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:50,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">and mutilated him in
order to bypass security.</font>

195
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We use retinal scanners.</font>

196
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cut out his eye.</font>

197
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?</font>

198
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.</font>

199
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">It, too, was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican walls.</font>

200
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance called antimatter.</font>

201
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:11,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to locate it immediately.
We evacuate Vatican City.</font>

202
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:13,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite familiar with
incendiaries, Miss Vetra.</font>

203
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never heard of
antimatter being used as such.</font>

204
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, its never been generated
in significant quantities before.</font>

205
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:22,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a way of studying the
origins of the universe.</font>

206
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">To try to isolate what some
people call "the God Particle".</font>

207
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are implications
for energy, research-</font>

208
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:28,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">"God Particle"?</font>

209
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you call it isn't important.</font>

210
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.</font>

211
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:40,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.</font>

212
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">The antimatter is suspended there...</font>

213
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">in an airtight nano-composite shell
with electromagnets on each end.</font>

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it were to
fall out of suspension,</font>

215
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">and come into contact with matter,
say with the bottom of the canister,</font>

216
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:53,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.</font>

217
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">What might cause it to
fall out of suspension?</font>

218
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battery going dead.</font>

219
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which it will just before midnight.</font>

220
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of annihilation? How violent?</font>

221
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cataclysmic event.</font>

222
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blinding explosion
equivalent to about 5 kilotons.</font>

223
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican City will be consumed by light.</font>

224
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the exact
words the kidnapper used.</font>

225
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will destroy your four pillars.</font>

226
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will brand your Preferiti and
sacrifice them on the altars of science.</font>

227
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then bring your church down upon you.</font>

228
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican City will be consumed by light.</font>

229
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.</font>

230
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.</font>

231
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four pillars. There's
your kidnapped cardinals.</font>

232
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.</font>

233
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Play it again.</font>

234
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will destroy your four pillars.</font>

235
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will brand your Preferiti...</font>

236
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, stop it. Stop.</font>

237
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brand them?</font>

238
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's another Illuminati legend.</font>

239
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one says that there
are a set of five 'Brands'.</font>

240
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one an ambigram.</font>

241
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first four are the
fundamental elements of science:</font>

242
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">earth, air, fire and water.</font>

243
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Th fifth is a mystery.</font>

244
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's this.</font>

245
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said they'd be killed publicly.</font>

246
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.</font>

247
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">La Purga?</font>

248
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez, you guys don't even
read your own history, do you?</font>

249
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">1668. The church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists</font>

250
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">and branded each one of them on the
chest with the symbol of the cross.</font>

251
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">To 'purge' them of their
sins and they executed them,</font>

252
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">threw their bodies out in the street</font>

253
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a warning to others
to stop questioning</font>

254
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">church rulings on scientific
matters. They radicalized them.</font>

255
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati.</font>

256
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">One bent on... on retribution.</font>

257
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And look how they intend to
finally get it. Using anti-matter.</font>

258
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.</font>

259
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any more?</font>

260
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sacrifice them
on the altars of science.</font>

261
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then bring your church down upon you.</font>

262
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican City will be consumed by light.</font>

of the Path of Illumination.</font>

264
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Path of Illumination?</font>

265
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need access to the Vatican archives.</font>

266
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, I don't think this
is the appropriate moment-</font>

267
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your petition has been
denied seven times.</font>

268
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. This has-
This has nothing to do with my work.</font>

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Path of Illumination
is a hidden trail through Rome itself</font>

270
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">that leads to the
Church of the Illumination.</font>

271
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.</font>

272
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path,</font>

273
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">the four churches along it.</font>

274
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may be where he intends
to murder your Cardinals.</font>

275
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.</font>

276
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we could figure out the first
church and get there before he does,</font>

277
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe we could stop it.</font>

278
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't find the start of the
path until I get into the archives.</font>

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if I wanted to help you,</font>

280
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">access to the archives
is only by written decree</font>

281
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the curator on the
Board of Vatican Librarians.</font>

282
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or by papal mandate.</font>

283
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but, as you no doubt have
heard, the Holy Father is dead.</font>

284
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about il Camerlengo?</font>

285
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Camerlengo is just a priest
here. The former pope's chamberlain.</font>

286
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?</font>

287
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fellas, you called me.</font>

288
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Holiness once told me</font>

289
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Pope is a man torn between
the real world and the divine.</font>

290
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.</font>

291
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.</font>

292
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Purga is a dark stain
on this church's history.</font>

293
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.</font>

294
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commandante, have you begun a
search for this explosive device?</font>

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, but it could be anywhere.</font>

296
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.</font>

297
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.</font>

298

are in conclave,</font>

299
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,600

are at a minimum.</font>

301
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signore, if you are about to suggest
a naked eye search</font>

302
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,686

I will tell you...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Commander.
- ... I do not have the people.</font>

304
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although I am not His Holiness,</font>

305
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,920

you are addressing this office.</font>

306
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:54,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

307
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Father.
- Good.</font>

308
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.</font>

309
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?</font>

310
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,828

screen goes dark,</font>

311
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,080

idea of the camera's location.</font>

312

and your research partner,</font>

this antimatter project?</font>

314
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one but the research team.</font>

315
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">This project was strictly confidential.</font>

316
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Silvano kept detailed journals.</font>

317
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,600

about what we were doing,</font>

318
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">he would have made a note of it.</font>

319
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,680

320

entanglement with the church,</font>

329
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is a question I'd like to ask you
first, here, in the office of His Holiness.</font>

330
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe in God, Sir?</font>

331
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, I simply
believe that religion...</font>

332
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did not ask you if you
believe what man says about God.</font>

333
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked if you believe in God.</font>

334
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an academic.</font>

335
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mind tells me I will
never understand God.</font>

336
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your heart?</font>

337
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tells me I'm not meant to.</font>

338
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,960

I have yet to receive.</font>

339
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440

the Church of Illumination,</font>

342
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">that may be where they've
hidden the antimatter.</font>

343
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shining star at the end
of the path. I thought so, too.</font>

344
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow the path and we may find
the canister at the end of it.</font>

345
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you deactivate the device?</font>

346
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can change the canister's batteries as long
as we have more than five minutes of life.</font>

347
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would give us another 24
hours to get it safely back to CERN:</font>

or was he mocking you?</font>

350
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Both. You're a physicist?</font>

351
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?</font>

352
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:57,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

353
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your project... it was to give
towards the energy research?</font>

354
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, yes.</font>

355
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">One pack of antimatter could
power an entire city for a month.</font>

356
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.</font>

357
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.</font>

358
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.</font>

359
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who didn't think the church
and science were enemies</font>

360
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">but just a different language
telling the same story.</font>

361
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone of like minds could find
the Church of Illumination.</font>

362
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he couldn't exactly advertise its
location, so he created a coded path.</font>

363
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Richter has started to turn
off the power at various rates.</font>

364
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be back on in a minute.</font>

365
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then some unknown Illuminati
master sculpted four statues.</font>

366
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements:</font>

367
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">earth, air, fire, water.</font>

368
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And placed the statues out in
public, in churches throughout Rome.</font>

369
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.</font>

370
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the end of the path was
the Church of Illumination.</font>

371
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you could find that,
you were one of them.</font>

372
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think he's going to
murder the cardinals in the churches?</font>

373
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati called those four churches
by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza".</font>

374
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sacrifice them on the
altars of science, he said.</font>

375
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

376
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wow. Look at this.</font>

377
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Signori.</font>

378
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cardinal Strauss, have you
been informed of the situation?</font>

379
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

380
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.</font>

381
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">At this late hour?</font>

382
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be highly unorthodox.</font>

383
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, yet, was ensured to wrought
my power in great elective.</font>

384
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cruelest honor in Christendom.</font>

385
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:04,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.</font>

386
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,228

387
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,720

taken at its most vulnerable moment.</font>

388
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:13,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is not a coincidence.</font>

389
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">The church will not fall in a
day. We must evacuate Vatican City.</font>

390
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is exactly what they
want. Publicity and panic.</font>

391
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We must not give them
oxygen for the media fire.</font>

392
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the people in St. Peter's Square?</font>

393
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Care deeply about
their church, as we do.</font>

394
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their faith will sustain them.</font>

395
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their faith will not protect
them from an explosion.</font>

396
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?</font>

397
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.</font>

398
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Patrick, do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold</font>

399
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your true place
here at the Vatican.</font>

400
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were a favorite of His Holiness.</font>

401
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But His Holiness is with his father now.</font>

402
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mea culpa.</font>

403
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seal the doors.</font>

404
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone outside.</font>

405
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, please.</font>

406
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Beautiful.</font>

407
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,680

408
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,920

409

410
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,080

feel light headed at first.</font>

411

414
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must. Now of all times.</font>

415

Sometimes just signed '503'.</font>

00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:40,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">with heaven above, hell below,</font>

441
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">as the church had said it was.</font>

442
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, they forced him to
recant his second book.</font>

443
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:46,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what was this one?</font>

444
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how he got the word out.</font>

445
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the truth. Not what
the Vatican forced him to write.</font>

446
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smuggled out of Rome, printed in
Holland on setched papyrus. See?</font>

447
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:56,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way, any scientist
that was caught with a copy</font>

448
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">could just throw it in water and
Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.</font>

449
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between that and Vatican burnings</font>

450
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's possible this is the
only copy that remains.</font>

451
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I'm correct,</font>

452
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">the segno is hidden on page number...</font>

453
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five.</font>

454
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

455
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you need help with the Latin?</font>

456
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

457
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...</font>

458
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a...</font>

459
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:45,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait.</font>

460
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do that again.</font>

461
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

462
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. It's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.</font>

463
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back.</font>

464
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in English.</font>

465
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">English?</font>

466
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why English?</font>

467
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">English wasn't used in the
Vatican. It was too polluted.</font>

468
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's free thinking. It was the language
of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.</font>

469
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:13,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's another one.</font>

470
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The path of light is laid a sacred test.
" Would you write this down as I dictate?</font>

471
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:20,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Professor. No time.</font>

472
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.
Well, what the hell? Yeah.</font>

473
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty minutes till eight.
Where are we headed?</font>

474
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you in a minute.</font>

475
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Let me see that page again.</font>

476
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get that paper?</font>

477
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We borrowed it.</font>

478
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">"From Santi's earthly tomb,
the demon's hole..."</font>

479
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:03,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you insane?</font>

480
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">"... across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."</font>

481
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The path of light is
laid in a sacred test."</font>

482
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."</font>

483
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?</font>

484
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did.</font>

485
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">"From Santi's earthly tomb..."</font>

486
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.</font>

487
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.</font>

488
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.</font>

489
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.</font>

490
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.</font>

491
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just pulled a dozen
of my best men for this.</font>

492
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better be right.</font>

493
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is one of the busiest
spot in all of Rome.</font>

494
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can never get away
with it. It's impossible.</font>

495
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">The poem implies-</font>

496
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">The poem? Unbelievable.</font>

497
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.</font>

498
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb</font>

499
00:38:19,932 --> 00:38:21,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Raphael's tomb is
inside that building.</font>

500
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because the Vatican destroyed all
of the pagan statues in the late 1800s,</font>

501
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">if this is the first marker,</font>

502
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever clues were here to lead
us to the next are sure gone by now.</font>

503
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The path is dead. So, this
is it. Your only chance.</font>

504
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seperate approaches.</font>

505
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">No closer than two blocks and
no uniforms. Three minutes.</font>

506
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need a set of eyes inside.</font>

507
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Two men with symmetric black suits
and earpieces? They're hardly disguised.</font>

508
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.</font>

509
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:53,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have communication.</font>

510
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't carry a walkie talkie.
It's too conspicuous.</font>

511
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tourists have cell phones, don't they?</font>

512
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. You can't send
her in there alone.</font>

513
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I won't.</font>

514
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.</font>

515
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe we're not
getting along today, hmm?</font>

516
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold my hand.</font>

517
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But don't crush it.
- Sorry.</font>

518
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nervous newlywed.</font>

519
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.</font>

520
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That could be the
demon's hole in the poem.</font>

521
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are the tombs at an angle?</font>

522
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're facing east to
worship the rising sun.</font>

523
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:43,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this is a Christian church.</font>

524
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays</font>

525
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make conversion less of a shock.</font>

526
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the 25th of December.</font>

527
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun.</font>

528
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">It also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.</font>

529
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.</font>

530
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go to the right and
I'll meet you in 180 degrees.</font>

531
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me, please.</font>

532
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the Pantheon, which
means 'Temple of all Gods',</font>

533
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">was originally built as a temple to
all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC.</font>

534
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although the building is usually
credited to Agrippa of Damascus...</font>

535
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert!</font>

536
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert!</font>

537
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Raphael's tomb,
but it's the wrong one.</font>

538
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:33,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

539
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.</font>

540
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was he originally buried?</font>

541
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Urbino, I think.</font>

542
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Santi's earthly tomb. What could
posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?</font>

543
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must
mean the chapel that he built.</font>

544
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not buried in it. He designed it.</font>

545
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.</font>

546
00:40:58,452 --> 00:40:59,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are there any questions?</font>

547
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes!</font>

548
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary anex</font>

549
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">in an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic church?</font>

550
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I can only think of one.</font>

551
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">One is good.</font>

552
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrong? What do you mean wrong?</font>

553
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Chigi chapel in the
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.</font>

554
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was once called Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.</font>

555
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:26,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earth. The first element. That's it.</font>

556
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.</font>

557
00:41:28,772 --> 00:41:31,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the Vatican.</font>

558
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the Vatican?
You-You can't.</font>

559
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commandante, if you care at all about
your church, you'll listen to me.</font>

560
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">My church?</font>

561
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">My church comforts the sick and dying.</font>

562
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?</font>

563
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. You don't have one.</font>

564
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640

565
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, this makes sense.
Look, look, look!</font>

566
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right in front of the church.</font>

567
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:10,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.</font>

573
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be in one of these areas.</font>

575

<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.</font>

576
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Demon's Hole.</font>

577
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.</font>

578
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your flashlight.</font>

579
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,520

Preferiti to be rescued.</font>

586
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we should, as well, yes?</font>

587
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until the smoke is white</font>

588
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,060

have chosen a new Holy Father.</font>

589
00:47:41,112 --> 00:47:45,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now the Vatican seat of
ultimate power remains vacant.</font>

590
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the body out of there.
Search the rest of the building.</font>

591
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chartrand!
- Sir.</font>

592
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outside a perimeter.
Secure, but invisible.</font>

593
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:00,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">No lights, no guns.
Nobody knows. Understand?</font>

594
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:01,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

595
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it Raphael?</font>

596
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chapel is Raphael.</font>

597
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the sculptures are Bernini.</font>

598
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">The unknown Illuminati master?</font>

599
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bernini?</font>

600
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.</font>

601
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Illuminati were infiltrators.</font>

602
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">There wasn't a powerful organization
on earth they didn't penetrate,</font>

603
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:35,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">including the Vatican,
by hiding in plain sight.</font>

the annihilation of the earth.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."</font>

607
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first marker.</font>

608
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The path is a line.</font>

609
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Southwest.</font>

610
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was pointing southwest.</font>

611
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earth, air, fire, water.</font>

612
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.</font>

613
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second church is
somewhere southwest of here.</font>

614
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure this time?</font>

615
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.</font>

616
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use it now.</font>

617
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.</font>

618
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">But nothing intersects the line until
it hits... until it hits St. Peter's.</font>

619

<font color="#FFFFFF">Michelangelo designed
St. Peter's, not Bernini.</font>

620
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.</font>

621
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second marker must be a
statue in St. Peter's Square.</font>

622
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?</font>

623
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not unless you want the full
attention of the world press.</font>

624
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">No majority in the first vote,</font>

625
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Cardinal Baggia from
Italy is the clear favorite...</font>

626
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:56,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...</font>

627
00:50:56,132 --> 00:51:02,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...</font>

628
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stem cell research is murder!</font>

629
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You condemn sick people to death.</font>

630
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:11,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man is not God.</font>

631
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. Another obelisk.</font>

632
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check the crowd. It's almost
nine. He's got to be here already.</font>

633
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be a hundred statues up there.</font>

634
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.</font>

635
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?</font>

636
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bas relief. Of course.</font>

637
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's still a sculpture.</font>

638
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.</font>

639
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look for another having
something to do with air.</font>

640
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vento Ponente. West wind.</font>

641
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vittoria.</font>

642
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is.</font>

643
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">West wind. An angel blowing
out five streaks of air.</font>

644
00:52:57,612 --> 00:52:59,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it.</font>

645
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call the police!</font>

646
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call an ambulance!</font>

647
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still alive.</font>

648
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">His chest.
They punctured his lungs.</font>

649
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And you squeezed the life
out of a bishop of Rome."</font>

650
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.</font>

651
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.</font>

652
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It impliess the Illuminati murdered
him with his own medication.</font>

653
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

654
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on here.</font>

655
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">"With man's solution
we stilled his heart."</font>

656
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">"With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy vein."</font>

657
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did the Holy Father take any
kind of medication by injection?</font>

658
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tinzaparin.</font>

659
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had thrombophlebitis.</font>

660
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took an injection every
day, but no one knew that.</font>

661
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone knew it.</font>

662
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he had health concerns
and seizures, as well.</font>

663
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he took steps to make
sure he was watched for safety.</font>

664
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.</font>

665
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.</font>

666
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">An overdose could cause massive
internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.</font>

667
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might look like a stroke at first,</font>

668
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">but in few days,
his body would show signs.</font>

669
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">This could easily be examined.</font>

670
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Vetra, in case
you're not aware of it...</font>

671
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Papal autopsy is
prohibited by Vatican law.</font>

672
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going to defile his Holiness body
just because of these claims.</font>

673
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why would they
send this letter now?</font>

674
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order to cause panic.</font>

675
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The sun will blind at midnight..."</font>

676
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and neither police nor
professors can stop it."</font>

677
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows I'm here.</font>

678
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, they were hoping
this letter would become public.</font>

679
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might be wise to preempt
their next attempt</font>

680
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">by making an announcement of our own.</font>

681
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.</font>

682
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cardinal Strauss has insisted this
entire matter be kept internal.</font>

683
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.</font>

684
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">His final instructions, before
sealing the doors, were very clear.</font>

685
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cardinal Strauss does not
dictate Vatican protocols.</font>

686
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to say, yet, technically,
now that conclave has begun,</font>

687
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:34,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is privilege and duty to
control public announcements.</font>

688
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've drafted a press release
about the incident at the piazza,</font>

689
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.</font>

690
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">For that, the cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.</font>

691
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Richter,
the search for the device?</font>

692
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city</font>

693
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.</font>

694
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long would you need
to evacuate everyone?</font>

695
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I pull all my men from the
search for the bomb, thirty minutes.</font>

696
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Langdon, you have been
right so far about the path.</font>

697
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's now 9:15. How quickly
can you find the next church?</font>

698
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lines of breath on the carving pointed
due east directly away from Vatican City.</font>

699
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.</font>

700
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.</font>

701
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the Bernini sculpture must
be inside one of them that does.</font>

702
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm willing to get back
into the archives to find it.</font>

703
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.</font>

704
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silvano's journals.
The killer's name could be in here.</font>

705
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.</font>

706
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

707
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you?</font>

708
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would surprise the hell out of me.</font>

709
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.</font>

710
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tourist from Düsseldorf,
whose death is confirmed.</font>

711
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican police have
arrested a suspect...</font>

712
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">The investigation is completed.</font>

713
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's
again, with strict security measures.</font>

714
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vatican did admit that, where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.</font>

715
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trying now to get the
name of the tourist who was...</font>

716
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">But wait.</font>

717
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting word now of smoke.</font>

718
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.</font>

719
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">The smoke is black.</font>

720
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once again, the Cardinals have
failed to reach consensus,</font>

721
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.</font>

722
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking for now?</font>

723
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?</font>

724
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Artwork. It's valuable.</font>

725
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corporations tend to keep
track of their holdings.</font>

726
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Catholic church is not
a corporation. It's a beacon.</font>

727
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">A source of inspiration for one
billion lost and frightened souls.</font>

728
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.</font>

729
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Olivetti said that I was
not to leave your side this time.</font>

730
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't me. It was her.</font>

731
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power in zone 3 is disabled.</font>

732
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">No response on the screen.</font>

733
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power on zone 3 again
and continue with zone 4.</font>

734
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of signs?</font>

735
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

736
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin,</font>

737
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">what signs would his body bear?</font>

738
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bleeding of the oral mucosa.</font>

739
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">His tongue.</font>

740
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.</font>

741
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even after fourteen days?</font>

742
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wouldn't show up until at
least a week after his death.</font>

743
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was very important to me.</font>

744
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I understand.</font>

745
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you come with me, please?</font>

746
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signore, would you
organize a security team</font>

747
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">to escort Ms. Vetra and
myself down to the crypt?</font>

748
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.</font>

749
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you smoke?</font>

750
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little bit.</font>

751
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better sit down
before you keel over.</font>

752
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.</font>

753
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moved at suggestion of the artist.</font>

754
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?</font>

755
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

756
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Translate all of this for me,
and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.</font>

757
01:03:09,012 --> 01:03:11,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for a reference of fire.</font>

758
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.</font>

759
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">His great golden spear. A point of fire.</font>

760
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then "woman left completely afire."</font>

761
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:32,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.</font>

762
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:35,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, this sculpture was
moved to this church?</font>

763
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they shuting down the system?
They know we're down here.</font>

764
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's no power, there's no oxygen.</font>

765
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.</font>

766
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's disappointing.</font>

767
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are we going?
- To see my father.</font>

768
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

769
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was orphaned when I
was nine years of age.</font>

770
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.</font>

771
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day.</font>

772
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was raised by him and by the Church.</font>

773
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the wisest man I ever met.</font>

774
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained,</font>

775
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was brought up in Italy
so I also wanted to do my military service.</font>

776
01:04:23,612 --> 01:04:25,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to fight.</font>

777
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me, "Learn to fly."</font>

778
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari.
Flew helicopters.</font>

779
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bringing the wounded back to hospitals.</font>

780
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was a great man.
- Your father died.</font>

781
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fourteen days ago.</font>

782
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headquarters, you hear me?</font>

783
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.</font>

784
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Answer, please. Anybody hear me?
- Did you get anything?</font>

785
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. The walls are lead lined.
There's no signal.</font>

786
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

787
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.</font>

788
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:23,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican security is impenetrable.</font>

789
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one from the outside
could've got anywhere near him.</font>

790
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was someone on the inside.
We can trust no one.</font>

791
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">On my screen, no response in zone 7.</font>

792
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:40,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We rechon that the
battery will soon be empty</font>

793
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the device will explode
shortly before midnight.</font>

794
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy Father...</font>

795
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was young, you've told me the
voice in my heart was God's voice.</font>

796
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said I should follow
it no matter how painful.</font>

797
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

798
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, give me strength.</font>

799
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believed.</font>

800
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">God help us.</font>

801
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?</font>

802
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.</font>

803
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think someone just tried to kill me.</font>

804
01:10:53,552 --> 01:10:55,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, I promise you,
we had no idea.</font>

805
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:56,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He knows I'm here?
- Yes.</font>

806
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.</font>

807
01:10:58,692 --> 01:10:59,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but we had no idea</font>

808
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building.</font>

809
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Richter was
extending the search.</font>

810
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:07,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he had known the archives
were on that grid,</font>

811
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">he never would have killed the power.</font>

812
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is the other possibility.</font>

813
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it conceivable the Illuminati...</font>

814
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?</font>

815
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps.</font>

816
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The journals. Where are they?</font>

817
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who took the journals from this desk?</font>

818
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signore, this is unacceptable.</font>

819
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a Camerlengo to enter the
chapel once conclave has begun.</font>

820
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:56,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

821
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been a development.</font>

822
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Holiness Celestine was murdered!</font>

823
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it so inconceivable
that it will happen again?</font>

824
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:18,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signori, please, a moment.
Please. Signori.</font>

825
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our church is at war.</font>

826
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are under attack from an old enemy.</font>

827
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati.</font>

828
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have struck us from within.</font>

829
01:12:33,052 --> 01:12:35,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murdering our Holy Father!</font>

830
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new God 'Science'.</font>

831
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call it retribution.
They think it justified...</font>

832
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the Church's attacks on men of
science in the distant past and it's true.</font>

833
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the days of Galileo, this church has
tried to slow the relentless march of progress.</font>

834
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes with misguided means.</font>

835
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">But science and
religion are not enemies.</font>

836
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are simply some things that
science is just too young to understand.</font>

837
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the Church pleads, "Stop."</font>

838
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Slow down."</font>

839
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Think. Wait."</font>

840
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, for this, they call us backwards.</font>

841
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who is more ignorant?</font>

842
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who cannot define lightning...</font>

843
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?</font>

844
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The battle is well under way, signori.</font>

845
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must defend ourselves.</font>

846
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, what if this time, we fight
their stealth with openness?</font>

847
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Combat their wicked
scheme with simple truth.</font>

848
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">And end this brutish
battle once and for all.</font>

849
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the outside world could
see this church as I do,</font>

850
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking beyond the
ritual of these walls,</font>

851
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">they would see a modern miracle.</font>

852
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">A brotherhood of
imperfect, simple souls...</font>

853
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion</font>

854
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a world spinning out of control.</font>

855
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signori, I ask..</font>

856
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray...</font>

857
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you break this conclave.</font>

858
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the doors,</font>

859
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">evacuate St. Peter's Square</font>

860
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell the world the truth.</font>

861
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him down.</font>

862
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. There, that
chain. On that pulley.</font>

863
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bench. Get this pew off
here and make it a ladder.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">God answers all prayers, but...</font>

867
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes His answer is no.</font>

868
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">The College will not break conclave.</font>

869
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I suggest...
you direct your energies</font>

870
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">to helping the Swiss Guard
find this explosive device.</font>

871
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it exists.</font>

872
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">And leave Church leadership...</font>

873
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">to its leaders.</font>

874
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eminence.</font>

875
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a growing fear</font>

Olivetti on the radio.</font>

It's close enough so the wireless signal</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. It has to be here!</font>

991
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,000

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Let me have the flashlight.</font>

1003
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,240

ask is the Lord's will.</font>

I would not exist, now, would I?</font>

It's a one way portal.</font>

Could it have another meaning?</font>

01:42:42,932 --> 01:42:44,240

less than five minutes...</font>

I'll take her up alone.</font>

1105
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cardinal Strauss?</font>

1106
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:36,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.</font>

1107
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has saved the Church

1108
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Praise God. Praise God.</font>

1109
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is alive.</font>

1110
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sacrificed himself for all of us.</font>

1111
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the worst thing
we thought would happen</font>

1112
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.</font>

1113
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought we could change the world.</font>

1114
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:36,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So naive.
- No, not naive.</font>

1115
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Innocent, maybe.</font>

1116
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not a crime.</font>

1117
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not so sure.</font>

1118
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:48,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back to work.</font>

1119
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change the world.</font>

1120
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.</font>

1121
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Carmelengo's age
shouldn't influence the decision.</font>

1122
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signori, you are no doubt
aware that by Holy Law</font>

1123
01:51:23,272 --> 01:51:26,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">the man is inelligible
for election to the papacy.</font>

1124
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a cardinal.
He's a priest.</font>

1125
01:51:28,372 --> 01:51:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's of insufficient age.</font>

1126
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or maybe there's a way we
could consider the possibility.</font>

1127
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.</font>

1128
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not call a ballot on this matter.</font>

1129
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, signore, you
would not hold a ballot.</font>

1130
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely, you remember? You gave
up your post as Great Elector.</font>

1131
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are singing at St. Peter's Square.</font>

1132
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what happened here
tonight transcends our laws.</font>

1133
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has it? Is it God's will that
we give ourselves over to frenzy?</font>

1134
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Discard the rules of the Church?</font>

1135
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we need not discard them.</font>

1136
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:06,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...</font>

1137
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly.</font>

1138
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. If the Holy Spirit
speaks through us,</font>

1139
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we call a man's name out loud...</font>

1140
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is election by adoration.</font>

1141
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- He's God's choice.</font>

1142
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:26,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy,</font>

1143
01:52:26,292 --> 01:52:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.</font>

1144
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Signor Camerlengo?
- Yes?</font>

1145
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.</font>

1146
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me?
- Yes, Padre.</font>

1147
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1148
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silvano's journals. I want them back.</font>

1149
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Richter said...</font>

1150
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Holiness suffered from seizures</font>

1151
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">and steps were taken...</font>

1152
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">for safety.</font>

1153
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made sure he was watched, he said.</font>

1154
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he were trying
to give me this key?</font>

1155
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:26,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the Papal office.</font>

1156
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Pope was worried about seizures,</font>

1157
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">he must've had Richter install
cameras without telling anyone.</font>

1158
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">To keep an eye on him for his safety.</font>

1159
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it records.</font>

1160
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?</font>

1161
01:54:52,612 --> 01:54:55,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?</font>

1162
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:00,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.</font>

1163
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">As such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work</font>

1164
01:55:05,452 --> 01:55:07,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in need of spiritual guidance.</font>

1165
01:55:07,492 --> 01:55:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Galileo.</font>

1166
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:11,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a month ago,</font>

1167
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">he requested an
audience with the Pope.</font>

1168
01:55:14,252 --> 01:55:15,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know that,</font>

1169
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:18,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">cause you granted the audience and
you were also present during it.</font>

1170
01:55:18,652 --> 01:55:21,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 'God Particle'. To actually
claim an act of creation.</font>

1171
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:26,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.</font>

1172
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">He urged him to go public.</font>

1173
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:31,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">His Holiness thought that
the discovery could actually</font>

1174
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:34,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">scientifically prove the
existence of a divine power.</font>

1175
01:55:34,432 --> 01:55:37,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.</font>

1176
01:55:37,652 --> 01:55:40,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.</font>

1177
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:41,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you...</font>

1178
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw the pope's position
as a softening of church law.</font>

1179
01:55:45,732 --> 01:55:49,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.</font>

1180
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You murdered the Vicar of Christ.</font>

1181
01:55:51,472 --> 01:55:53,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He raised me to
protect this Church,</font>

1182
01:55:53,372 --> 01:55:54,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">even from within.</font>

1183
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:01,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you conjured up an old enemy
from the past. The Illuminati.</font>

1184
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You found the ancient brands
in the papal vaults</font>

1185
01:56:03,852 --> 01:56:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put them to use
to spread fear!</font>

1186
01:56:06,378 --> 01:56:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cardinals are men of belief.</font>

1187
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, their belief
in evil is uniting them.</font>

1188
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.</font>

1189
01:56:15,852 --> 01:56:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no attack.</font>

1190
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to convince the
Cardinals they're in a war,</font>

1191
01:56:21,652 --> 01:56:23,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they will choose a
warrior to lead them.</font>

1192
01:56:23,492 --> 01:56:24,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are at war.</font>

1193
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're weak when we should be strong.</font>

1194
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:30,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If science is allowed to
claim the power of creation,</font>

1195
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is left for God?</font>

1196
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It didn't work, Patrick.</font>

1197
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:38,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It isn't finished.
- Oh yes, it's finished.</font>

1198
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's finished.</font>

1199
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:45,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.</font>

1200
01:56:45,492 --> 01:56:47,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">The moment the doors
to the Conclave open,</font>

1201
01:56:47,938 --> 01:56:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will tell the Cardinals
what you've done.</font>

1202
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was planning on doing this alone.</font>

1203
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down.</font>

1204
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, perhaps,
it's better that you're here.</font>

1205
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down.</font>

1206
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it away.</font>

1207
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:22,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.</font>

1208
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.</font>

1209
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Illuminatus!</font>

1210
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:30,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bastard!</font>

1211
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Padre.</font>

1212
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:49,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?</font>

1213
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:41,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.</font>

1214
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gently.</font>

1215
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But within our walls.</font>

1216
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's on your side.</font>

1217
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:59,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.</font>

1218
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Church sources now confirm that
Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna,</font>

1219
02:01:51,612 --> 02:01:55,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall...</font>

1220
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Catholic church thanks
Camerlengo for his selfless act</font>

1221
02:02:00,932 --> 02:02:03,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">and demands his
immediate canonization.</font>

1222
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vatican has also confirmed
the deaths of three Cardinals</font>

1223
02:02:06,372 --> 02:02:08,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the fire in the
Santa Maria della Vittoria.</font>

1224
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">As we await the appearance of the new
Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy,</font>

1225
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of the four original Preferiti,</font>

1226
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption</font>

1227
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">seems to have been selected</font>

1228
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:22,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">in one of the swiftest and smoothest
conclaves in modern church history.</font>

1229
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon? Please.</font>

1230
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:50,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">A token of thanks from His Holiness</font>

1231
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">and from his new Camerlengo.</font>

1232
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are grateful you saved his life.</font>

1233
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's our understanding
that you require this text</font>

1234
02:03:01,532 --> 02:03:03,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">to complete your scholary work.</font>

1235
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ask only that in your
last grand testament</font>

1236
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">you ensure it finds its way home.</font>

1237
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1238
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you write of us,</font>

1239
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:21,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will write of us,</font>

1240
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">may I ask one thing?</font>

1241
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:26,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do so gently.</font>

1242
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll try.</font>

1243
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Religion is flawed,</font>

1244
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">but only because man is flawed.</font>

1245
02:03:34,972 --> 02:03:37,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">All men, including this one.</font>

1246
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He chose the name Luke.</font>

1247
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been many Marks and Johns.</font>

1248
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never a Luke.</font>

1249
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">It said he was a doctor.</font>

1250
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:09,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.</font>

1251
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is in need of both.</font>

1252
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll counsel him wisely.</font>

1253
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an old man.
I'll counsel him briefly.</font>

1254
