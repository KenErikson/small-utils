150
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:43,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready!</font>

151
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:30,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's ours, Slit!
She's ours.</font>

152
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, we get the Buzzards off her back!</font>

153
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:39,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Form up!</font>

154
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:45,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my head!</font>

155
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up! You can do it!</font>

156
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:28,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morsov!</font>

157
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:32,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Morsov!
- No!</font>

158
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,299

- Witness!</font>

159
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:48,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Witness!
- Witness!</font>

160
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:53,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mediocre, Morsov!
- Mediocre!</font>

161
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back me in!</font>

162
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming!</font>

163
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can't breathe down there!
- Stay out of sight!</font>

164
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:56,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

165
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:10,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back!</font>

166
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's he going?</font>

167
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hydraulics! Hydraulics!</font>

168
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we bring home the booty.</font>

169
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:13,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">She thinks she can lose us, Dad.</font>

170
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">She thinks we're stupid.</font>

171
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:18,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">She thinks she can lose us in there!</font>

172
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fang it! Fang it!</font>

173
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you stop?</font>

174
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crew! Out of the way!
Out of the way!</font>

175
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

176
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:53,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

177
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:18,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.</font>

178
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hunt them down! Hunt them down!</font>

179
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, head! Say bye-bye to the neck!
Decapito!</font>

180
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:01,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going in, Slit!</font>

181
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:07,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! We've almost got her!</font>

182
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Hold it steady!</font>

183
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what a day!
What a lovely day!</font>

184
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the man...</font>

185
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">who grabs the sun...</font>

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">riding to Valhalla!</font>

187
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witness me, Blood Bag!</font>

188
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:25,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witness!</font>

189
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live, I die, I live again!</font>

190
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:36,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not going back.</font>

191
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water.</font>

192
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:02,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

193
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angharad, is that just the wind
or is that a furious vexation?</font>

194
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:53,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it!</font>

195
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:38,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.</font>

196
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna shred her.
Shred her!</font>

197
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:44,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bolt cutters. Chain.</font>

198
00:37:51,148 --> 00:37:52,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look at them.</font>

199
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:55,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">So shiny. So chrome.</font>

200
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna be so grateful.</font>

201
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could ask for anything.</font>

202
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna drive the War Rig.</font>

203
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:05,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.</font>

204
00:38:06,335 --> 00:38:07,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heh, heh. Sure.</font>

205
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:11,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can ask for more than a jacket.
- We're going to the Green Place.</font>

206
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!</font>

207
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.</font>

208
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How does it feel?
- It hurts.</font>

209
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out here, everything hurts.</font>

210
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna get through this?</font>

211
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:01,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do as I say.</font>

212
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now pick up what you can and run.</font>

213
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill switches.</font>

214
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I set the sequence myself.</font>

215
00:39:55,947 --> 00:39:57,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">This Rig goes nowhere without me.</font>

216
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:02,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can get in.</font>

217
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not without them.</font>

218
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we wait.</font>

219
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.</font>

220
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:29,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've damaged one of his Wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?</font>

221
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:40,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.</font>

222
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:43,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.</font>

223
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:53,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want that thing off your face?</font>

224
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

225
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:55,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.</font>

226
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:16,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smeg!</font>

227
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't have to do it just because he
tells you. - What choice does she have?</font>

228
00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:41,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not gonna hurt us.
He needs us.</font>

229
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:44,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why? - To bargain.
- Oh, he'll hurt us alright.</font>

230
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Think he's coming to the Green Place?
- Never!</font>

231
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:49,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a crazy smeg who eats schlanger!</font>

232
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nah, stay out of there.
- Behind you.</font>

233
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:24,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Gas Town Boys.</font>

234
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't damage the goods.</font>

235
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you see?</font>

236
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big Rigs...</font>

237
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:42,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Polecats...</font>

238
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:44,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flamers...</font>

239
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">and there's the People Eater himself.</font>

240
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:52,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming to count the cost.</font>

241
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're dragging something out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.</font>

242
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:13,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

243
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:16,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go.</font>

244
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:41,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filth! You traitored him!</font>

245
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No unnecessary killing!
- This War Boy wants me dead!</font>

246
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We agreed!
- He's kamakrazee!</font>

247
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!</font>

248
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:57,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I live, I die, I live again!</font>

249
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold him!
- Tie him up!</font>

250
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Throw him out!
- Chuck him out!</font>

251
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got more friends.</font>

252
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:10,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullet Farmer.
They're coming from the Bullet Farm.</font>

253
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:14,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over. You can't defy him.</font>

254
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:15,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just watch us, mate!</font>

255
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is the one who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you, War Boy.</font>

256
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a lying old man.</font>

257
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">By his hand we'll be lifted up!</font>

258
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:24,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we have
his logo seared on our backs!</font>

259
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Breeding Stock"!
"Battle Fodder"!</font>

260
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:27,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I am awaited!</font>

261
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:29,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!</font>

262
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing everyone and everything!</font>

263
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not to blame!
- Then who killed the world?</font>

264
00:47:02,043 --> 00:47:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.</font>

265
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:06,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if it's still any good.</font>

266
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.</font>

267
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you here.</font>

268
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:22,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may have to drive the Rig.</font>

269
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:28,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

270
00:47:29,994 --> 00:47:30,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay.</font>

271
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay there.</font>

272
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:38,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you do, you can't be seen.</font>

273
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:42,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.</font>

274
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down here.</font>

275
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:14,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

276
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I call you?</font>

277
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it matter?</font>

278
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:23,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

279
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:27,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I yell "fool", you drive
out of here as fast as you can.</font>

280
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:31,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the sequence:</font>

281
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">One. One, two. One.</font>

282
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Red. Black. Go.</font>

283
00:48:38,664 --> 00:48:39,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have it?</font>

284
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all here!</font>

285
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:10,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">3,000 gallons of gasoline,
just like you asked!</font>

286
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:16,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna unhitch the pod.</font>

287
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You drop the rocks.</font>

288
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:33,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said:
"A few vehicles in pursuit. Maybe."</font>

289
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:36,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">We count three War Parties!</font>

290
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:38,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I got unlucky.</font>

291
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do this!</font>

292
00:51:07,626 --> 00:51:08,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fool!</font>

293
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:50,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's our fuel!</font>

294
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make way for the Ripsaw!</font>

295
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:26,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once I'm over, clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.</font>

296
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:29,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Immortan!
Immortan Joe!</font>

297
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.</font>

298
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! Climb aboard!</font>

299
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:45,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got his boot!
I got the Blood Bag's boot!</font>

300

there's a way inside.</font>

324
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

325
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,532

00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

334
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell him to turn the Rig around!

335
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:20,889

- Did you see it?</font>

336
00:59:22,554 --> 00:59:24,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">She went under the wheels.</font>

337

we're going to the Green Place.</font>

340
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:35,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!</font>

341
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:50,581

- Stop!</font>

344
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:36,291

with that? - We are not things.</font>

350
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:53,876

<font color="#FFFFFF">Green Place?</font>

357
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:31,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a long night's run, heading east.</font>

358
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:37,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need inventory. I want you
to match every gun with its bullets.</font>

- No.</font>

361
01:01:47,231 --> 01:01:48,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to stay together.</font>

362
01:01:49,597 --> 01:01:50,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do it.</font>

363
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:25,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

364
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:29,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saw it.
He saw it all.</font>

365
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">My own Blood Bag
driving the Rig that killed her.</font>

366

<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop doing that.</font>

367
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:47,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

368
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three times the gates were open to me.</font>

369
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:04,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What gates?
- I was awaited in Valhalla.</font>

370
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were calling my name.</font>

371
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:10,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be walking with the Immortan.
Feasting with the heroes of all time.</font>

372
01:03:13,981 --> 01:03:17,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say it was
your manifest destiny not to.</font>

373
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was being spared
for something great.</font>

374
01:03:21,623 --> 01:03:25,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.</font>

375
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.</font>

376

<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are Larry and Barry?</font>

377
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:33,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mates.</font>

378

then the Night Fevers will.</font>

380
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.</font>

381
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:15,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.</font>

382
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:19,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angharad used to call them Antiseed.</font>

383
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:22,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plant one and watch something die.</font>

384
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:36,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out!</font>

385
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, mate.</font>

386
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are down
30,000 units of gasoline...</font>

387
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">19 canisters of nitro,
12 assault bikes...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">7 pursuit vehicles.</font>

389

And now, sir...</font>

390
01:06:09,693 --> 01:06:12,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have us stuck in a quagmire.</font>

391

01:06:32,224 --> 01:06:35,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you coming, brother?
- Wait!</font>

396
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's gone awful quiet in there...
- Get it out.</font>

397
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it out!</font>

398
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:45,773

I've been called to the torture!</font>

399

just beyond that thing.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Retaliate first.</font>

451
01:12:59,425 --> 01:13:00,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

452
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:21,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you hurt?</font>

453
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're bleeding.</font>

454
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:26,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not his blood.</font>

455
01:14:28,434 --> 01:14:29,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

456
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:31,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Mother's Milk.</font>

457
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.
Sleep.</font>

458
01:15:18,001 --> 01:15:19,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some rest.</font>

459
01:15:29,895 --> 01:15:32,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know
this place even exists?</font>

460
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:36,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born there.</font>

461
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So why'd you leave?
- I didn't.</font>

462
01:15:43,235 --> 01:15:45,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was taken as a child.</font>

463
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:48,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stolen.</font>

464
01:15:54,164 --> 01:15:57,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You done this before?
- Many times.</font>

465
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that I drive a War Rig...</font>

466
01:16:02,743 --> 01:16:04,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is the best shot I'll ever have.</font>

467
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">And them?</font>

468
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:10,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're looking for hope.</font>

469
01:16:11,793 --> 01:16:13,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

470
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:19,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Redemption.</font>

471
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:06,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

472
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:20,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember something like that.</font>

473
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:34,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

474
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:39,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

475
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:47,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bait.</font>

476
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay in the Rig.</font>

477
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:58,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry! Please, hurry!
They'll be back!</font>

478
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:02,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am one of the Vuvalini!</font>

479
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of the Many Mothers!</font>

480
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:09,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!</font>

481
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.</font>

482
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:17,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">My clan was Swaddle Dog!</font>

483
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's me.</font>

484
01:19:13,863 --> 01:19:15,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something in the eyes.</font>

485
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:18,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.</font>

486
01:19:23,396 --> 01:19:25,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our Furiosa.</font>

487
01:19:27,738 --> 01:19:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has it been?</font>

488
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven thousand days.
Plus the ones I don't remember.</font>

489
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Furiosa.</font>

490
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to your mother?</font>

491
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died.</font>

492
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the third day.</font>

493
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:55,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- From where did you come?
- The West.</font>

494
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:58,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Citadel. Beyond the mountains.</font>

495
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:04,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men. Who are they?</font>

496
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're reliable.
They helped us get here.</font>

497
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find such creatures?</font>

498
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:28,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So soft.
- This one has all her teeth!</font>

499
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:39,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait for them to see it.</font>

500
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

501
01:20:42,256 --> 01:20:44,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See what?
- Home.</font>

502
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Green Place.</font>

503
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:53,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you came from the West...</font>

504
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">you passed it.</font>

505
01:20:56,841 --> 01:21:01,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">The crows.
The creepy place with all the crows.</font>

506
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:03,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The soil.
- We had to get out.</font>

507
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:05,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We had no water.
- The water was filth.</font>

508
01:21:05,649 --> 01:21:07,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was poisoned. It was sour.</font>

509
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:11,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then the crows came.
We couldn't grow anything.</font>

510
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are the others?
- What others?</font>

511
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:17,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Many Mothers.
- We're the only ones left.</font>

512
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

513
01:22:21,872 --> 01:22:24,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you call a satellite.</font>

514
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:26,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Giddy told us about those.</font>

515
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.</font>

516
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:35,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shows.
Everyone in the old world had a show.</font>

517
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:40,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think there's still
somebody out there?</font>

518
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:44,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sending shows?
- Who knows?</font>

519
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:48,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the Plains of Silence.</font>

520
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:54,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay right where you are, little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty out here.</font>

521
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:56,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You having a baby?</font>

522
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:00,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Warlord Junior.
Gonna be so ugly.</font>

523
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be a girl.</font>

524
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You kill people with that, do you?
- Killed everyone I ever met out here.</font>

525
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.</font>

526
01:23:11,604 --> 01:23:13,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.</font>

527
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:19,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

528
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:27,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a peek.</font>

529
01:23:28,948 --> 01:23:30,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeds.</font>

530
01:23:31,185 --> 01:23:34,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are from home.
Heirlooms. The real thing.</font>

531
01:23:35,703 --> 01:23:38,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I plant one every chance I get.
- Where?</font>

532
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:41,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.</font>

533
01:23:42,762 --> 01:23:46,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So many different kinds.
- Trees, flowers, fruit.</font>

534
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back then, everyone had their fill.</font>

535
01:23:50,337 --> 01:23:52,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.</font>

536
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:09,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I talk to you?</font>

537
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've talked with the others.</font>

538
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:40,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.</font>

539
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:47,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...</font>

540
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:50,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can maybe ride for 160 days.</font>

541
01:24:52,795 --> 01:24:54,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of those bikes is yours.</font>

542
01:24:55,872 --> 01:24:57,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fully loaded.</font>

543
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're more than welcome
to come with us.</font>

544
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make my own way.</font>

545
01:25:15,095 --> 01:25:17,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, hope is a mistake.</font>

546
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:26,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh...</font>

547
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll go insane.</font>

548
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:48,841
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Where are you, Max?</i></font>

549
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,146
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

550
01:25:52,698 --> 01:25:55,712
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Help us. You promised to help us.</i></font>

551
01:26:06,168 --> 01:26:08,569
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i></font>

552
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:41,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

553
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:45,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your way home.</font>

554
01:26:48,514 --> 01:26:49,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go back?</font>

555
01:26:51,731 --> 01:26:53,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back?
- Yeah.</font>

556
01:26:53,872 --> 01:26:55,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you weren't insane anymore.</font>

557
01:26:55,621 --> 01:26:59,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are they saying?
- He wants to go back from where they came.</font>

558
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Citadel.</font>

559
01:27:01,822 --> 01:27:05,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's there to find at the Citadel?
- Green.</font>

560
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And water.</font>

561
01:27:08,043 --> 01:27:11,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water. And a lot of crops.</font>

562
01:27:12,132 --> 01:27:14,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got everything you need.
As long as you're not afraid of heights.</font>

563
01:27:14,675 --> 01:27:17,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where does the water come from?
- He pumps it up from deep in the earth.</font>

564
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calls it Aqua Cola
and claims it all for himself.</font>

565
01:27:20,259 --> 01:27:22,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.</font>

566
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:24,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like him already.</font>

567
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:26,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.</font>

568
01:27:26,726 --> 01:27:27,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

569
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:30,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest we go back
the same way we came.</font>

570
01:27:32,118 --> 01:27:33,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Through the canyon.</font>

571
01:27:34,617 --> 01:27:38,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.</font>

572
01:27:39,099 --> 01:27:42,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.</font>

573
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can decouple
the tanker at the pass.</font>

574
01:27:45,604 --> 01:27:48,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut it off behind us.
Kaboom!</font>

575
01:27:51,427 --> 01:27:53,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how exactly
do we take the Citadel?</font>

576
01:27:54,429 --> 01:27:56,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assuming we're still alive by then.</font>

577
01:27:56,582 --> 01:27:59,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.</font>

578
01:27:59,332 --> 01:28:02,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.</font>

579
01:28:03,814 --> 01:28:05,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll be with Nux.</font>

580
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a War Boy.
He'll be bringing us home.</font>

581
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:10,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bringing back what's stolen,
as he's meant to.</font>

582
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:14,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

583
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:17,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels like hope.</font>

584
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:21,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like this plan.
We can start again.</font>

585
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:24,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like the old days!</font>

586
01:28:25,621 --> 01:28:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

587
01:28:27,646 --> 01:28:29,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a hard day.</font>

588
01:28:29,898 --> 01:28:32,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...</font>

589
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:37,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing but salt.</font>

590
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:42,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...</font>

591
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:45,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">together...</font>

592
01:28:46,836 --> 01:28:48,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">come across some kind of redemption.</font>

593
01:29:19,663 --> 01:29:23,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">War Rig!
That's the War Rig!</font>

594
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:35,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's them.
- Why are they going back?</font>

595
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:38,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do they wish to surrender?</font>

596
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are heading for the canyon.</font>

597
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:44,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going back to the Citadel!</font>

598
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:47,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know it's undefended!</font>

599
01:29:47,411 --> 01:29:48,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bollocks!</font>

600
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:52,484
