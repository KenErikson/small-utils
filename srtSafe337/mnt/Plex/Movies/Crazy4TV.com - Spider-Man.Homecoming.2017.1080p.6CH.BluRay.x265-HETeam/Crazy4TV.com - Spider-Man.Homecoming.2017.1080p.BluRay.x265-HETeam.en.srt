<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are never gonna be the same now.</font>

2
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look at this.</font>

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got aliens.</font>

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.</font>

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.</font>

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.</font>

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Tell you what, though.</font>

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't bad, is it?</font>

9
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Yeah.</font>

10
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kid's got a future.</font>

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well...</font>

12
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll see, I guess.</font>

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, hey!</font>

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't saw through that stuff.</font>

15
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">These alien bastards are tough.</font>

16
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta use the stuff they use.</font>

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See? All right.
- All right.</font>

18
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey!</font>

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad you could join us. Afternoon.</font>

20
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.</font>

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.</font>

22
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a huge deal for us.</font>

23
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,081

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,048

We'll take it from here.</font>

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,502

28
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Qualified personnel.</font>

29
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so...</font>

30
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:26,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.</font>

31
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:29,852

exotic materials that you've collected...</font>

32

33
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, what am...</font>

34
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on.</font>

35
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look...</font>

36
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bought trucks for this job.</font>

37
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought in a whole new crew.</font>

38
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,155

39
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.</font>

40
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.</font>

41
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.</font>

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you say?</font>

43
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right. I overextended myself.</font>

45
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.</font>

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put them down.</font>

47
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:13,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.</font>

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,401

We're supposed to turn this in, right?</font>

58

<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't hauling it.</font>

59
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too bad.</font>

60
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,637

from all that alien junk.</font>

61

<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you what.</font>

62
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's keep it.</font>

63
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world's changing.</font>

64
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time we change, too.</font>

65
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, Mason.</font>

66
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,168

- Who you talking to?</font>

69
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.</font>

70
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

71
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you narrating in that voice?</font>

72
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because it's fun.
- Fun.</font>

73
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why do they call you Happy?</font>

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.</font>

75
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?</font>

76
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a bathroom on it.</font>

77
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">No pilot? That's awesome.</font>

78
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.</font>

79
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your first time on a private plane?</font>

80
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,947

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,865

Should it be making that noise?</font>

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,839

why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.</font>

85
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not roommates. Suit up.</font>

86
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Peter, you got this.</font>

87
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.</font>

88
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the case?
- What case?</font>

89
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I thought that was a closet.</font>

90
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is still my room?
- Go.</font>

91
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My room is way bigger than...
- There.</font>

92
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found the case. I found the case.</font>

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A minor upgrade"?</font>

94
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

95
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put it on.
- What the...</font>

96
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...</font>

97
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.</font>

98
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.</font>

99
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane. Insane.</font>

100
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.</font>

101
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.</font>

102
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?</font>

103
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.</font>

104
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everyone.</font>

105
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">The craziest thing just happened.</font>

106
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...</font>

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.</font>

108
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"</font>

109
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:41,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"</font>

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then... Hey, just a second!</font>

111
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming!</font>

112
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

113
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have thin walls here.</font>

114
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing, a little video diary?</font>

115
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- It's all right.</font>

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.</font>

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.</font>

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. You know what?</font>

119
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?</font>

120
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.</font>

121
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.</font>

122
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.</font>

123
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three, two, one. Hey, May.</font>

124
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...</font>

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.</font>

126
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone was impressed.</font>

127
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.</font>

128
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.</font>

129
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.</font>

130
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.</font>

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a private conversation.</font>

132
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.</font>

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.</font>

134
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?</font>

135
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.</font>

136
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can keep the suit?</font>

137
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we were just talking about it.</font>

138
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.</font>

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.</font>

140
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen his cardiogram.</font>

141
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right?
- Yes.</font>

142
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.</font>

143
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.</font>

144
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.</font>

145
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This it?
- Seventh floor.</font>

146
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?</font>

147
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.</font>

148
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when's our next...
When's our next "retreat," you know?</font>

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.</font>

150
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?</font>

151
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean, we'll call you.</font>

152
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, someone will call you. All right?</font>

153
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- From your team.
- Okay. All right.</font>

154
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.</font>

155
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

156
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna call me.</font>

157
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Penis Parker?</font>

158
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,434
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.</i></font>

159
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,565
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.</i></font>

160
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,350
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do you have a date for homecoming?</i></font>

161
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,645
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.</i></font>

162
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i></font>

163
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it. You, in my office right now.</font>

164
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Join me, and together...</font>

165
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.</font>

166
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- So lame.</font>

167
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awesome. How many pieces?</font>

168
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three thousand eight hundred and three.</font>

169
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?</font>

170
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...</font>

171
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.</font>

172
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always got that internship.</font>

173
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.</font>

174
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That would be so sweet.
- Right?</font>

175
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.</font>

176
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a gold coin."</font>

177
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.</font>

178
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.</font>

179
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.</font>

180
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.</font>

181
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'd be great.</font>

182
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna be late.</font>

183
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...</font>

184
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">between points A and B?</font>

185
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flash.</font>

186
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.</font>

187
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. Peter. You still with us?</font>

188
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

189
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.</font>

190
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.</font>

191
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're dead.</font>

192
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...</font>

193
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...</font>

194
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.</font>

195
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Liz get a new top?</font>

196
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.</font>

197
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!</font>

198
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.</font>

199
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too late.</font>

200
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are losers.</font>

201
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then why do you sit with us?</font>

202
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't have any friends.</font>

203
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next question.</font>

204
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?</font>

205
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hydrogen's the lightest.</font>

206
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not the question. Okay.</font>

207
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Uranium.</font>

208
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct. Thank you, Abraham.</font>

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.</font>

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, it's nationals.</font>

211
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?</font>

212
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.</font>

213
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.</font>

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. What's happening?</font>

215
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.</font>

216
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, no.
- Why not?</font>

217
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Right before nationals?</font>

218
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.</font>

219
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.</font>

220
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flash, you're in for Peter.</font>

221
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.</font>

222
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.</font>

223
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is false.</font>

224
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:20,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?</font>

225
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.</font>

226
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:41,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Mr. Delmar?</font>

227
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mr. Parker.</font>

228
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Number five, right?</font>

229
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.</font>

230
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it, boss.</font>

231
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your aunt?</font>

232
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she's all right.</font>

233
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a very hot Italian woman.</font>

234
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your daughter?</font>

235
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.</font>

236
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.</font>

237
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's 5 dollars.</font>

238
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Murph?</font>

239
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, buddy?</font>

240
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how's school?</font>

241
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's boring. Got better things to do.</font>

242
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.</font>

243
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.</font>

244
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally.</font>

245
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?</font>

246
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

247
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?</font>

248
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.</font>

249
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?</font>

250
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody good?</font>

251
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:09,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

252
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?</font>

253
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me Spider-Man.</font>

254
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.</font>

255
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:20,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Not bad.</font>

256
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy.</font>

257
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!</font>

258
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Shut that off!</font>

259
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was...</font>

260
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!</font>

261
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?</font>

262
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!</font>

263
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:53,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.</font>

264
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Gary. How you doing?</font>

265
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marjorie, how are you? How's your mother?</font>

266
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm good, I'm good.</font>

267
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,373
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You have reached the voicemail box of:</i></font>

268
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,003
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Happy Hogan.</i></font>

269
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.</font>

270
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped a grand theft bicycle.</font>

271
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.</font>

272
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.</font>

273
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was really nice and bought me a churro.</font>

274
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:27,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just feel like I could be doing more.</font>

275
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:30,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.</font>

276
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yeah, just call me back.</font>

277
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Peter. Parker.</font>

278
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I tell him about the churro?</font>

279
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey.</font>

280
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

281
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.</font>

282
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.</font>

283
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.</font>

284
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, nice.</font>

285
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can hit, like, five more places tonight.</font>

286
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, guys? You forget your PIN number?</font>

287
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:31,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Avengers.</font>

288
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing here?</font>

289
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.</font>

290
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.</font>

291
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.</font>

292
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey...</font>

293

299
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,044

308
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:59,205

These guys were robbing an ATM...</font>

you're responsible, okay?</font>

321

- Feel free not to.</font>

325
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing. Nothing.</font>

326
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,200

335

340
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, basically.</font>

341
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.</font>

- You know what she's like.</font>

343

every night, she won't let me do this.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Ned, please.</font>

345
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay, okay.</font>

346
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.</font>

347
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.</font>

348
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.</font>

349
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I... Please.</font>

350
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?</font>

351
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,888

- Yeah.</font>

353
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,184

354
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I try the suit on?
- No.</font>

355
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?</font>

356
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.</font>

357
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, wait, then.</font>

358
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:14,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you do this and the Stark internship?</font>

359
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Stark internship.</font>

360
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get out of here.</font>

361

364
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not larby enough.</font>

365

before you talk to me?</font>

366

367
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.</font>

368
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,268

370
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,523

not a fan of that Tony Stark.</font>

371

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man.</font>

438
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

439
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.</font>

440
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.</font>

441
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, what if he's seriously burned?</font>

442
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.</font>

443
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter knows Spider-Man.</font>

444
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't. No. I... I mean...</font>

445
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're friends.</font>

446
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.</font>

447
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've met him, yeah. A couple times.</font>

448
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's...</font>

449
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">through the Stark internship.</font>

450
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.</font>

451
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?</font>

452
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:30,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?</font>

453
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.</font>

454
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.</font>

455
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.</font>

456
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

457
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...</font>

458
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?</font>

459
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

460
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helping you out.</font>

461
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you not hear her?</font>

462
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liz has a crush on you.</font>

463
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you're an Avenger.</font>

464
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.</font>

465
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">House party in the suburbs.</font>

466
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.</font>

467
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a night to remember.</font>

468
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.</font>

469
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it gives me confidence.</font>

470
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a mistake.</font>

471
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, let's just go home.</font>

472
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Peter.</font>

473
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I know it's really hard...</font>

474
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:36,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.</font>

475
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's flowering now.</font>

476
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's so stressed out lately.</font>

477
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:43,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">What helps with stress is a party.</font>

478
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.</font>

479
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter.</font>

480
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.</font>

481
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, May.</font>

482
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you have the suit, right?</font>

483
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.</font>

484
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie, over here!
- Hey.</font>

485
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

486
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,344
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>DJ Flash.</i></font>

487
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in...</font>

488
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:21,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.</font>

489
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't believe you're at this lame party.</font>

490
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're here too.</font>

491
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I?</font>

492
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh.</font>

493
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:33,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.</font>

494
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:35,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.</font>

495
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so happy you guys came.</font>

496
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.</font>

497
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What a great party.
- Thanks.</font>

498
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I...</font>

499
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...</font>

500
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Have fun.</font>

501
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

502
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, what are you doing?</font>

503
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's here. Spider it up.</font>

504
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.</font>

505
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?</font>

506
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm just gonna be myself.</font>

507
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, no one wants that.</font>

508
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude.</font>

509
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Penis Parker, what's up?</font>

510
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where's your pal Spider-Man?</font>

511
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?</font>

512
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:24,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.</font>

513
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.</font>

514
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.</font>

515
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?</font>

516
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be around..."</font>

517
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:49,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, this is stupid. What am I doing?</font>

518
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

519
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">This sucks.</font>

520
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.</font>

521
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. You try.</font>

522
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?</font>

523
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?</font>

524
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.</font>

525
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...</font>

526
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:51,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.</font>

527
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.</font>

528
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.</font>

529
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.</font>

530
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got antigrav climbers.</font>

531
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, climbers?</font>

532
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, what the hell is that?</font>

533
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.</font>

534
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.</font>

535
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

536
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

537
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.</font>

538
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:57,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you just do it again?</font>

539
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.</font>

540
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toomes's phone.</font>

541
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boss.</font>

542
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my butt!</font>

543
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:37,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.</font>

544
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.</font>

545
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, buddy.</font>

546
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.</font>

547
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is more like it.</font>

548
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smells really good.</font>

549
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great movie!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, where are you?</font>

554
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hat's not working. This is not cool.</font>

555
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost got you.</font>

556
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you got away from me, didn't you?</font>

557
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you right where I want you.</font>

558
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise!</font>

559
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

560
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey.</font>

561
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...</font>

562
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.</font>

563
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?</font>

564
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put everything in your suit.</font>

565
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:01,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Including this heater.</font>

566
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's better. Thanks.</font>

567
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you thinking?</font>

568
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.</font>

569
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him down now, huh?</font>

570
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.</font>

571
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.</font>

572

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here.</font>

573
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had that. I was fine.</font>

574
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:27,284
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, I'm not here.</i></font>

575
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...</font>

576
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,909

Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.</font>

Totally uncool of that guy.</font>

663
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.</font>

664
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,077

<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

673
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,567

680
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.</font>

681

<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

682
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.

683
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. I gotta follow them.</font>

684
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,181

that dropped me in the lake.</font>

685
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.</font>

686
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.</font>

688
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:18,065

692
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?</font>

693
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's saying there was an energy pulse here.</font>

01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not trying to ruin your life.</font>

1301
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:17,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know.</font>

1302
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just...</font>

1303
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.</font>

1304
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">And take a shower. You smell.</font>

1305
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You smell like garbage.</font>

1306
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1307
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...</font>

1308
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?</font>

1309
01:23:40,806 --> 01:23:42,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1310
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, get out of here.</font>

1311
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you expelled?</font>

1312
01:23:53,444 --> 01:23:56,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?</font>

1313
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:59,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.</font>

1314
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:02,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so lucky.</font>

1315
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:52,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1316
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.</font>

1317
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:58,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.</font>

1318
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look, I...</font>

1319
01:25:00,886 --> 01:25:03,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.</font>

1320
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine.</font>

1321
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:09,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.</font>

1322
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm...</font>

1323
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just mean that...</font>

1324
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was not cool, especially...</font>

1325
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">because...</font>

1326
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:23,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you.</font>

1327
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1328
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

1329
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're terrible at keeping secrets.</font>

1330
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you'd be surprised.</font>

1331
01:25:37,381 --> 01:25:39,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to get to class, but...</font>

1332
01:25:40,092 --> 01:25:44,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...</font>

1333
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:47,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">forever, but...</font>

1334
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.</font>

1335
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...</font>

1336
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to...</font>

1337
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">go with me?</font>

1338
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Sure.</font>

1339
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? I mean, great. Cool.</font>

1340
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

1341
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm actually going that way.</font>

1342
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">May, I need your help.</font>

1343
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Through or around?</font>

1344
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

1345
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's game day. So, what's the plan?</font>

1346
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door for her.</font>

1347
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.</font>

1348
01:27:04,051 --> 01:27:05,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't be creepy.
- No.</font>

1349
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:07,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.</font>

1350
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this.</font>

1351
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Love you.
- Bye.</font>

1352
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Peter.</font>

1353
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:31,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1354
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Liz's dad.</font>

1355
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put her there.</font>

1356
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell of a grip.</font>

1357
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in here. Come on.</font>

1358
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Peter.</font>

1359
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look very handsome.</font>

1360
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:08,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1361
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got his name right?</font>

1362
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Freddie?
- Peter.</font>

1363
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter. Peter.</font>

1364
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go get Liz.</font>

1365
01:28:16,248 --> 01:28:17,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1366
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:24,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, Pete?</font>

1367
01:28:25,132 --> 01:28:26,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1368
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you look pale.</font>

1369
01:28:30,846 --> 01:28:32,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want something to drink?</font>

1370
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?</font>

1371
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not old enough to drink.</font>

1372
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the right answer.</font>

1373
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.</font>

1374
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't she, Pete?</font>

1375
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you look really good.</font>

1376
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once again, that's the right answer.</font>

1377
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:54,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a corsage?</font>

1378
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

1379
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.</font>

1380
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.</font>

1381
01:29:04,213 --> 01:29:06,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.</font>

1382
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Come on, you guys.</font>

1383
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, closer.</font>

1384
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smile.</font>

1385
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

1386
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:25,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.</font>

1387
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.</font>

1388
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.</font>

1389
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:31,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Promise.</font>

1390
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:32,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's cute.</font>

1391
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.</font>

1392
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Pedro.</font>

1393
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.</font>

1394
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?</font>

1395
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:56,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?</font>

1396
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.</font>

1397
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just saying, you know.</font>

1398
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:03,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you guys who go to that school...</font>

1399
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?</font>

1400
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:09,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.</font>

1401
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:12,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.</font>

1402
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Stark?</font>

1403
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">So cool.</font>

1404
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you do?</font>

1405
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.</font>

1406
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:25,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...</font>

1407
01:30:26,128 --> 01:30:27,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">boring.</font>

1408
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:30,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.</font>

1409
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Spider-Man?</font>

1410
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he like?</font>

1411
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's nice.</font>

1412
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice man.</font>

1413
01:30:40,225 --> 01:30:42,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Solid dude.</font>

1414
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. So cute.</font>

1415
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you around, right? I mean...</font>

1416
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">somewhere. We've... Have we ever...
Because even the voice...</font>

1417
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:01,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">He does Academic Decathlon with me.</font>

1418
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was at my party.</font>

1419
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a great party, really great, yeah.</font>

1420
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:10,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.</font>

1421
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was... I was there longer
than two seconds.</font>

1422
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:18,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.</font>

1423
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:22,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.</font>

1424
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.</font>

1425
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you scared?</font>

1426
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...</font>

1427
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">showed up in the elevator though, huh?</font>

1428
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.</font>

1429
01:31:45,457 --> 01:31:47,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it all from the ground.</font>

1430
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1431
01:31:49,878 --> 01:31:52,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very lucky that he was there that day.</font>

1432
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good old Spider-Man.</font>

1433
01:32:01,515 --> 01:32:03,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, the light.</font>

1434
01:32:18,824 --> 01:32:21,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are. End of the line.</font>

1435
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Dad.</font>

1436
01:32:23,078 --> 01:32:24,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">You head in there, gumdrop.</font>

1437
01:32:24,788 --> 01:32:27,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.</font>

1438
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:31,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let him intimidate you.</font>

1439
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love you.</font>

1440
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.</font>

1441
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

1442
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:40,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys look so pretty.</font>

1443
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know?</font>

1444
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what?</font>

1445
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:50,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she doesn't. Good.</font>

1446
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close to the vest.</font>

1447
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admire that.</font>

1448
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,685

I didn't want my daughter to date...</font>

1450
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter...</font>

1451
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">nothing is more important than family.</font>

1452
01:33:06,288 --> 01:33:08,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved my daughter's life.</font>

1453
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:10,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could never forget something like that.</font>

1454
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm gonna give you one chance.</font>

1455
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready?</font>

1456
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...</font>

1457

1460
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you...</font>

1461
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,810

1462
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you dead.</font>

1463
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:35,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?</font>

01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1465
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,945

my daughter a good time, okay?</font>

1469
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,746

1471
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say to you?</font>

1472
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta go.</font>

1473
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,564

the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.</font>

on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.</font>

01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?</font>

1517
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.</font>

1518
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.</font>

1519
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:19,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.</font>

1520
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounded like he was catching a flight.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.</i></font>

1522
01:38:22,896 --> 01:38:24,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.</font>

1523
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:26,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boxes? It's moving day.</font>

1524
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.</font>

1525
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta stop him!</font>

1526
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:35,737

You're getting close. It's on your right.</font>

1532

1541
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprised?</font>

1542
01:40:01,828 --> 01:40:03,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hey, Pete.</font>

1543
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:05,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't hear you come in.</font>

1544
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over. I've got you.</font>

1545
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...</font>

1546
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:13,626

01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:16,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see why Liz likes you.</font>

1548
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:20,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. When you first came to the house...</font>

1549
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.</font>

1550
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do this to her?</font>

1551
01:40:26,561 --> 01:40:28,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">To her? I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.</font>

1552

your buddy Stark paid for that tower?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Or any of his little toys?</font>

1560
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,827

We have to eat their table scraps.</font>

1571
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I want you to understand.</font>

1572

1575
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,467

That thing hasn't even touched me yet.</font>

1687
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta talk to the kid.</font>

1688
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be close behind.</font>

1689
01:58:42,823 --> 01:58:46,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.</font>

1690
01:58:51,582 --> 01:58:52,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I took your suit.</font>

1691
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.</font>

1693
01:58:57,796 --> 01:59:00,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?</font>

1694
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.</font>

1695
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:07,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.</font>

1696
01:59:08,307 --> 01:59:09,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you did the right thing.</font>

1697
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:13,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...</font>

1698
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, not my best analogy.</font>

1699
01:59:16,565 --> 01:59:18,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong about you.</font>

1700
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, with a little more mentoring...</font>

1701
01:59:21,445 --> 01:59:23,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could be a real asset to the team.</font>

1702
01:59:25,699 --> 01:59:27,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To the... To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...</font>

1705
01:59:33,457 --> 01:59:35,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">why don't you try that on?</font>

1713
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.</font>

1714
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:04,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or walls.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Mr. Stark.</font>

1717
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm good.</font>

1718
02:00:17,543 --> 02:00:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're good? Good... How are you good?</font>

1719
02:00:20,212 --> 02:00:24,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?</font>

1722
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're turning me down?</font>

1723
02:00:30,931 --> 02:00:33,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better think about this. Look at that.</font>

1724
02:00:33,184 --> 02:00:34,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

1725
02:00:35,185 --> 02:00:36,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last chance. Yes or no?</font>

1726
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:37,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Okay.</font>

1727
02:00:37,896 --> 02:00:41,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.</font>

1728

<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy will take you home.</font>

1729
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>

1730
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:47,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.</font>

1731
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:51,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.</font>

1732
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you around.
- Okay.</font>

1733
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a test, right?</font>

1734
02:01:03,881 --> 02:01:06,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.</font>

1735
02:01:07,217 --> 02:01:10,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.</font>

1736
02:01:10,262 --> 02:01:11,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, thank you.</font>

1737
02:01:14,057 --> 02:01:15,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told you he's a good kid.</font>

1738
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the kid?
- He left.</font>

1739
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.</font>

1740
02:01:26,904 --> 02:01:29,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?</font>

1741
02:01:30,073 --> 02:01:32,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?</font>

1742
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:34,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a room full of people
in there waiting...</font>

1743
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?</font>

1744
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:39,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of something. How about...</font>

1745
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:41,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I... I...</font>

1746
02:01:42,002 --> 02:01:43,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?</font>

1747
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:46,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been carrying this since 2008.</font>

1748
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1749
02:01:50,511 --> 02:01:52,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I can think
of something better than that.</font>

1750
02:01:52,262 --> 02:01:54,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it would buy us a little time.</font>

1751
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:58,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like we need time.</font>

1752
02:01:58,228 --> 02:01:59,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe you have that in your pocket.</font>

1753
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:02,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.</font>

1754
02:02:18,747 --> 02:02:21,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aunt May, did you do dinner already?</font>

1755
02:02:31,469 --> 02:02:33,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">May?</font>

1756
02:02:54,908 --> 02:02:55,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...</font>

1757
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:12,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who it is.</font>

1758
02:05:13,922 --> 02:05:17,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?</font>

1759
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

1760
02:05:19,177 --> 02:05:21,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">This? It's not on you.</font>

1761
02:05:21,346 --> 02:05:24,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on our little spider friend.</font>

1762
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.</font>

1763
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.</font>

1764
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I heard a rumor.</font>

1765
02:05:37,863 --> 02:05:39,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who he is.</font>

1766
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I knew who he was...</font>

1767
02:05:45,704 --> 02:05:47,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd already be dead.</font>

1768
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toomes, your family's here!</font>

1769
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:36,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...</font>

1770
02:12:36,823 --> 02:12:40,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.</font>

1771
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Patience.</font>

1772
02:12:42,787 --> 02:12:44,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes patience is the key to victory.</font>

1773
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:47,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it leads to very little...</font>

1774
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:49,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it seems like it's not worth it.</font>

1775
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you wonder...</font>

1776
02:12:51,463 --> 02:12:55,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.</font>

1777
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:01,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many more of these?</font>
