1
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares about
winning? Let's get drunk!</font>

3
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's do it.</font>

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get you drunk, Merkins.
You, too, Borgs.</font>

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm thirsty. Huh?</font>

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need four shots of vodka,
four shots of water.</font>

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to send the vodka
over to the Merkins.</font>

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send the water to us. You understand?</font>

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What former
Supreme Court Justice...</font>

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oliver Wendell Holmes!
- Correct.</font>

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, I'd like to ask the players
to allow me to...</font>

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">T o finish the question.</font>

14
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very funny.</font>

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.
This is getting embarrassing,</font>

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we need to focus</font>

17
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">because this isn't a game.</font>

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It literally is.</font>

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bill, do not test me right now.</font>

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like
we're down to two teams.</font>

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, for double points,</font>

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">what is the name
of the purple Teletubby?</font>

23
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tinky Winky!
- You're both correct.</font>

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">He always carried a...</font>

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Red purse.
- Yeah.</font>

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And he loved big hugs.
- Big hugs.</font>

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I'm Max.</font>

28
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie.</font>

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able
to hold on to Asia! You hear me?</font>

30
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, if you take Kamchatka,
and I take Mongolia,</font>

31
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">we could trap Linda in the middle.</font>

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Starve out her armies.
- Hey!</font>

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't form alliances.</font>

34
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?</font>

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're high-fiving Hitler?</font>

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you got this. Last one.</font>

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.</font>

38
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm up. I feel good.</font>

40
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two words.</font>

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bill. Overweight.</font>

42
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Single. Out of work.</font>

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hairy.</font>

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, carry, marry.</font>

46
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marry!</font>

47
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. Me.</font>

48
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marry me?</font>

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, we got it! We got it!</font>

50
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, will you?</font>

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you marry me?</font>

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that a yes? That's a yes!
- Yeah!</font>

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really happy for you guys.</font>

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh, lot of pressure here.
- Yeah.</font>

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You miss, you lose it all.</font>

56
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay out of my head.</font>

57
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know you have a distinct
advantage with the smaller hands, right?</font>

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your goal posts are not as big.</font>

59
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess you
should've married Uma Thurman.</font>

60
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that would've been great.</font>

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a snap. Here's the hold.</font>

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ooh!
- And a text.</font>

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was interference.</font>

64
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, honey. I know how much
that meant to you.</font>

65
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Chin is ready for you.</font>

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, great.</font>

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we've determined why you've
been having trouble conceiving.</font>

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Let's have it.
- Okay, great.</font>

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what's that look? Is it me?
Of course, it's me.</font>

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not loving your semen.</font>

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh?</font>

73
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your count is excellent,
but your motility is well below normal.</font>

74
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's too bad.
- What would cause that?</font>

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can be genetic,
environmental factors.</font>

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nine times out of 10, though,
it's psychological.</font>

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been feeling
anxious or stressed?</font>

78
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think so. Not really.</font>

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... He's always a little stressed.</font>

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to write... I'm not...</font>

81
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, she's writing it down.</font>

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.</font>

83
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sure are.</font>

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the reasons
I fell in love with him.</font>

85
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more
prone to stress than normal people.</font>

86
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Normal people"?</font>

87
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has this been going on, Max?</font>

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not going on.</font>

89
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, you did say,
even when you were a kid,</font>

90
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would freak out
if you lost at anything.</font>

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I was a kid.
- Especially if you lost to your brother.</font>

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is that what this is?</font>

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been so uptight since you
found out that Brooks is coming to town.</font>

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't think that's true.
- Could that be a factor in all this?</font>

97
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's be fair.</font>

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.</font>

99
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.</font>

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The what?
- The brothers.</font>

101
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure why we're discussing this.
She's not a therapist.</font>

102
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a therapist, right?
With all respect.</font>

103
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, but I am a doctor.
- Sure.</font>

104
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I believe in
treating the whole patient.</font>

105
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what is it about your brother
that makes you feel emasculated?</font>

106
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we gonna do this?</font>

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're right next to the room
where I masturbated.</font>

108
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he has it in his head
that Brooks is cooler</font>

109
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">and more successful
and hotter than he is.</font>

110
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said hotter.</font>

111
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's charming.</font>

112
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's interesting. And is he single?</font>

113
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

114
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if I mentioned it, but
Keith and I are on a trial separation.</font>

115
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- Keith?</font>

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Keith.</font>

117
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, do you think your brother would
wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?</font>

118
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gosh, I don't know.</font>

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.</font>

120
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurts a little.</font>

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, is he a tall fellow?
'Cause I'm only 5'2".</font>

122
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all done with my semen?</font>

123
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is taller than Max.</font>

124
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good.
- But he did date this ballerina once,</font>

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she was
just a teeny-tiny little thing.</font>

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh.</font>

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, Gary.
Don't mention game night, okay?</font>

128
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

129
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good evening, Max.
- Hey, Gary.</font>

130
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Annie.
- Hello there.</font>

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Gary!</font>

132
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just checking the mail.</font>

133
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?</font>

134
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people check it earlier in the day,</font>

135
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">but there's always a risk
that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.</font>

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">This spares me the chance
of a futile trip to the mailbox.</font>

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

138
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, it allows Bastian here
the opportunity to urinate.</font>

139
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a good one.</font>

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any plans for this evening?</font>

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

142
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps a game night?</font>

143
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna stay in,</font>

144
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- just the two of us.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Boring.
- Mmm.</font>

146
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights.</font>

148
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bet.</font>

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always enjoyed
the camaraderie of good friends</font>

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">competing in games of chance and skill.</font>

151
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Yeah, well, we'll do that,</font>

152
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">but tonight, it's just the two of us.</font>

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.</font>

154
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a special on these tonight.</font>

155
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three for one.</font>

156
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three for one?</font>

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

158
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can that be profitable
for Frito Lay?</font>

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">These corporations,</font>

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what they're doing.</font>

161
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you two enjoy each other.</font>

162
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's often we don't appreciate
what we have until it's gone.</font>

163
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think that's it.
- Okay.</font>

164
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye!</font>

165
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Gary sees the others coming,
we're screwed.</font>

166
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, honey,
it's not gonna be a problem.</font>

167
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was very, very clear with everyone
to park far away</font>

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">and just to sneak in quietly, you know.</font>

169
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">But now, I mean, you don't think
we're being dicks, do you?</font>

170
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
should we just still invite the guy?</font>

171
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">He really seemed like he wanted to play.</font>

172
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Debbie was our friend,</font>

173
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Gary was just the creepy husband
that we had to put up with.</font>

174
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true.</font>

175
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's only gotten worse
since the divorce.</font>

176
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?
Fuck him!</font>

177
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!</font>

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

179
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we help you?</font>

180
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay.</font>

181
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Ryan, why are you
coming in through the window?</font>

183
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said sneak in
so RoboCop wouldn't see us.</font>

184
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant sneak in through the door.</font>

185
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you were super vague.</font>

186
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wasn't vague at all.
- Wine?</font>

187
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I didn't say,
"Break the succulents."</font>

188
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.</font>

189
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous.</font>

190
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like
Night of the Living Dead in here.</font>

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.</font>

192
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say
to come through the window.</font>

193
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Max. We used to work together.</font>

194
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His wife, Annie. Michelle.
- Hey!</font>

195
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that guy, Kevin.</font>

196
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's up, buddy?
- The door was right there.</font>

197
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, this is Madison.</font>

198
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you brought her last week.</font>

199
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work at Forever 21, right?</font>

200
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no.
- I work at Sephora.</font>

201
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm confused.
- Different girl.</font>

202
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same look, same voice.</font>

203
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you.</font>

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too.</font>

205
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's yours.
- It's...</font>

206
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I think you're
supposed to kiss it, right?</font>

207
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome.</font>

208
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you guys have a bathroom?</font>

209
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one just down the hall.
You need it?</font>

210
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, is it on the right or the left?
I don't wanna go in the wrong room.</font>

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one with the toilet.</font>

212
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can't miss it.
- Okay.</font>

213
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, boy.
- Dude!</font>

214
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?
- Right?</font>

215
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, at Chipotle.</font>

216
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you something, Ryan.</font>

217
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you sick of
losing game night every week</font>

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of the dates you bring?</font>

219
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not always that bad.</font>

220
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heather, seriously.</font>

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many photos of you
with the dog filter do you need?</font>

222
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.</font>

223
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, yeah, it is.
It's my daddy's name, so...</font>

224
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are the elite,
the very best, the...</font>

225
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh! White people!</font>

226
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Oh, Jesus.</font>

227
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, unlike you psychos,</font>

228
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a shit
about winning game night.</font>

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need that validation.</font>

230
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you do need the validation
of dating Instagram models?</font>

231
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely.</font>

232
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I'm not like you, Michelle.</font>

233
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't all meet our soul mate
when we were 10 years old.</font>

234
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">14.</font>

235
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, sorry.
- 14.</font>

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we didn't get married
until we were 19.</font>

237
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See, that's gross.
- You know what, Ryan?</font>

238
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope one day you
get to meet a lovely, young lady.</font>

239
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can love her as much as
I love my sweet baby right here.</font>

240
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, find her. Look how cute this...</font>

241
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, look at this.
- So much love.</font>

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's look at him when we do it.</font>

243
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.
- Find the love!</font>

244
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go play, come on.</font>

245
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, do you know what rich people are
doing on their game nights these days?</font>

246
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

247
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fight clubs.
- What?</font>

248
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just read about them.</font>

249
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">They pay poor people
to fight each other,</font>

250
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then they bet on the winner.</font>

251
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, that's not a real thing.
- Yes, it is!</font>

252
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can have anything
you want in this world,</font>

253
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to raise the stakes,
or life gets boring.</font>

254
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Kennedys used to have fight clubs
at their compound.</font>

255
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading
BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.</font>

256
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about some charades?
Huh, should we start with charades?</font>

257
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go!
- Yeah!</font>

258
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a while, huh?</font>

259
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you wanna wait for Brooks?</font>

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we need to. No, he's late.</font>

261
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?
- Yeah.</font>

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he was working in Europe.</font>

263
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was, yeah. He's apparently back
for some business.</font>

264
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't seen him yet.</font>

265
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But we can get started.
- Yeah!</font>

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who wants to start?
- Who are you guys talking about?</font>

267
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max's brother. He's this super
successful venture capitalist.</font>

268
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he was the first to invest
in Panera Bread, you know?</font>

269
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.</font>

270
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A lot of investors.
- Yeah.</font>

271
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like the Mark Wahlberg
to Max's Donnie.</font>

272
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

273
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is a huge compliment</font>

274
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">because Donnie was fucking great
in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?</font>

275
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was.</font>

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he in The Sixth Sense?</font>

277
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sure is, yeah.
You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?</font>

278
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark Wahlberg.</font>

279
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark would never take a role that small.</font>

280
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right, Madison?</font>

281
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I haven't seen him
since the wedding.</font>

282
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remember that speech he gave?
- Yes.</font>

283
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he paid
for that whole firework display!</font>

284
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!
- Little over the top.</font>

285
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get started.
I'm gonna start us off.</font>

286
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, let's start!
- Here we go. Let's do it.</font>

287
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta pick teams first.</font>

288
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Movie?
- It's a movie. Okay.</font>

289
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dude, we have no teams.
- You just give up?</font>

290
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better not be Brooks.</font>

291
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell him
to park up the street?</font>

292
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did, yeah, like, three times.</font>

293
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

294
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got a Stingray, huh?</font>

295
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn off your car!</font>

296
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

297
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, again.</font>

298
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm...</font>

299
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still wearing the uniform.</font>

300
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.</font>

301
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you didn't start
game night without me.</font>

302
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you not get my text?</font>

303
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">What text?</font>

304
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello, Officer.</font>

305
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why's that guy staring at us?</font>

306
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary, I want you
to meet my brother, Brooks.</font>

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're having a little family
three-man game night tonight.</font>

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what do you mean three-man?</font>

309
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said that Michelle
and Ryan and Kevin were...</font>

310
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.</font>

311
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see them in the doorway.</font>

312
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a whole mess of people.
Hey, guys!</font>

313
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There they are.
- Hey!</font>

314
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys are leaving.</font>

315
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off, guys.</font>

316
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a little bit
of a mix-up with the, um...</font>

317
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">- God damn it!
- What?</font>

318
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't want him to know
that we're having a game night.</font>

319
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used to come, and we don't
like him anymore, so...</font>

320
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

321
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I think he knows now.</font>

322
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sure does.</font>

323
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.</font>

324
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't seen you in a year!</font>

325
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you smell good.</font>

326
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?
Head and Shoulders?</font>

327
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you assume
it's a dandruff shampoo?</font>

328
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, you've always
been a little bit of a snowstorm.</font>

329
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, would you hold that for a second?
- Yup.</font>

330
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys!</font>

331
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you look good, stranger.</font>

332
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been forever.</font>

333
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, and that's my fault.
I'm so sorry.</font>

334
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet ride, Brooks.</font>

335
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you like that?
I just got her a couple weeks ago.</font>

336
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? A Corvette?</font>

337
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.</font>

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my dream car as a kid.</font>

339
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what
gave me the idea to get it.</font>

340
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? I love your house.</font>

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you being sarcastic?</font>

342
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean I love your house.</font>

343
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.</font>

344
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes me think of simpler times.</font>

345
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Simpler"?</font>

346
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, so, how long are you in town for?</font>

347
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'm not sure.</font>

348
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It depends on how many clients</font>

349
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">the firm's gonna be
having me schmooze while I'm here.</font>

350
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">But hopefully for a while.</font>

351
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get to see you guys, and I...</font>

352
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I really miss you, man.
I really do.</font>

353
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

354
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss you, too, Brooks.</font>

355
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">And go!</font>

356
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.</font>

357
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.</font>

358
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. You got it.</font>

359
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quick story.
- There's no pausing.</font>

360
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember the urban myth where
Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out</font>

361
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he could go down on himself?</font>

362
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

363
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't mind me telling the story,
do you, Max?</font>

364
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the middle of a...</font>

365
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were 14 years old.
It's an adorable story.</font>

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forbid it.</font>

367
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little curious.</font>

368
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you blow yourself?</font>

369
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the bungee cords on roof racks?</font>

370
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

371
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max took one of those bungee cords,
and he put it around his neck.</font>

372
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he goes.</font>

373
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he wrapped it behind his legs</font>

374
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he could squish his face
down into his crotch,</font>

375
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the problem was</font>

376
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it got stuck!
He couldn't unhook it.</font>

377
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And about an hour later</font>

378
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom comes home, and she finds him there.</font>

379
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

380
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her little pretzel boy
on his bedroom floor naked.</font>

381
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little pretzel boy?</font>

382
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great story. Are we back on now?</font>

383
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

384
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">"So" what?</font>

385
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you suck it?</font>

386
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Come on. Brooks.</font>

387
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back to it. Come on. Play the game.</font>

388
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor man's Johnny Depp,
starred in Jericho.</font>

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">UN Secretary General '92 to '96.</font>

391
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</font>

392
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy. He hated kids
in Jurassic Park.</font>

393
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Sam Neill.</font>

394
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.</font>

395
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Skrillex.
- Yep.</font>

396
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rappers love this Cubist painter.
- Picasso!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many?
- Seven!</font>

400
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven!</font>

401
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're up, pretzel boy.</font>

402
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo! Go, Max!</font>

403
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, Max.
- All right. Here we go.</font>

404
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">And kick it. Go!</font>

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is easy!</font>

406
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie, the famous actor that we met
at the airport about eight years ago.</font>

407
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

408
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only actor we've ever met
at an airport who's famous.</font>

409
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bobby Flay?</font>

410
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not an actor. This fellow was
in front of us at the Sbarro.</font>

411
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were wondering why he
wasn't in the first-class lounge.</font>

412
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, yes.</font>

413
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was that?</font>

414
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

415
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max, there's a whole room of people
to help you out here.</font>

416
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Use us.
- Good point.</font>

417
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the Incredible Hulk.</font>

418
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric Bana.</font>

419
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,711

<font color="#FFFFFF">Primal Fear!</font>

426
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

427
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the Hulk.</font>

428
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Hulk.
- I forgot that.</font>

429
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max. Zero points.</font>

430
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say he blew it,
but he won't tell us, will he?</font>

431
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit! Did you?</font>

432
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.</font>

433

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys! What do you say
we do this at my house next week?</font>

434
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- House? What house?
- Ooh. Really?</font>

435
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I don't know how long
I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.</font>

436
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only a couple miles away.</font>

437
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's up on Broadmoor.</font>

438
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Swanky neighborhood.</font>

439
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a very cool house,
but it's just me there alone.</font>

440
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'd be great
to have you guys come over.</font>

441
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition
to have game nights here.</font>

442
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what?</font>

443
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's let him show off
his big house, huh?</font>

444
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the spirit!</font>

445
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me.</font>

446
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will be a game night to remember.</font>

447
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, boy.
- Mmm.</font>

448
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise?</font>

449
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, everybody.
I love you much. Drive safely.</font>

450
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kisses!
- All right.</font>

451
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take it easy.
- Bye.</font>

452
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That little motherfucker.</font>

453
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

454
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, come on.</font>

455
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't see him in over a year.</font>

456
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shows up in your dream car,</font>

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">insults our house, and then tells
an embarrassing story about you</font>

458
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">right before your turn
just to throw you off your game.</font>

459
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to my whole life. Why are you
suddenly so worked up about it?</font>

460
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, cause now
he's messing with your balls</font>

461
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">and literally killing
millions of our babies.</font>

462
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a little dramatic,</font>

463
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, yeah, you know,
I mean, that's Brooks.</font>

464
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that this
was just regular old brother stuff,</font>

465
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but I totally see it now.
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

466
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">He undermines you every chance he gets.</font>

467
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</font>

468
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's crazy!
- Thank you, Annie.</font>

469
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've never won
a single game against him.</font>

470
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just...</font>

471
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.</font>

472
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fix it?
- Yeah.</font>

473
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you suggesting?</font>

474
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm suggesting we beat his ass.</font>

475
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

476
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

477
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna skip the cleanup?</font>

478
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?</font>

479
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.</font>

480
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna stay alert and ready.
- Evening!</font>

481
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, Gary!</font>

482
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you headed?</font>

483
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are going to, uh, to my brother's.</font>

484
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another game night?</font>

485
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, absolutely not.</font>

486
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to, um,</font>

487
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">have some dinner.</font>

488
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat.</font>

489
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

490
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity. I was going to invite you
over for a dinner I'm hosting.</font>

491
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've purchased four lamb shanks</font>

492
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I've been simmering
in a broth of red wine and rosemary.</font>

493
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds so yummy, though.</font>

494
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

495
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was actually Debbie's recipe.</font>

496
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like to think she left behind her
recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,</font>

497
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it was most likely
an unintentional oversight.</font>

498
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here we go.</font>

499
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

500
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

501
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said something.</font>

502
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Nope, not us.</font>

503
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

504
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have fun.</font>

505
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck me.</font>

506
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guy who rents a house this big</font>

507
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">must be making up for something
pretty small, I'd say.</font>

508
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. No, I've seen his dick.
It's pretty great.</font>

509
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I tried.</font>

510
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- Hey!</font>

511
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- How are you doing, beautiful?</font>

512
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good, good. Really fancy.
- Very nice house, Tony Stark.</font>

513
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we give
our drink orders to Jarvis?</font>

514
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I got the Tony Stark part,
but then you went full nerd on me.</font>

515
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kind of lost you,
but please do come in.</font>

516
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

517
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, Cap.
- Hi, guys!</font>

518
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up?</font>

519
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, could sleep four
on that couch. Look at that.</font>

520
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hello, friends.</font>

521
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, let me introduce you to my date.
This is Sarah.</font>

522
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah is head of company accounting
at our office.</font>

523
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, corporate communications.</font>

524
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she's also British,
which means she's smart as shit.</font>

525
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Irish.
- Okay? Same island.</font>

526
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's really not.</font>

527
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Nice to meet you, too.</font>

528
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Max.
- Annie.</font>

529
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you can't always judge a book
by its past covers, can you?</font>

530
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm.
- Almost a saying.</font>

531
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here you go.
- Hey, Brooks.</font>

532
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cheers.
- We didn't know if you had any games,</font>

533
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we thought we'd bring you
a few of our favorites.</font>

534
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look at that.</font>

535
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

536
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh.
- The poor games.</font>

537
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you we're taking it up a notch.</font>

538
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game that we're
gonna play tonight is so epic</font>

539
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we don't need a board,
and we do not need pieces.</font>

540
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still didn't need to throw them
across the room.</font>

541
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was being theatrical.</font>

542
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?</font>

543
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">A what?</font>

544
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's when rich people
pay poor people to fight each other...</font>

545
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
Stop with the fight club, okay?</font>

546
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's nonsense.
- No.</font>

547
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ryan believes everything he reads.</font>

548
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

549
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what are we playing?</font>

550
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the next hour, someone in this room
is going to be taken.</font>

551
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's gonna be up to you to find them
before they are murdered.</font>

552
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! It's a murder mystery party.</font>

553
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just any murder mystery.</font>

554
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found this company.
They do it super real.</font>

555
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">They use legit actors.</font>

556
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna know
what's real and what's fake.</font>

557
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fun!
- But that's not all</font>

558
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">because whoever finds the victim
wins the grand prize.</font>

559
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">The keys to the Stingray.</font>

560
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Wow.</font>

561
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just the keys?</font>

562
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Ryan, the whole car.</font>

563
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes! Oh, man!</font>

564
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so lucky I brought you
to this game night</font>

565
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and not one of Max and Annie's.
- Hey!</font>

566
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.
- Oh.</font>

567
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna actually
give away your car?</font>

568
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's just a tax write-off.</font>

569
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the Audi, it's more practical.</font>

570
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that makes sense to me.</font>

571
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. How do we start?</font>

572
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just wait for it to begin.</font>

573
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe play a drinking game
to pass the time?</font>

574
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">This group does not play drinking games.</font>

575
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight we do, Max.</font>

576
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh! "Never Have I Ever."
- Good one!</font>

577
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you believe this guy?</font>

578
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's ridiculous.</font>

579
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beautiful house, though.</font>

580
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good champagne.</font>

581
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

582
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup. We're at the house.</font>

583
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll let you know when we have him.</font>

584
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

585
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with that knife?</font>

586
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for the cheese.</font>

587
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right. Just, you know,</font>

588
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">really aggressive way to carry a knife.</font>

589
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I've got one.</font>

590
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never have I ever
connected my work computer</font>

591
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the projector in the conference room
when it was open on a WebMD page</font>

592
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">for chlamydia symptoms.</font>

593
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not cool!</font>

594
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink!</font>

595
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just for the record,
I did not have chlamydia.</font>

596
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was pubic dermatitis. You get it
from not washing your crotch, so...</font>

597
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Good for you.</font>

598
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I like her.</font>

599
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, listen, you're not supposed
to single people out in this game.</font>

600
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supposed to be generic things, like</font>

601
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Never have I ever slept
with a celebrity."</font>

602
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I didn't know. Okay.</font>

603
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font>

604
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm?
- Ooh.</font>

605
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

606
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slept with a celebrity?</font>

607
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I was taking a drink
separate from the game.</font>

608
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was bad timing.
- Mmm.</font>

609
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see how you would think, but it's not.</font>

610
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then why are you breathing
like you just got off the elliptical?</font>

611
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not. I'm...</font>

612
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, babe.
Whose turn is it?</font>

613
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?</font>

614
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not playing a drinking game.
Who was it?</font>

615
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:24,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the deal with that?</font>

616
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been together
since middle school.</font>

617
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's somebody else's turn.</font>

618
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. Oh!
- Yeah!</font>

619
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you possibly
have had sex with a celebrity</font>

620
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we've only had sex with each other?</font>

621
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, can you not make this
one of your things right now?</font>

622
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is this one of my things?</font>

623
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Brooks, this is why
we don't play drinking games.</font>

624
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like the game is afoot.</font>

625
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

626
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, God!</font>

627
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?</font>

628
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks Davis?</font>

629
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

630
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, shit.
- Ooh!</font>

631
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is good.</font>

632
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agent Henderson.</font>

633
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">FBI.</font>

634
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sunglasses at night. It's legit.</font>

635
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, please.</font>

636
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get right to the point.</font>

637
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bureau has been tracking a ring
of violent kidnappers</font>

638
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this very neighborhood.</font>

639
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have reason to believe
that one of you</font>

640
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">may be their next victim.</font>

641
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's terrible news.</font>

642
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contained within these dossiers</font>

643
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">are the clues you will require
to find the kidnappers.</font>

644
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like for us to do that, yeah?</font>

645
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bureau's...
What's the Bureau's role in this?</font>

646
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you guys could take my wife
in for questioning</font>

647
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">because, apparently, she got a
secret life I don't know nothing about.</font>

648
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Baby, this is...
- Shut up, all of you!</font>

649
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

650
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a joke.</font>

651
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">You people are in real danger,
and you're running out of time.</font>

652
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I, Agent Henderson,
will not stand idly by</font>

653
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">while innocent civilians
are slaughtered on my watch.</font>

654
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you
this is gonna be great.</font>

655
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's so good!
- So good.</font>

656
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, uh, before we get started,</font>

657
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm required to ask if any of you
have any food allergies.</font>

658
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peanuts?</font>

659
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

660
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

661
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now wait a second.
I know you're method and all,</font>

662
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't just come in here
and break the door.</font>

663
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not mind this game.</font>

664
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you crazy?</font>

665
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very well done.</font>

666
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

667
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a strong table.</font>

668
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!</font>

669
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell no!</font>

670
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh!</font>

671
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

672
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just making this
harder on yourself!</font>

673
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

674
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, make sure you
get a piece of this cheese. It's just...</font>

675
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cut me one.
- Try it with the quince.</font>

676
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

677
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's back.</font>

678
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop fighting, asshole!</font>

679
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me! This isn't...</font>

680
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Independent Spirit Award goes to...</font>

681
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

682
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye!</font>

683
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">First one that follows us gets shot!</font>

684
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, roger that. You drive safe.</font>

685
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, motherfucker!</font>

686
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was amazing.
- Really good.</font>

687
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was really good.
- Wow.</font>

688
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. No, there's something about this
that just doesn't feel right.</font>

689
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you cheat on me
with a celebrity?</font>

690
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't cheat on you.</font>

691
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was before we got married
when we took that break.</font>

692
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</font>

693
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been living in The Matrix.</font>

694
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agent Henderson,
you just gonna keep lying there?</font>

695
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is any of this real?</font>

696
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't kick him!</font>

697
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop.
- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.</font>

698
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we both agreed</font>

699
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we wouldn't hook up
with anybody else during that break.</font>

700
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but then you went
and got a hand job from Karen Waller.</font>

701
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't do that.
- Boop! Boop! Boop!</font>

702
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it was over the pants,
all right?</font>

703
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,
and I didn't climax.</font>

704
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just admit it.
You guys did more than that.</font>

705
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't turn this around on me.
Do not do that.</font>

706
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!</font>

707
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it, they got the jump on us.</font>

708
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Shit, Kev!</font>

709
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on now!</font>

710
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Here's the first clue.
Looks like a riddle.</font>

711
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">"With shiny fangs..."</font>

712
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My bloodless bite..."</font>

713
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Will bring together
what's mostly white."</font>

714
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Donald Trump.</font>

715
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.
Um...</font>

716
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just Google it.</font>

717
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so inconsistent, isn't it?</font>

718
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, they stage
this super realistic fight.</font>

719
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">They give us an FBI dossier
but with riddles.</font>

720
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like, let's pick a tone.
Let's stick with it.</font>

721
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's the game.
You wanna win this car or not?</font>

722
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. More than anything,</font>

723
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.</font>

724
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you get that feeling? You know,</font>

725
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this is some game
where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?</font>

726
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-hmm.</font>

727
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's not play by his rules.</font>

728
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My bloodless bite, my bloodless,
bloodless bite.</font>

729
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,
bloodless bite."</font>

730
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?
It's just...</font>

731
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Trying to think.
- Yeah.</font>

732
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

733
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max and Annie must have figured it out.</font>

734
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. We need to find an advantage.</font>

735
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Advantage, advantage, advantage...</font>

736
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks' wallet?</font>

737
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think we should steal
all of his shit!</font>

738
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

739
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.</font>

740
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering if you could tell me
what the last few charges I made were.</font>

741
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

742
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can find out the name
of the murder mystery place he used,</font>

743
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can go to their office and
pay them off to give us the final clue.</font>

744
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</font>

745
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're, like, a double threat.
Brains and you're British.</font>

746
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

747
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:31,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. What has shiny fangs
that bites white things together?</font>

748
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stapler!</font>

749
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the white things are paper.</font>

750
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!</font>

751
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there it is.</font>

752
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

753
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that.</font>

754
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Flash drive.
- Put it in the desktop.</font>

755
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

756
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another riddle.</font>

757
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm brown and old by day,
white and young by night.</font>

758
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My eyes are glass.</font>

759
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I have nine faces but no head.</font>

760
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I sing to the sky but have no voice.</font>

761
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm everywhere and nowhere."</font>

762
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is that?</font>

763
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, how cool are we?</font>

764
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very, very cool. We are very cool.
- Right?</font>

765
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the cool one. You know,
tracking the phone is just a great idea.</font>

766
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still on Route 18, huh?</font>

767
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're catching up to them.
Here we come, Brooksie.</font>

768
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you imagine the look on his face
when we find him so fast?</font>

769
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, baby, I can feel my sperm
already coming back to life.</font>

770
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Perfect.
- Yeah.</font>

771
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll win your brother's car,
and then we'll go make a baby in it.</font>

772
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?
- Yeah.</font>

773
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't wanna do that.
- No, me neither.</font>

774
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, don't know why I said that.
- I'm not into that.</font>

775
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not a great idea.
- Okay.</font>

776
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, great. Thank you.</font>

777
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I got the name
and the address of the games company.</font>

778
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- Yes!</font>

779
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we have to do now,
figure out what "bloodless bite" means.</font>

780
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we don't. That's why...</font>

781
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.</font>

782
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you gonna be old and young?</font>

783
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That doesn't make sense.
- I know.</font>

784
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, hey, how's it goin'?</font>

785
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to wish you
the best of luck tonight. Bye.</font>

786
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

787
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are... What are you doing?</font>

788
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just being a dick.</font>

789
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

790
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't kick him, Ryan!
- He's such a good actor!</font>

791
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ryan!</font>

792
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

793
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, hand me those matches.
I'm about to burn this door down.</font>

794
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna light a fire in
a windowless room that we're trapped in?</font>

795
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.
He talked to you about flames?</font>

796
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about that?</font>

797
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where could he be?</font>

798
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">His phone stopped right here, huh?</font>

799
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hear that?
- Yeah.</font>

800
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh.</font>

801
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found it!</font>

802
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must've known we were tracking him.</font>

803
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they outsmarted us.</font>

804
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

805
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that one of the actors?</font>

806
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess they're not
so smart after all, huh?</font>

807
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess not. We are nailing this!</font>

808
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we crouching?</font>

809
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. It feels right.</font>

810
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's horrible in here.</font>

811
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.
- Ugh.</font>

812
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh. There he is. There he is.
Don't let him see you. Come on.</font>

813
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down right here.</font>

814
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bartender, sir,
can I ask you a question?</font>

815
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

816
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, um...</font>

817
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't happen to see a fellow
brought in here,</font>

818
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">looks a little bit like me,</font>

819
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's got a little bit
of a sharper chin</font>

820
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">and higher cheekbones?</font>

821
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a better-looking guy?</font>

822
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, well, I wouldn't call it that.</font>

823
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see nothing.</font>

824
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, boy. You hear that?
- Huh. Yeah.</font>

825
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">That double negative?
"Didn't see nothing"?</font>

826
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a little forced, right?
- Yeah, I think he's in on it.</font>

827
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 'Course he is.
- Look at those tats.</font>

828
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">So fresh, probably fake.</font>

829
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell you what.
Let's give him a test, okay?</font>

830
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's order a couple of drinks that only
a real bartender would know how to make.</font>

831
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, smart! Yes.</font>

832
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir! Excuse me. Hi.
- Barkeep.</font>

833
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally forgot to order drinks.</font>

834
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, uh...</font>

835
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I please have a vodka tonic?</font>

836
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, honey.</font>

837
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.</font>

838
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Appreciate it.</font>

839
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus! Did you see that look?</font>

840
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy doesn't know what's going on.</font>

841
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think you stumped him.</font>

842
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Regional theater hack.</font>

843
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

844
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.</font>

845
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to get out of the house.</font>

846
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, we're not gonna be able
to do stuff like this if we have kids.</font>

847
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yeah.</font>

848
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Well, I don't know.</font>

849
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking about it.
Remember Dan and Linda?</font>

850
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember how much time
we used to spend with them?</font>

851
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tons of fun.
And then they had those twins.</font>

852
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom! Off the grid, right?</font>

853
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time we saw them
was their Christmas card</font>

854
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the wonky kids on it.</font>

855
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.
They look so happy.</font>

856
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know what I mean.</font>

857
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't see them...
- Vodka tonic.</font>

858
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harvey Wallbanger.</font>

859
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.</font>

860
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers.</font>

861
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he get it right?</font>

862
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. I do not know. I realized I've
never had one of these,</font>

863
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that is a tasty drink.
It's kind of tart.</font>

864
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!</font>

865
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey! There's Brooks!</font>

866
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks is here. Brooks is here.
We're about to win this thing!</font>

867
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, yes!
- Look who came in here.</font>

868
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! No! I think he made us.</font>

869
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what? It's over.
What, are they gonna try to stop us?</font>

870
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- Yeah, probably.</font>

871
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's why I brought this.</font>

872
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, honey!
Where did you get a gun?</font>

873
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, that's the fake gun
from Brooks' fight.</font>

874
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.
- Yeah, well, you know...</font>

875
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Brooks never spares any expense.
- Look at that.</font>

876
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, that's true.
- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?</font>

877
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What are you doing?</font>

878
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lead?</font>

879
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of you fucking pricks move,</font>

880
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll execute every motherfucking
last one of you!</font>

881
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very nice, honey.</font>

882
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pulp Fiction, anybody?
Right? It's a classic.</font>

883
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">We love films.</font>

884
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, what the fuck is this shit?</font>

885
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're gonna hand over the keys
'cause we're gonna take my brother.</font>

886
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit.</font>

887
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! You know what's bullshit
is your bald, ugly face.</font>

888
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-uh. No, that's personal.
Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.</font>

889
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm sorry I called you bald,
you little bitch!</font>

890
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's, again, you know...</font>

891
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let the gun do the talking. Come on.
- Okay. Ah!</font>

892
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your knees. Hands in the air.</font>

893
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good. Good. Great.
- Heads on the ground. Eyes closed.</font>

894
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Get them up, reach for it.</font>

895
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hands up! That's right.
- There we go.</font>

896
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, hands in the air!
- Get them up!</font>

897
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yep.
- Yo, where's my head go?</font>

898
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Down.
- On the floor.</font>

899
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just rest it.</font>

900
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed
to put my hands in the air</font>

901
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- with my head on the ground?
- Fucking exactly.</font>

902
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did have the same question.</font>

903
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Child's pose?
Do you guys know child's pose?</font>

904
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck is a child's pose, man?</font>

905
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've never done yoga?</font>

906
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, wow.
- No?</font>

907
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cover me.
- Show them, baby.</font>

908
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right. Arms out.
- Here she comes.</font>

909
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knees apart if you have back problems.</font>

910
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you're doing it right,</font>

911
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're really gonna feel that
lumbar opening up back there.</font>

912
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's put your head down.</font>

913
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.
Okay?</font>

914
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

915
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you just tell me who it was?</font>

916
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you, Kev. If I tell you,
you'll just obsess about it even more.</font>

917
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine. How about this?</font>

918
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I guess it right, you tell me.</font>

919
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

920
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it an actor?</font>

921
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. That tower is unstable.</font>

922
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not stable! Was he over 40?</font>

923
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Be careful.</font>

924
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. American?</font>

925
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

926
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Tommy Lee Jones.</font>

927
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Ew. No.</font>

928
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Denzel? Was it Denzel?
Denzel Washington?</font>

929
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't, unfortunately.</font>

930
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.</font>

931
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... Be careful.</font>

932
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Sweet freedom.</font>

933
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

934
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, this dumb-ass thought
he can keep us locked in here.</font>

935
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">But guess what?
You can't lock us in here!</font>

936
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, hate put us in here!</font>

937
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, baby.
- But love is gonna bust us out!</font>

938
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ahh!
- Oh, my God!</font>

939
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

940
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kev! Kev, are you okay?</font>

941
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby, I fell down.</font>

942
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">There it is.</font>

943
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!</font>

944
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, me, too.</font>

945
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I usually bring these girls
I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!</font>

946
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a breath of fresh air.</font>

947
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, thanks.</font>

948
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I usually go out with men
I find interesting and non-stupid,</font>

949
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">so this is a bit new for me, too.</font>

950
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

951
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we cool?</font>

952
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I say something wrong?</font>

953
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

954
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean I was wondering why you
asked me along tonight,</font>

955
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I know you
just needed a ringer, so...</font>

956
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, did you... You thought
this was a date? I didn't...</font>

957
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:22,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, actually.
Well, I was hoping it wasn't.</font>

958
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then why are you wearing lipstick?</font>

959
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.</font>

960
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you...</font>

961
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't touch a girl's mouth.</font>

962
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Are you scared I'm
gonna smear your lipstick...</font>

963
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! You bit me!</font>

964
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I'll bite you again.</font>

965
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's lipstick on here.</font>

966
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shut up!</font>

967
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you wiping off that date lipstick!</font>

968
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

969
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">That really hurt a little bit.</font>

970
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

971
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

972
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, excuse me?</font>

973
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay.</font>

974
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

975
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

976
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh! Oh, shit!</font>

977
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

978
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">God!</font>

979
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Bloody hell!</font>

980
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Phew!</font>

981
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys scared me so bad.
What are you doing?</font>

982
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is that?</font>

983
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Well, I just came from</font>

984
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">a six-hour murder mystery
where I played the corpse.</font>

985
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must've dozed off
before I had a chance to clean up.</font>

986
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you scared the shit out of us.</font>

987
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Thank you.</font>

988
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually that means a lot
'cause I do my own makeup.</font>

989
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of party
has a pregnant corpse?</font>

990
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm actually pregnant.
This isn't part of it. This is just...</font>

991
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

992
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Congrats.
- Thank you!</font>

993
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, we want you
to give us the final clue</font>

994
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the murder mystery
Brooks Davis ordered.</font>

995
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my gosh.
But that would ruin the fun.</font>

996
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want the fun.
We just wanna win.</font>

997
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I can't do that.</font>

998
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">This change your mind?</font>

999
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1000
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't...</font>

1001
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about this?</font>

1002
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

1003
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">You drive a hard bargain. Okay.</font>

1004
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take it up a notch.</font>

1005
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping I wasn't
gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.</font>

1006
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Final offer.</font>

1007
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? It doesn't matter
how slowly you slide it over!</font>

1008
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?</font>

1009
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Um, I don't know. Probably $100.
- Give her $100.</font>

1010
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a hundred.</font>

1011
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much have you got?</font>

1012
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">$17.</font>

1013
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">$17?</font>

1014
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brought $17 out?</font>

1015
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice!</font>

1016
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you!
- Cool.</font>

1017
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're just gonna keep it. I got you.</font>

1018
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back!</font>

1019
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy, can you just give us
the answer to the second riddle,</font>

1020
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause we're way behind.</font>

1021
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you get it?</font>

1022
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was not supposed to happen.</font>

1023
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what now? You guys already
did the breaking-in thing.</font>

1024
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! And get on the floor,
all of you!</font>

1025
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa!</font>

1026
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, you okay?</font>

1027
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Nathan, I'm not okay.</font>

1028
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two guys came in here and attacked me.</font>

1029
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- I know!</font>

1030
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I quit Disney Cruises
for this bullshit.</font>

1031
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:06,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can check,
but that doesn't make any sense.</font>

1032
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not wearing a jacket.</font>

1033
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it means, like a book jacket.</font>

1034
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would a book have a jacket?</font>

1035
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder We Wrote.</font>

1036
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glenda, something terrible has happened.</font>

1037
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1038
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nathan and I
showed up for the takeaway,</font>

1039
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Ron had been attacked.</font>

1040
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where? At the Brooks Davis house?</font>

1041
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Huh?</font>

1042
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1043
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everyone okay?</font>

1044
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. I'm not okay, Glenda!</font>

1045
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a throbbing headache,
and they took the host!</font>

1046
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who took him?
- Kidnappers!</font>

1047
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real ones! Dangerous fucking criminals!</font>

1048
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden</font>

1049
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">She lives for me</font>

1050
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sing into the mic.
- Jesus!</font>

1051
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1052
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her own motivation
She goes round, and she goes down on me</font>

1053
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you, Tats?</font>

1054
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got something to say? No? Boop.</font>

1055
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through</font>

1056
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:08,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">One stop to the rhythm that divides you</font>

1057
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you eyeing that, Ponytail.
Not on my watch!</font>

1058
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bingo! Bingo! I got them, baby.
Let's do this.</font>

1059
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Okay.</font>

1060
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, Brooks!</font>

1061
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guess who it is!
- Oh!</font>

1062
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready? Hello!</font>

1063
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look at that face!
- Oh, shit.</font>

1064
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is priceless!</font>

1065
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did not expect us this early,
did you?</font>

1066
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gotta capture this moment.
Honey, get in there.</font>

1067
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll take a quick little selfie here</font>

1068
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">and send it off to the losers.
One, two, three.</font>

1069
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheese!</font>

1070
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha!</font>

1071
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect. Oh, speak of the devil.</font>

1072
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's Ryan now,
probably calling begging for help.</font>

1073
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ugh!
- Ignore.</font>

1074
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a game, Max!</font>

1075
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus! Guys, it's a wrap in here, okay?</font>

1076
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:49,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show's over!</font>

1077
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:51,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm not a venture capitalist.
I'm a smuggler!</font>

1078
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A smuggler?
- Yeah, I made a mistake.</font>

1079
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sold the Bulgarian's egg
to a different guy.</font>

1080
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have to get it back to him,
or he's gonna kill me!</font>

1081
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Bulgarian's egg"? Wasn't that
the third Harry Potter book? Come on.</font>

1082
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I'm confused. So, this isn't
the end of this whole thing?</font>

1083
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it is the end, okay?</font>

1084
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said, whoever catches you
gets the car.</font>

1085
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found you, we get the car. Game over.</font>

1086
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I'm telling you! This is all real!</font>

1087
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shitty actors are real?
Come on.</font>

1088
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:14,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about that ridiculous fight?
Was that real?</font>

1089
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:15,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this gun real?</font>

1090
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Annie!</font>

1091
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:19,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. Oh, no. Bang, bang.</font>

1092
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

1093
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood!</font>

1094
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! I shot you!</font>

1095
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucking shot me!</font>

1096
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:38,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut me loose before we all get shot!</font>

1097
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, untie me!</font>

1098
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:40,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get me out of here!
- Oh, God!</font>

1099
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me. Help.</font>

1100
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1101
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:47,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go out! Go, go, go!
- What the fuck did you do to me?</font>

1102
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

1103
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- Where are the guns?</font>

1104
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shot me.</font>

1105
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I feel terrible.</font>

1106
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, man!
- Go! Go, go!</font>

1107
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

1108
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on!</font>

1109
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:01,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God!
- Move your ass!</font>

1110
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Honey, get in!
- Go, go!</font>

1111
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:04,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

1112
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

1113
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!</font>

1114
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- God damn it!
- Man, come on!</font>

1115
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks, what the fuck
is going on with you? Start talking!</font>

1116
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lied to you
and the family about what I do.</font>

1117
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I buy and I sell illegal shit for people
in the black market.</font>

1118
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? So you're a criminal?</font>

1119
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! They're following us!</font>

1120
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I made a mistake,
because there's this guy.</font>

1121
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call him the Bulgarian.</font>

1122
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got his fingers in all these pies
around the world.</font>

1123
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What kind of pies?
- Illegal pies, Max.</font>

1124
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the kind of pies that have
heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.</font>

1125
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, all that kind of stuff.</font>

1126
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he just wanted me to help him
find this Fabergé egg.</font>

1127
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck that! Fabergé egg?</font>

1128
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:47,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.</font>

1129
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I found it!</font>

1130
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then there was this other guy,
this Marlon Freeman.</font>

1131
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's willing to pay twice as much
for the same egg.</font>

1132
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what? So you screwed over
the Bulgarian guy</font>

1133
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">and those fellows behind us
work for him,</font>

1134
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they just happen to crash your
murder mystery party?</font>

1135
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, right?
What are the odds of that?</font>

1136
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, too close, too close!
- Careful, careful!</font>

1137
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:06,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out! Watch out!</font>

1138
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh!</font>

1139
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shit!
- Sorry! You okay?</font>

1140
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm all right.</font>

1141
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We need to go to the cops now!
- Yeah, right now! Let's go!</font>

1142
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:16,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can't go to the cops!
- Why?</font>

1143
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.</font>

1144
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">On his face?</font>

1145
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:21,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, in the police department.</font>

1146
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:23,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out!</font>

1147
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful!</font>

1148
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! This is insane!</font>

1149
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you call the cops,
I'll be dead before I get to jail.</font>

1150
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we just get a hold
of this Marlon Freeman guy</font>

1151
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">and buy the egg back from him?</font>

1152
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't find him if I wanted to.
That name's an alias.</font>

1153
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gun, gun, gun! Duck!
- Oh, oh...</font>

1154
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, these guys are not stopping.
What do we do?</font>

1155
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not gonna stop
until they get me.</font>

1156
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.</font>

1157
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1158
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for a lot of things.</font>

1159
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey! What are you doing?
- What is he doing? What is he doing?</font>

1160
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you, Max!
- Brooks, don't be an idiot!</font>

1161
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the car!</font>

1162
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shit! Go, go, go!
- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.</font>

1163
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck! What are we gonna do?
They're gonna kill my brother.</font>

1164
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Annie, I feel faint.
I'm gonna pass out.</font>

1165
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, honey, we'll get you
to a hospital, okay?</font>

1166
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no! No hospitals.</font>

1167
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a gunshot wound,
they'll call the cops.</font>

1168
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, shit! Okay.</font>

1169
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we go to a mob doctor, right?</font>

1170
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:00,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know one of those, sweetheart?</font>

1171
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No.</font>

1172
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about a veterinarian
that works for the mob?</font>

1173
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know one of those?
- No.</font>

1174
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Why are you pitching
all the mob stuff?</font>

1175
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!
- I get it.</font>

1176
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to do it.</font>

1177
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Yup.</font>

1178
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have
to take the bullet out.</font>

1179
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.</font>

1180
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:16,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I want you
to take the bullet out?</font>

1181
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you try to cut a chicken.
We have no other option.</font>

1182
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! This is so bad!</font>

1183
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate game night!</font>

1184
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

1185
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1186
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:32,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.
Listen, Annie. It's all real.</font>

1187
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I know.</font>

1188
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks is caught up in something and...</font>

1189
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, where are you guys?</font>

1190
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all at Brooks'.
Waiting to talk to the cops.</font>

1191
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!</font>

1192
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Why? What's going on?</font>

1193
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

1194
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're fine. We're fine.
I shot Max, but he's fine.</font>

1195
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1196
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. We will meet you
back at our house.</font>

1197
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you do,
do not tell the cops anything.</font>

1198
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks's life depends on it.</font>

1199
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hi.</font>

1200
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1201
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a bunch of stuff.</font>

1202
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1203
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:05,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pocket knife. Tweezers.</font>

1204
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sewing kit. Gauze.</font>

1205
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good, good. All right.
Wow, you did great!</font>

1206
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.</font>

1207
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:13,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they don't sell hard liquor,
so I got you this lovely chard.</font>

1208
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:16,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.</font>

1209
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else did you get, huh?
More good stuff?</font>

1210
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is helpful in Country Living?</font>

1211
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's for later. There's a corn
chowder recipe. It looks really good.</font>

1212
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You love corn chowder, huh?
- Sweet. I do, yeah.</font>

1213
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:28,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That'll cheer you up.
- Thank you.</font>

1214
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. And then a squeaky toy.</font>

1215
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:31,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh.
- For your mouth.</font>

1216
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For the pain.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1217
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.</font>

1218
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, let's see this bad boy.
- All right.</font>

1219
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, careful.</font>

1220
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- All right.</font>

1221
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

1222
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:42,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're gonna push past it.
- No problem. No problem.</font>

1223
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're gonna get the bullet out.
- Let's just Google.</font>

1224
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, can you return the text later?</font>

1225
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is instructions
on how to remove a bullet.</font>

1226
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, sorry.
- It's an alt-right militia website,</font>

1227
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'm just gonna
ignore the racist stuff.</font>

1228
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good. Good, good.
- Yeah?</font>

1229
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."</font>

1230
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check!</font>

1231
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're doing the best we can, right?</font>

1232
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.</font>

1233
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Step two."</font>

1234
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."</font>

1235
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, yeah.
That's gonna sting, isn't it?</font>

1236
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:07,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.</font>

1237
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:08,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's do it.
- Okay?</font>

1238
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">That smarts, huh?</font>

1239
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1240
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna administer anesthetic.</font>

1241
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't have that.
- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.</font>

1242
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Step four,
apply pressure above the wound."</font>

1243
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, you squeeze that there.</font>

1244
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:23,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I got it.
- Great. Thank you.</font>

1245
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna
make two tiny incisions...</font>

1246
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- On either side of the wound.</font>

1247
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy-peasy. Huh?</font>

1248
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is fun, huh?</font>

1249
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you having fun?
- No.</font>

1250
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get the bullet.</font>

1251
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Here we go.
- Let's get in there and get it.</font>

1252
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice and small, nice and small, baby.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.</font>

1253
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:39,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tiny, teeny.</font>

1254
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not small. That's really big!</font>

1255
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">So big?</font>

1256
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Way too big, baby.
It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.</font>

1257
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
This is my first time. I don't know...</font>

1258
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's so much blood.</font>

1259
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no. Don't you start doing that.
- No, you're gonna make...</font>

1260
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.</font>

1261
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at you,
and you're making me...</font>

1262
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't look at me.
I won't look at it.</font>

1263
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Push through. Let's go.
- Okay. All right, okay.</font>

1264
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No more cutting.
- Oh, shit.</font>

1265
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get the tweezers
and get the bullet out, baby.</font>

1266
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, shit, shit. Um...</font>

1267
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? What happened?
- Phone went to sleep.</font>

1268
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:13,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta set it so that thing stays on.</font>

1269
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. My phone doesn't do that.
- Sure it does.</font>

1270
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same phone as mine. Just change it.</font>

1271
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:18,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just gonna touch it with my nose
every 30 seconds. It's fine.</font>

1272
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid of your phone.
Get in there, go to the settings,</font>

1273
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">go to "Display" and change the timing
so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.</font>

1274
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Revert?
- Yeah.</font>

1275
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you, Steve Jobs?
I'm not reverting anything. No.</font>

1276
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm just
unafraid of my phone, honey.</font>

1277
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so fucking simple.</font>

1278
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?</font>

1279
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

1280
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1281
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here we go. Here we go.
- Here she goes.</font>

1282
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like a dolphin.</font>

1283
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. This part's gonna hurt.</font>

1284
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't... I don't doubt it.</font>

1285
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's do this.</font>

1286
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1287
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ooh... Oh, wait.</font>

1288
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

1289
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear that?</font>

1290
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that sound? What's that sound?</font>

1291
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the bullet?</font>

1292
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's bone!
- What?</font>

1293
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not right.</font>

1294
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Um, what do the racists say
if you can't find the bullet?</font>

1295
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.</font>

1296
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.</font>

1297
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max, did you get shot twice?</font>

1298
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the exit wound.</font>

1299
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it came out!</font>

1300
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup. Nothing to remove.</font>

1301
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bullet has exited the arm.</font>

1302
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's just sew
that sucker up, huh?</font>

1303
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:17,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1304
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...</font>

1305
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:23,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

1306
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1307
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,
and the only way to save him</font>

1308
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:32,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to get that egg
from this Marlon Freeman guy.</font>

1309
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe your brother's been
lying to us this whole time.</font>

1310
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's even cooler than we thought.</font>

1311
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, I think you sewed my arm
to my sleeve.</font>

1312
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't even know
Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.</font>

1313
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't those worth millions of dollars?</font>

1314
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:45,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Marlon Freeman,
but that's just an alias.</font>

1315
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:47,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somehow, we gotta find out
his real name, find out his address.</font>

1316
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Police computer.
- What do you mean?</font>

1317
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once dated this girl
whose father was a cop.</font>

1318
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:54,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">She showed me her dad's police computer.</font>

1319
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:56,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has a database with
every known alias on it.</font>

1320
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:59,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'
real name on it.</font>

1321
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if we called her up, would she
let you go on her dad's computer?</font>

1322
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. No way! That ended badly.</font>

1323
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how are we gonna get into a police
computer without the cops knowing?</font>

1324
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Billy Bob Thornton!
- What?</font>

1325
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?</font>

1326
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. Hang on. I know
where we can get on a police computer.</font>

1327
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- Gary!</font>

1328
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodness.</font>

1329
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what do
Bastian and I owe the pleasure?</font>

1330
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we were all just talking,</font>

1331
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we realized
we haven't had a game night in ages,</font>

1332
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">just the seven of us.</font>

1333
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:30,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1334
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were going
to your brother's house.</font>

1335
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said that.</font>

1336
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Gare Bear.
Live a little! It's the weekend!</font>

1337
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were just saying how you were always
better at games than Debbie was.</font>

1338
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll thank you
not to besmirch my ex-wife.</font>

1339
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">That woman is an angel.</font>

1340
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games
than you.</font>

1341
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will admit I have eagerly awaited
a visit such as this.</font>

1342
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd he go?</font>

1343
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we follow him?</font>

1344
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems like it.</font>

1345
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ryan, you go first.
- I'm scared.</font>

1346
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help yourself to popped corn
with sea salt.</font>

1347
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh!</font>

1348
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yummy, yummy.</font>

1349
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:23,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe that you read my mind.
I was craving popcorn.</font>

1350
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a framed photo of game night?</font>

1351
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't everyone have photographs
of their best friends in their homes?</font>

1352
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. We do.</font>

1353
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max, uh, you wanna go first?</font>

1354
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.</font>

1355
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. There's a loose one.</font>

1356
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always in the middle.
That's where you wanna go.</font>

1357
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I use your john real quick?</font>

1358
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
It's the end of the hall, next to our...</font>

1359
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">My bedroom.</font>

1360
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1361
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Gary.</font>

1362
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Sarah, how long have you two
been a couple?</font>

1363
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...</font>

1364
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:56,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">We work together. I wouldn't, um...
I wouldn't do that thing.</font>

1365
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see. I thought I detected a certain
chemistry between the two of you.</font>

1366
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No way.</font>

1367
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:07,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, that's not...
- Mmm. Mmm.</font>

1368
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then again, I'm not the best judge
of chemistry in the world.</font>

1369
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1370
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, because your wife left you.</font>

1371
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:24,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

1372
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Donald Anderton.</font>

1373
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1374
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many possible moves.
I just don't know where to begin.</font>

1375
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, maybe... Ooh...</font>

1376
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Decision-making.
- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.</font>

1377
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:00,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No!
- Please! No?</font>

1378
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, take your time.</font>

1379
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Brooks. What have you
gotten yourself into?</font>

1380
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit. Where did you
come from, little guy?</font>

1381
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch.
Hey! What are you, a vampire?</font>

1382
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Oh, God.</font>

1383
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God. Has that got it?</font>

1384
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that doesn't got it.
God damn it. Come on!</font>

1385
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1386
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go check on him.</font>

1387
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's fine.</font>

1388
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He cried out.
- Tell me about Debbie.</font>

1389
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon.</font>

1390
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just I... I never met her.
I'd love to hear all about her.</font>

1391
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do I begin?</font>

1392
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, you wanna take a bath?
We'll take a little bath.</font>

1393
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go. Okay.
All right. Here we go.</font>

1394
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">There we go, huh? Huh?</font>

1395
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:10,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's so much worse.</font>

1396
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. And what did I do to this?
What the fuck is this thing?</font>

1397
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Debbie.</font>

1398
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1399
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Fuck this.</font>

1400
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys, Gary was right.
It's awful late.</font>

1401
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get home, get to bed, huh?
Get out of his hair.</font>

1402
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:35,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't finished the game.
It's your turn, Max.</font>

1403
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my turn, huh?</font>

1404
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, be careful now, Max.
Oh!</font>

1405
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:41,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, game over. I went in a little hot.</font>

1406
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why did you...
- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.</font>

1407
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">When shall we play next?</font>

1408
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon. We'll call you.</font>

1409
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastian. Baby!</font>

1410
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, how are we supposed to get this egg
out of Donald Anderton's house?</font>

1411
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.</font>

1412
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.</font>

1413
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- We have your brother.</font>

1414
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:13,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

1415
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,</font>

1416
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're actually
on our way there right now.</font>

1417
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can do a swap, okay?
Please don't hurt Brooks.</font>

1418
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge
at midnight. If you're late, he dies.</font>

1419
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God.
- Um...</font>

1420
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, that's less than an hour from now.</font>

1421
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1422
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:32,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up with this guy's voice?
He sounds like a monster.</font>

1423
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:34,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's using a voice changer, Ryan.</font>

1424
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">He still sounds like a scary monster.</font>

1425
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:44,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we are here.</font>

1426
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. You guys head home,</font>

1427
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I will call as soon
as I get the egg, all right?</font>

1428
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Wait a second. Wait.
I'm going with you.</font>

1429
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:51,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Annie. It could be very, very
dangerous in there, okay?</font>

1430
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, Brooks shouldn't have
dragged any of us into this,</font>

1431
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he is my brother,
and it's up to me to fix it.</font>

1432
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, bullshit!
We're all in this together!</font>

1433
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Max is right.
You guys should go home,</font>

1434
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you and I are doing this.</font>

1435
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, what happens
if you guys don't make it out?</font>

1436
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:07,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't come to game night because
we're dying to play charades and shit.</font>

1437
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We come because we love you guys.</font>

1438
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, this is
the best part of our week.</font>

1439
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine, too. And I have
a lot of options on the weekend.</font>

1440
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:16,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow. You guys...</font>

1441
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. That's very nice.</font>

1442
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, good friends.</font>

1443
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should probably go, though, right?
I mean, you don't even know us.</font>

1444
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, why are you still here?</font>

1445
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.
I just got caught up in it.</font>

1446
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, if I go home now,</font>

1447
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I read in the newspaper
tomorrow that you all died,</font>

1448
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,
so I'm gonna stick around.</font>

1449
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still read the newspaper?</font>

1450
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you got from that?</font>

1451
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we gonna get into this place?</font>

1452
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go! Go! Go!</font>

1453
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1454
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like they got a party going on.
This could be good.</font>

1455
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:15,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everybody?</font>

1456
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way!</font>

1457
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.</font>

1458
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it. They are real.</font>

1459
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:51,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

1460
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!</font>

1461
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, this is some
Django Unchained bullshit.</font>

1462
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water!</font>

1463
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!</font>

1464
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rich people are fucked up!</font>

1465
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kramer, get Logan ready!</font>

1466
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.</font>

1467
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I think we should split up.</font>

1468
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And let's start upstairs.</font>

1469
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:27,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody finds the egg,
just text the others, okay?</font>

1470
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:29,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for God's sake, be careful with it.
All right?</font>

1471
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got you. I got it.</font>

1472
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:31,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be safe.</font>

1473
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you...
What are you doing?</font>

1474
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who says the egg isn't in here?</font>

1475
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:39,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I have a really good feeling
about Logan.</font>

1476
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Egg, egg, egg.
Wow! This is some bedroom.</font>

1477
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it remind you
of your celebrity boyfriend's?</font>

1478
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:46,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still on this?</font>

1479
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.
That's all I can think about.</font>

1480
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's saying a lot,</font>

1481
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club
going on downstairs.</font>

1482
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is this so important to you?</font>

1483
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:59,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because, Michelle, look,
I am losing my mind here. Okay?</font>

1484
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were broken up at the time.</font>

1485
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a hand job from Karen Waller,
so you had every right to.</font>

1486
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why not just tell me?</font>

1487
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, fine.</font>

1488
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was 10 years ago.</font>

1489
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was at a gas station,
and I noticed a guy at the next pump.</font>

1490
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Denzel Washington.</font>

1491
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold up.</font>

1492
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:27,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It actually was Denzel?</font>

1493
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1494
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was really nice.</font>

1495
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made some joke about how premium gas
is probably the same as regular.</font>

1496
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took a chance, and I asked him
if he wanted to get drinks.</font>

1497
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said yes.</font>

1498
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both got a little tipsy.</font>

1499
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offered to pay for drinks,
and he let me,</font>

1500
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I thought was pretty cool.</font>

1501
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">We danced for hours.</font>

1502
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, we ended up
back at his place,</font>

1503
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one thing led to another.</font>

1504
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just
this crazy thing that happened,</font>

1505
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, in a weird way, it made me realize</font>

1506
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only person
I ever wanna be with is you.</font>

1507
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.</font>

1508
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah. I don't believe it.</font>

1509
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, you...
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

1510
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:17,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I took a picture with him
at the club.</font>

1511
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put it in a hidden folder.</font>

1512
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Denzel and Michelle.</font>

1513
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.</font>

1514
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it is.</font>

1515
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. No, it's not.</font>

1516
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude looks a lot like Denzel,</font>

1517
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, uh, it's not him.</font>

1518
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:38,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy. That's...
Look at that, that's Denzel.</font>

1519
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let me ask you this.
Did he say he was Denzel?</font>

1520
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no.</font>

1521
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to introduce himself,
and I cut him off</font>

1522
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:48,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I told him I knew who he was.</font>

1523
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What kind of car did he drive?
- A BMW.</font>

1524
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hmm.
- Three series.</font>

1525
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:57,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. What was his place like?</font>

1526
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It... It was a two-bedroom condo.</font>

1527
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he used the, um, spare room
as an office, so...</font>

1528
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear
what you're saying right now?</font>

1529
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:10,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, let me see.</font>

1530
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you zoom in,
the nose gives it away, right?</font>

1531
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">- God damn!
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

1532
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, don't beat yourself up about it,
okay? There is some good news.</font>

1533
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:22,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,</font>

1534
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's standing right here!</font>

1535
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the real Denzel
ain't got shit on me.</font>

1536
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, how does this monster have
five kids? We don't get to have one.</font>

1537
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, his wife looks like
she's about 15.</font>

1538
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:43,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.</font>

1539
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, right. No, I know, honey.
We're just gonna...</font>

1540
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna keep plugging away
until something sticks, okay?</font>

1541
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gee, you really sound like a guy
who wants to have a kid.</font>

1542
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know, I'm just...</font>

1543
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little distracted right now,
honey, as you might imagine.</font>

1544
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you're not into this,
you kind of gotta tell me.</font>

1545
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

1546
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna have a baby,
but how do I explain this? Um...</font>

1547
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember how we used to play
Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,</font>

1548
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:11,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we could play all night?</font>

1549
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember, this one time,
I made it all the way up to level 86,</font>

1550
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:15,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and you were not too far behind, right?
- Eighty-five, but...</font>

1551
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.</font>

1552
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So anyway, what is the point?
- Mmm... Anyway,</font>

1553
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you remember
how we stayed alive so long?</font>

1554
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we did was we ate the pellets.</font>

1555
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never ate the fruit
because the fruit is how they get you.</font>

1556
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're doing a metaphor!</font>

1557
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but here's the problem.</font>

1558
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how long you and I
stayed alive in the game,</font>

1559
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">neither one of us ever made it
up to the leader board.</font>

1560
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think if we have a baby,</font>

1561
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll be officially settling down,</font>

1562
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll never make it
onto the leader board of life?</font>

1563
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's such a good metaphor.</font>

1564
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, it's not.
It's kind of bullshit.</font>

1565
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1566
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are we, 16 years old?
- No.</font>

1567
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna go backpacking
through Europe? Huh?</font>

1568
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna, like, have some wine coolers
on a football field</font>

1569
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Rebecca De Mornay?</font>

1570
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not specifically.</font>

1571
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
who's always gone for the fruit, Max?</font>

1572
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:06,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your criminal brother, and that is why
the ghosts are about to eat him!</font>

1573
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who's embracing the metaphor.</font>

1574
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:09,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so... I'm... Wow.</font>

1575
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what? All this time,
I've just been thinking</font>

1576
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">that if I helped you beat Brooks,
you would be less stressed.</font>

1577
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:20,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't wanna beat Brooks.
You wanna be Brooks.</font>

1578
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna look somewhere else.</font>

1579
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Logan! Boomer ain't shit!</font>

1580
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, ADHD!</font>

1581
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:42,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're supposed to be looking for the...</font>

1582
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit. I'm right again.</font>

1583
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:51,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, where are you going?</font>

1584
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody's watching the fight.
I'm gonna go grab it.</font>

1585
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't fucking...
- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.</font>

1586
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him!</font>

1587
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

1588
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

1589
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me?</font>

1590
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:23,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Who are you?
And what are you doing with my egg?</font>

1591
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:26,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. I was just admiring it.</font>

1592
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:30,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a bunch of these fancy-pants eggs
back at home. In my mansion.</font>

1593
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh-huh.
- This one's ugly. Hmm.</font>

1594
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does anybody know this guy?</font>

1595
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:41,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I certainly hope so.
I'm the CEO of Cyberdyne Systems.</font>

1596
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should go.</font>

1597
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boomer, take him down.</font>

1598
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone hold on a goddamn second!</font>

1599
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boomer!</font>

1600
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, any luck yet?</font>

1601
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You?</font>

1602
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it!
Let's go! Come on!</font>

1603
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

1604
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ryan! Ryan!</font>

1605
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

1606
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:20,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1607
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

1608
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1609
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michelle, I'm open! Hit me.
Hit me. Baby.</font>

1610
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:33,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh-ho-ho!
- Security!</font>

1611
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.</font>

1612
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy shit!</font>

1613
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:38,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kev, up here! Throw it!</font>

1614
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it!</font>

1615
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!</font>

1616
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no! No! No! Get away! Get away!</font>

1617
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:52,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Oh!</font>

1618
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:54,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the other side!</font>

1619
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1620
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annie! Annie, where are you?</font>

1621
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:00,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Max! Max!
- Over here! Hey!</font>

1622
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no!</font>

1623
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off me!</font>

1624
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1625
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was easy.</font>

1626
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:25,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1627
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:33,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, glass tables
are acting weird tonight.</font>

1628
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:35,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

1629
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in! Get in the van!</font>

1630
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:39,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in, get in, get in!</font>

1631
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get them! Get them!</font>

1632
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you don't wanna have a baby,
so we can do more shit like that?</font>

1633
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

1634
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the fruit
you were thinking about?</font>

1635
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:08,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-mmm.
That's not the fruit. No.</font>

1636
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:09,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, thanks for the assist.</font>

1637
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1638
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know why
I really did it.</font>

1639
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:16,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think
it's 'cause you're falling for me?</font>

1640
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:20,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1641
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:22,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not... Not sure.</font>

1642
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. I was joking.</font>

1643
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Okay. Yeah.</font>

1644
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:30,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you gonna say
you were joking, too?</font>

1645
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me to?</font>

1646
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God, you're making this weird.
- No, I'm not.</font>

1647
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:34,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.</font>

1648
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's two minutes to 12:00.
Where the hell is this bridge?</font>

1649
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">GPS says it's right around here,
but I don't see it.</font>

1650
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.</font>

1651
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:43,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

1652
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my!
- That's great.</font>

1653
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great.
Now they're gonna kill my brother.</font>

1654
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:57,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

1655
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on.</font>

1656
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not an expert,
but these gems look plastic to me.</font>

1657
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Made in China."
Is this thing not even real?</font>

1658
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe just that sticker
was made in China.</font>

1659
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's let them talk.
- Can I see?</font>

1660
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, why would the Bulgarian
ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?</font>

1661
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't think he wanted
an egg at all.</font>

1662
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he wanted
what was inside the egg.</font>

1663
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">"WITSEC." What is that?</font>

1664
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

1665
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:23,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could ask them?</font>

1666
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:43,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell anyone
we were coming here?</font>

1667
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1668
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got your egg.</font>

1669
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do?</font>

1670
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:48,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but we broke it.</font>

1671
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Well, it was a fake.</font>

1672
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have the list of names
that was inside.</font>

1673
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you wanted, right?</font>

1674
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Get on the ground.</font>

1675
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got what you want.
Can't you just let us go?</font>

1676
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, "On the ground!"</font>

1677
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, too, playboy, get over there.
Get on the ground.</font>

1678
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1679
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of that
child pose bullshit, either.</font>

1680
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:12,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,
probably you guys, too.</font>

1681
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you come here?</font>

1682
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're my brother,
and I can't just let you die,</font>

1683
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:16,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though you might deserve it.</font>

1684
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.</font>

1685
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're unbelievable, you know that?</font>

1686
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've always
been a better person than me.</font>

1687
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:25,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta shut up. Okay?</font>

1688
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.</font>

1689
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the carefree dude
that wins at everything he touches.</font>

1690
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how I win?
I cheat. I cheat at everything.</font>

1691
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I even cheated when we were kids
playing Battleship.</font>

1692
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1693
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:42,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you ever wonder why I made you
sit with your back to the TV?</font>

1694
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was so I could see your ships
in the reflection.</font>

1695
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I even took five grand
every time we played Monopoly</font>

1696
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">before we even started playing the game.</font>

1697
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cheated at the Game of Life.
And at the game of life.</font>

1698
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You son of a bitch.</font>

1699
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You son of a bitch!
- Sit down.</font>

1700
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:01,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about you, Princess?
- I don't have anything.</font>

1701
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:04,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it didn't stop there
because, when we grew up, Max,</font>

1702
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">you went off to college, and I...</font>

1703
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a career.</font>

1704
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">You married the greatest girl
in the world.</font>

1705
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I couldn't keep up
with that success.</font>

1706
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I...</font>

1707
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told everyone that I got a job
on Wall Street.</font>

1708
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I did.</font>

1709
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:23,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selling coke to traders.</font>

1710
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:26,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't invest in Panera?</font>

1711
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ate at Panera.</font>

1712
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

1713
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

1714
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's why I've been trying
to make it up to you.</font>

1715
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what this whole game night
was about.</font>

1716
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I had it rigged
so that you'd finally win.</font>

1717
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last clue was gonna lead you...</font>

1718
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your jacket pocket.</font>

1719
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:54,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

1720
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surprise!</font>

1721
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I even managed to fuck that up, though.
I'm so sorry.</font>

1722
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry, Max.</font>

1723
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're gonna be okay, though.
I got a feeling.</font>

1724
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:12,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want us to kill them all?</font>

1725
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1726
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:16,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Wait, wait. Just let us go.</font>

1727
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:17,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't tell anyone anything.</font>

1728
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got you the list!</font>

1729
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:21,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the fuck, man?
- Fuck! God damn it!</font>

1730
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, shit. The fuzz.
- Fuck, man!</font>

1731
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze!</font>

1732
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary?</font>

1733
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even think about it, pig.</font>

1734
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say I care for that nomenclature.</font>

1735
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

1736
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, bitch!</font>

1737
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfucker!</font>

1738
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

1739
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, isn't that your neighbor?</font>

1740
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did Gary get so cool?</font>

1741
01:16:57,439 --> 01:16:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1742
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody okay?</font>

1743
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.
- You all right?</font>

1744
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:03,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, thank you,</font>

1745
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">though, in sliding, my belt buckle
may have inadvertently scratched</font>

1746
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">the finish of my squad car.</font>

1747
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:10,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know we were in trouble?</font>

1748
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">The nocturnal Jenga game,</font>

1749
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:16,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,</font>

1750
01:17:16,359 --> 01:17:19,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Max's curious search history
piqued my interest.</font>

1751
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:22,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right. Oh, God.
- You, uh...</font>

1752
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved our lives.</font>

1753
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:25,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1754
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:27,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just doing my job.</font>

1755
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:30,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God!
- Oh!</font>

1756
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:32,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shit!
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</font>

1757
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary!</font>

1758
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello? I need an ambulance.
Officer down.</font>

1759
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, shit!
- Hang in there, pal.</font>

1760
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:40,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. Hang on, pal.</font>

1761
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. You're gonna be all right.</font>

1762
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:43,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get you to a hospital.</font>

1763
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:44,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, look at me. Gary, look.</font>

1764
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have got a lot to live for, okay?</font>

1765
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I?</font>

1766
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

1767
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no wife.</font>

1768
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No friends.
- That's not true.</font>

1769
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't say that.</font>

1770
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:57,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got us. We're your friends.
- You've got us.</font>

1771
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even like
spending time with me.</font>

1772
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we do. We just...</font>

1773
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been a little selfish. That's all.</font>

1774
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, right.
- You know, I'm sorry about that.</font>

1775
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:08,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Oh, God.</font>

1776
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bastian.
- Huh?</font>

1777
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone please take care of Bastian.</font>

1778
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:17,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian
yourself, okay?</font>

1779
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, soon as you get out
of the hospital,</font>

1780
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna come to every single
game night we have.</font>

1781
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't...</font>

1782
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1783
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you ever</font>

1784
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">exclude me again.</font>

1785
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never exclude you again, pal.
- No.</font>

1786
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:38,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, God. What is that?
- What's that?</font>

1787
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a blood clot?</font>

1788
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:43,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a blood capsule.</font>

1789
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh?
- A blood capsule?</font>

1790
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:49,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is how
you do a game night.</font>

1791
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1792
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've duped you all.</font>

1793
01:18:58,479 --> 01:18:59,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha...</font>

1794
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:03,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second. Are you telling me
that this whole thing was a game?</font>

1795
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? What?
- Damn!</font>

1796
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1797
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.</font>

1798
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I learned you stopped inviting me
to your game nights,</font>

1799
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hijacked
Brooks's murder mystery party,</font>

1800
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I staged a kidnapping of my own.</font>

1801
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta be kidding me.</font>

1802
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:22,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">What better way to prove my worth
as a game night participant?</font>

1803
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:24,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what about these dudes?
Are they actors?</font>

1804
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. They're... They're felons.</font>

1805
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Felons?</font>

1806
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was able to shave some time off
of their parole</font>

1807
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:31,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">in exchange
for this little side project.</font>

1808
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We square now?</font>

1809
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, gentlemen.</font>

1810
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">That lady hit me with the car.</font>

1811
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what the hell kind of psycho
are you?</font>

1812
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:39,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put us through all this,
just for your own amusement?</font>

1813
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Just the opposite.
For your amusement.</font>

1814
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did everyone have fun?</font>

1815
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No! No.
- Yeah. No.</font>

1816
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fun! I got shot!</font>

1817
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">By me!</font>

1818
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see how that's possible.
My men were using blanks.</font>

1819
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:53,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was my gun.
It was a real gun.</font>

1820
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:56,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,</font>

1821
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Bulgarian, that was you?</font>

1822
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:01,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've lost me.</font>

1823
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The egg, the WITSEC list?</font>

1824
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all you. All part of your game?</font>

1825
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:11,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a list of people in
the Federal Witness Protection program.</font>

1826
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get this?</font>

1827
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">From inside the egg.
Stop fucking with us. It's over!</font>

1828
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:18,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not fudging with you.
I honestly have no idea what...</font>

1829
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy. Yikes!</font>

1830
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, how stupid do you think we are?
- Hey, Max.</font>

1831
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:27,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gang, are we looking
at the big twist here?</font>

1832
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gets shot again!</font>

1833
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by who? A couple of new characters
you introduce at the last minute.</font>

1834
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, you've jumped the shark!</font>

1835
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you go to the magic shop</font>

1836
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to buy a bunch of these little bullets?
- No.</font>

1837
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:40,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

1838
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Officer Kingsbury.
We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.</font>

1839
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one of you is Brooks Davis?</font>

1840
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's funny.
You don't look like an asshole.</font>

1841
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I look like an asshole to you?</font>

1842
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1843
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of us has to be the asshole
in this transaction</font>

1844
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:03,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">because otherwise I'd have my egg,
and you'd have your money.</font>

1845
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">But instead, we've wasted our night
tracking you down.</font>

1846
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we're gonna have to kill you.</font>

1847
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? No, no, no, no.
- What?</font>

1848
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?</font>

1849
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:17,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, I'm Max.
I'm Brooks's brother.</font>

1850
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, you know, look. He screwed up.</font>

1851
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:20,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right? You got greedy.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1852
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">He admits it.</font>

1853
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good news is, though,
that we got your egg.</font>

1854
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is broken. Uh, my screw up.</font>

1855
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, um, I got the list.</font>

1856
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:30,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">which I bet you've been after
this whole time.</font>

1857
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:32,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about this?</font>

1858
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:34,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about</font>

1859
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">you take this list for free,
and we all go our separate ways?</font>

1860
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody gets hurt.</font>

1861
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, except the poor folks on this list,
I'm guessing.</font>

1862
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1863
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

1864
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal. Makes perfect sense.</font>

1865
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. You give him that list,
he's gonna kill me.</font>

1866
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nonsense.</font>

1867
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is wrong with you?</font>

1868
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:02,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to buy myself some time.</font>

1869
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:05,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much. We're just gonna
cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.</font>

1870
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!</font>

1871
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not worried about that.</font>

1872
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:17,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just letting them go?</font>

1873
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.</font>

1874
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:22,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only this one.</font>

1875
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:23,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- Don't follow us!</font>

1876
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gary! He's breathing.</font>

1877
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:29,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the only private air terminal
around here is at Conway.</font>

1878
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:30,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. How are we gonna get there?</font>

1879
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:32,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks's house is
not that far from here.</font>

1880
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our car's not there.</font>

1881
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:36,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it is.</font>

1882
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you don't have to do this
because I can just poop it out.</font>

1883
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna go digging
through your feces. That's disgusting!</font>

1884
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:55,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hold still
while I cut your stomach open.</font>

1885
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:56,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no! No! Whoa!</font>

1886
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

1887
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that...
- That's my brother.</font>

1888
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get us in the air.</font>

1889
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

1890
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hold on!
- Oh!</font>

1891
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- Yeah, you?</font>

1892
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:24,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yup, good.
- Okay.</font>

1893
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:30,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay. What's our plan?</font>

1894
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have one idea.</font>

1895
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's so crazy, though, baby,
it just might work.</font>

1896
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna
crash the car into the plane,</font>

1897
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?</font>

1898
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did that in Taken 3, huh?</font>

1899
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, are you ready? Here we go!
- Uh-huh.</font>

1900
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1901
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you missed it.</font>

1902
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:55,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, baby.</font>

1903
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks, we're coming!</font>

1904
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

1905
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:24,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, at least I got
to drive it for 10 minutes.</font>

1906
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1907
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have to hide.
- Yeah.</font>

1908
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:30,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Go.</font>

1909
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!</font>

1910
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:35,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go! It's stuck.</font>

1911
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

1912
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!</font>

1913
01:24:58,319 --> 01:24:59,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you at, lady?</font>

1914
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you little bitch.</font>

1915
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're back here somewhere.</font>

1916
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's end this shit.
I won't kill you. Come out!</font>

1917
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, get your ass out here!</font>

1918
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn on the belt!</font>

1919
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1920
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:15,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Look at the box!</font>

1921
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's talk!
- Can you charade it to me?</font>

1922
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charades?</font>

1923
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's some cute full-circle bullshit.</font>

1924
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go. Three words.</font>

1925
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, lady.</font>

1926
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you?</font>

1927
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:30,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn.</font>

1928
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:31,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn, turn, turn. Turn.</font>

1929
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:33,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">On.</font>

1930
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:36,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn on. Turn on what? Turn on what?</font>

1931
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn on belt?</font>

1932
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn on belt!</font>

1933
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:53,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boy, that's a slow belt.</font>

1934
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1935
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:08,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God! Annie!</font>

1936
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:12,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, boy, that was...</font>

1937
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:14,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what I was going for,
though, right?</font>

1938
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:15,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah.</font>

1939
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then did you see when I hit him
with the fire extinguisher?</font>

1940
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I sure did. I sure did, yeah.
- That was cool, right? Yeah.</font>

1941
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:21,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Great.</font>

1942
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want this?</font>

1943
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:24,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't want you to have it,
Calamity Jane.</font>

1944
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look.</font>

1945
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I saw a hatch
at the top of the plane.</font>

1946
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I can get the drop on him.</font>

1947
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "The drop"?
- Yup, yeah.</font>

1948
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:32,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

1949
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go use
the emergency phone? Call for help.</font>

1950
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:34,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna do the drop.</font>

1951
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!</font>

1952
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:38,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That hurts my feelings!
- I'm sorry!</font>

1953
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough of this shit.</font>

1954
01:27:10,279 --> 01:27:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Max!</font>

1955
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get the drop on anyone tonight.</font>

1956
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:15,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put that little knife down!</font>

1957
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:17,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now! That's it.</font>

1958
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

1959
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right in my bullet hole.</font>

1960
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:28,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

1961
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1962
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

1963
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it!</font>

1964
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:44,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait. Um...</font>

1965
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:47,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.
I have kids at home.</font>

1966
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not with that ass you don't.</font>

1967
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1968
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you.</font>

1969
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

1970
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1971
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

1972
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, he died!</font>

1973
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's how
you get the drop on someone!</font>

1974
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:40,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

1975
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh!</font>

1976
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:44,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I got you! I got you!
- This is high.</font>

1977
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're amazing.</font>

1978
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can cut me loose now.
- Thank you!</font>

1979
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Okay, okay.</font>

1980
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:52,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh...
- Yeah. In the bag.</font>

1981
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This? Okay.
- Look in the bag. That's right.</font>

1982
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1983
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Thank you!</font>

1984
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</font>

1985
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

1986
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look at that.</font>

1987
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:06,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put a bungee cord in your hand,</font>

1988
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go straight to the pervy place,
don't you?</font>

1989
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:09,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1990
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:11,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved my life. Thank you.</font>

1991
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

1992
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:15,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I just saw a man die,
but I'm... I'm okay.</font>

1993
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a knife in your bullet hole?</font>

1994
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.</font>

1995
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:22,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, what?</font>

1996
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:23,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to think that
I wanted Brooks' life,</font>

1997
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, you know, turns out he was just...</font>

1998
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:26,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a loser. He's a loser.</font>

1999
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:28,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, guilty.</font>

2000
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:29,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">But us making a family?</font>

2001
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's... That's not pellets.
That's the fruit.</font>

2002
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:34,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fruit. It's fruit.</font>

2003
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. What's going on?</font>

2004
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:38,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus, think about all the dumdums
that have kids, right?</font>

2005
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">And think about how much better
our kid is gonna be than their kids.</font>

2006
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna beat their kids
at everything.</font>

2007
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:44,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's taken you this long to see that?</font>

2008
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our baby is gonna crush
every other baby.</font>

2009
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:49,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. That's right.
And not in that "peak too early,"</font>

2010
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:50,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know, "kid actor" kind of way,
you know?</font>

2011
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:51,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-mmm. No.</font>

2012
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:53,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will parcel out
his or her gifts over time.</font>

2013
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Absolutely.
- Yes.</font>

2014
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.</font>

2015
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause China's the future.</font>

2016
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It sure is.
- Yeah.</font>

2017
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:00,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the future.
- Oh, my God.</font>

2018
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

2019
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:08,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that concludes my game night.</font>

2020
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:10,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

2021
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">It went exactly as I planned.</font>

2022
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">You learned every lesson
that I wanted you to.</font>

2023
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trevor, you can get up now.</font>

2024
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just fucking with you, but that
would've been really cool, right?</font>

2025
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such a dick.</font>

2026
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!</font>

2027
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:40,672

2028
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on. Hey, thanks
for letting me host again, huh?</font>

2029
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not like we had a choice.</font>

2030
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only 36 months to go.</font>

2031
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, time will fly.</font>

2032
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, yeah.</font>

2033
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:51,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on!
- Hey, listen, Brooks.</font>

2034
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're probably feeling
pretty humbled by all of this.</font>

2035
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:58,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, honestly, I think you're gonna come
out the other side a much better man.</font>

2036
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! Hey, look.</font>

2037
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I completely agree.</font>

2038
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:03,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember the WITSEC list
I swallowed?</font>

2039
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure.
- I pooped it out,</font>

2040
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">sold it for $3 million
on the black market.</font>

2041
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:09,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you serious?
- Pretty sweet, huh?</font>

2042
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brooks, everybody on that list
is gonna get killed.</font>

2043
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.</font>

2044
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:16,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tipped everyone off
that they were in danger.</font>

2045
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">For $20,000 apiece.</font>

2046
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're unbelievable.</font>

2047
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:23,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. It's not like
I'm gonna live in this dump forever.</font>

2048
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as this cuff comes off,
I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.</font>

2049
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:27,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm moving in with Johanna.</font>

2050
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:29,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she is.</font>

2051
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:30,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dr. Chin!</font>

2052
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,038

<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, The Crying Game?</font>

2055
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Boys Don't Cry?</font>

2056
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?</font>

2057
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:40,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Potato Head.

01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is me at the Regal Cinema crying</font>

2063

<font color="#FFFFFF">as I did through much of the film.</font>

2064
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">How were we supposed to know that, Gary?</font>

2065
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume everyone cried
during The Green Mile.</font>

2066
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, who's next?</font>

2067
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go.</font>

2068

01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

2072
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a rock.
- A bean? A rock!</font>

2073
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:09,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A ball?
- That's a...</font>

01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Burger. Is that a burger?
- Football! Football!</font>

2075
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:12,775

that's a dinner roll, right?</font>

2076
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A bun!

01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:19,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this a motion picture?
- Bun is in a house. On a train.</font>

2080
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:20,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you supposed
to announce it?</font>

2081
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:22,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Microwave?
- It's being cooked. It's in an oven.</font>

2082
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:23,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bun in the oven!
- Yes, yes, yes!</font>

2083
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. What?</font>

They're having a baby!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice to meet you, Kenny.</font>

2092
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:43,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually people cut me off
and say they know who I am.</font>

2093
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:46,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah?
