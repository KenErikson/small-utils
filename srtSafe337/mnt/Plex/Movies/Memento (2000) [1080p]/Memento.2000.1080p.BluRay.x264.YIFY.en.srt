14
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you? I must have forgot.</font>

15
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,180

you about my condition.</font>

16

19
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,490

20
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just trying to have
a little fun.</font>

21
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll up your window.</font>

22
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.</font>

23
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.</font>

24
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell you
wanna go there for?</font>

25
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know it?
- Yeah. It's just this fucked-up building.</font>

26
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,730

- Don't remember.</font>

27

- That thing's been here for years.</font>

tracks are only a few days old.</font>

29

Pocahontas?</font>

30
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

31
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,530

Kill him."</font>

34
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finally found him. How
long have I been looking?</font>

35
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find anything?</font>

36
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't think so.</font>

37
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

38
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck this.</font>

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna pay
for what you did.</font>

40
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
- Leonard.</font>

41
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have
a clue, you freak.</font>

42
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.</font>

43
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, you don't
know what's going on.</font>

44
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.</font>

45
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 'cause you read it
off a fucking picture.</font>

46
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know who you are.</font>

47
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm
from San Francisco.</font>

48
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.</font>

49
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?</font>

50
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

51
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Let's go
down to the basement.</font>

52
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go down, you
and me, together.</font>

53
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you'll know
who you really are.</font>

54
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

55
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,670
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's just an anonymous room.</i></font>

56
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.</i></font>

57
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I, of course, read religiously.</i></font>

58
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,350
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You know who you are, and you
know kind of all about yourself.</i></font>

59
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.</i></font>

60
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,810
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sammy Jankis had
the same problem...</i></font>

61
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but he really had no system.</i></font>

62
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He wrote himself a ridiculous
amount of notes...</i></font>

63
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but he'd get them all mixed up.</i></font>

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,660
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You really do need a system
if you're gonna make it work.</i></font>

65
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

66
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?</font>

67
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burt.</font>

68
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may
have asked you to hold my calls.</font>

69
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?</font>

70
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, I think I may have.
I'm not good on the phone.</font>

71
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.</font>

72
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

73
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't remember saying that?</font>

74
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's the thing.
I have this condition.</font>

75
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">A condition?</font>

76
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my memory.
- Amnesia?</font>

77
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. It's different from that.
I have no short-term memory.</font>

78
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who I am. I know
all about myself. I just...</font>

79
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since my injury, I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.</font>

80
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started.</font>

81
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time I see you, I'm not gonna
remember this conversation.</font>

82
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
if I've met you before.</font>

83
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if I seem a little strange
or rude or something...</font>

84
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've told you this
before, haven't I?</font>

85
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I don't mean to mess
with you, but it's so weird.</font>

86
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't remember me at all?
- No.</font>

87
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.</font>

88
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the last
thing you remember?</font>

89
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife.</font>

90
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it like?</font>

91
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like waking.
It's like you just woke up.</font>

92
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That must suck.</font>

93
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all backwards, I mean...</font>

94
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you get an idea
about what you want to do next,</font>

95
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't remember
what you just did.</font>

96
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?</font>

97
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?</font>

98
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like you said.
- Okay, but this guy's an exception.</font>

99
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know this guy?
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?</font>

100
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
he's my friend?</font>

101
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.</font>

102
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- If he calls or if he shows up here...</font>

103
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">give me a call in my room, okay?</font>

104
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name's Teddy?</font>

105
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.</font>

106
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I hope my condition's not
gonna be a problem for you.</font>

107
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not as long as you
remember to pay the bill.</font>

108
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Okay.</font>

109
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forty.
- Forty.</font>

110
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy...</font>

111
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,050

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there.
I'll be right over.</i></font>

146
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I'll be waiting.</font>

147
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">"White. Male."</font>

148
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">"First name John."</font>

149
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Last name: G" for Gammell.</font>

150
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,130

151
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">"SG 13...</font>

152
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">7I U."</font>

153
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him.</font>

154
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found you, you fuck.</font>

155
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.</font>

156
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but it's not amnesia. I remember
everything up until my injury.</font>

157
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't make new memories. So
I can't remember talking to you.</font>

158
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.</font>

159
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.</font>

160
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.</font>

161
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy wrote himself endless amounts
of notes, but he got mixed up.</font>

162
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.</font>

163
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm disciplined and organized.</font>

164
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.</font>

165
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy had no drive, no
reason to make it work.</font>

166
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? Yeah, I got a reason.</font>

167
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet
Natalie for info.</font>

168
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has also lost someone.</font>

169
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will help you out of pity."</font>

170
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.</font>

171
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I should have explained.
I have this...</font>

172
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did explain, Lenny.</font>

173
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.</font>

174
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know. You told me.</font>

175
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I probably told you
how much I hated it.</font>

176
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

177
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...</font>

178
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. So you have
information for me?</font>

179
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.</font>

180
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be tough living your life according
to a couple of scraps of paper.</font>

181
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list...</font>

182
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll end up eating
your underwear for breakfast.</font>

183
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that's why you
have those freaky tattoos.</font>

184
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's tough.
It's almost impossible.</font>

185
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.</font>

186
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do have information for you.</font>

187
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave me a license
plate number.</font>

188
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had my friend at DMV trace it.</font>

189
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess what name came up.</font>

190
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">John Edward Gammell. John G.</font>

191
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know him?
- No.</font>

192
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.</font>

193
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's been in the bar,
maybe.</font>

194
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.</font>

195
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you want this?</font>

196
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.</font>

197
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you shouldn't have to ask.</font>

198
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.</font>

199
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not even gonna
know that it happened.</font>

200
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make
any difference whether I know about it.</font>

201
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because there
are things I don't remember</font>

202
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't make my actions
meaningless.</font>

203
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?</font>

204
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, maybe I'll take
a photograph to remind myself...</font>

205
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">get another freaky tattoo.</font>

206
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about her again.</font>

207
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

208
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you
like to remember her.</font>

209
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was beautiful.</font>

210
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To me, she was perfect.
- No. Don't just recite the words.</font>

211
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes...
and remember her.</font>

212
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can just feel the details.</font>

213
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bits and pieces you never
bothered to put into words.</font>

214
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can feel these
extreme moments...</font>

215
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>even if you don't want to.</i></font>

216
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,830
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You put these together, and you
get the feel of a person.</i></font>

217
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to know how much
you miss them...</font>

218
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and how much you hate
the person who took them away.</i></font>

219
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I added an address in here.</font>

220
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might be useful. It's an abandoned
place outside of town.</font>

221
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guy I knew used to do
bigger deals there.</font>

222
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's isolated.</font>

223
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds perfect.</font>

224
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.</font>

225
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

226
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, you have this condition.</font>

227
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still staying at the Discount
Inn, room 304? You left it at my place.</font>

228
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

229
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.</font>

230
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what we have in common?</font>

231
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are both survivors.</font>

232
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take care, Leonard.</font>

233
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Remember Sammy Jankis."</font>

234
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.</font>

235
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.</font>

236
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to see
through people's bullshit.</font>

237
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.</font>

238
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I meet someone, I don't
know if I've met them before.</font>

239
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.</font>

240
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,724
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My job taught me
the best way to find out</i></font>

241
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:39,484
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>what someone knew
was just let them talk...</i></font>

242
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,820
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and watch the eyes
and the body language.</i></font>

243
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,025
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If someone scratches their nose
while they're talking,</i></font>

244
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,914
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>experts tell you it
means they're lying.</i></font>

245
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i></font>

246
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's all about context.</i></font>

247
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was good.</font>

248
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy was my first
real challenge.</font>

249
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Lenny! I thought
you split for good.</font>

250
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Things change.
- So I see.</font>

251
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.</font>

252
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only every time I see you.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.</font>

253
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Yeah.</font>

254
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of hearing about the guy. What
about John G.? You think he's still here?</font>

255
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.</font>

256
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that's why you haven't
left town, am I right?</font>

257
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

258
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, look. You have
to be very careful.</font>

259
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:36,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

260
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up...</font>

261
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">get you to kill the wrong guy.</font>

262
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, I go on facts, not
recommendations, but thank you.</font>

263
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.</font>

264
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.</font>

265
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please!</font>

266
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It's not even that good.</font>

267
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask the police. Eyewitness
testimony is unreliable.</font>

268
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.</font>

269
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">They collect facts, they make
notes, and they draw conclusions.</font>

270
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facts, not memories.</font>

271
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how you investigate. I know.
It's what I used to do.</font>

272
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.</font>

273
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">And memories can be distorted.</font>

274
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just an interpretation.
They're not a record.</font>

275
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're irrelevant
if you have the facts.</font>

276
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really want to get
this guy, don't you?</font>

277
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed my wife. He took
away my fucking memory.</font>

278
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">He destroyed my ability to live.</font>

279
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're living.</font>

280
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only for revenge.</font>

281
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?</font>

282
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Discount Inn.</font>

283
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.</font>

284
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably left it in your room.</font>

285
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi. I'm checked in here,
but I think I've misplaced my key.</font>

286
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?</font>

287
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't see my key anywhere.
- Shit.</font>

288
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the wrong room.
You're in 304 now.</font>

289
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry. I fucked up.
- This is not my room?</font>

290
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Let's go.</font>

291
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is this my handwriting?</font>

292
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was your room,
but now you're in 304.</font>

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When was I in here?
- Last week.</font>

294
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I rented you
another room on top of it.</font>

295
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Business is slow.</font>

296
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told my boss
about your condition and stuff...</font>

297
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he said, "Try and rent
him another room."</font>

298
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?</font>

299
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just two, so far.</font>

300
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least you're being honest
about ripping me off.</font>

301
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna
remember anyway.</font>

302
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to be
that honest, Burt.</font>

303
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, always get a receipt.</font>

304
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.</font>

305
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What time is it?
- Quarter to 1:00.</font>

306
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your room's...</font>

307
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.</font>

308
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.</font>

309
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Samuel R. Jankis.
Strangest case ever.</font>

310
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the guy's a 58-year-old
semiretired accountant.</font>

311
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and his wife had been in this
car accident. Nothing too serious.</font>

312
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,520
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But he's acting funny. He can't
get a handle on what's going on.</i></font>

313
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The doctors find some possible
damage to the hippocampus.</i></font>

314
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,561
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nothing conclusive,
but Sammy can't remember</i></font>

315
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,434
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>anything for more
than a couple of minutes.</i></font>

316
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.</i></font>

317
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,040
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>His wife calls the insurance
company, and I get sent in.</i></font>

318
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now, this is my first big claims
investigation, so I really check into it.</i></font>

319
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sammy can think just fine,
but he can't make any new memories.</i></font>

320
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i></font>

321
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is Mr. Shelby.
- <i>He'd watch TV...</i></font>

322
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but anything longer than a couple
of minutes was too confusing.</i></font>

323
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He couldn't remember how it began. He
liked commercials. They were short.</i></font>

324
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy. It's time for my shot.</font>

325
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,980
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The crazy part
was that this guy...</i></font>

326
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>who couldn't even follow the plot
of</i> Green Acres <i>anymore...</i></font>

327
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,440
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>could do the most complicated
things...</i></font>

328
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,910
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>as long as he learned them
before the accident...</i></font>

329
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and as long as he kept
his mind on what he was doing.</i></font>

330
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be gentle.</font>

331
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,710
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The doctors assure me there's a real
condition called anterograde memory loss...</i></font>

332
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>or short-term memory loss.</i></font>

333
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,840
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's rare, but legit.</i></font>

334
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,590
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But every time I see him...</i></font>

335
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,340
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I catch this look...</i></font>

336
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,010
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>this slight look of recognition.</i></font>

337
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But he says he can't
remember me at all.</i></font>

338
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy, it's okay. I got it.
I got it.</font>

339
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.</font>

340
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,110
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now... I can read people,
and I'm thinking: Bad actor.</i></font>

341
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now I'm suspicious,
and I order more tests.</font>

342
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awake.</font>

343
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

344
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody's bedroom.</font>

345
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be her room.</font>

346
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who is she?</font>

347
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only me.</font>

348
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?</font>

349
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, shit.
I gotta be someplace.</font>

350
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's pretty weird.
- It's useful.</font>

351
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never write a phone
number on your hand?</font>

352
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate.</font>

353
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G.'s license plate.</font>

354
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have it tattooed
on your thigh.</font>

355
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Natalie."</font>

356
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She has also lost someone.</font>

357
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will help you out of pity."</font>

358
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's registered
in this state...</font>

359
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.</font>

360
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call you as soon
as I talk to him.</font>

361
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think we could just
arrange a meeting now?</font>

362
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:20,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not too good on the phone.</font>

363
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's great that you...</font>

364
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you're helping
me like this.</font>

365
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm helping you
because you helped me.</font>

366
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">So next time you see me,
will you remember me?</font>

367
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you will.</font>

368
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

369
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny, before you go, could
I have my shirt back, please?</font>

370
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, Lenny! I thought
you split for good.</font>

371
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy couldn't pick
up any new skills at all.</font>

372
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I find something
in my research: Conditioning.</font>

373
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy should still be able
to learn through repetition.</font>

374
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's how you learn stuff
like riding a bike.</font>

375
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just get better
through practice.</font>

376
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a completely different part
of the brain from the short-term memory.</font>

377
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.</font>

378
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pick up any three objects.</font>

379
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a test?</font>

380
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were you guys
when I did my CPA?</font>

381
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

382
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! What the fuck?</font>

383
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.</font>

384
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Some of the objects
were electrified.</i></font>

385
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,220
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test...</i></font>

386
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">always with the same
objects electrified.</font>

387
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects...</font>

388
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">not by memory, but by instinct.</font>

389
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie, right? Who
the fuck is Dodd?</font>

390
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess I don't have
to worry about him anymore.</font>

391
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:05,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck have
you got me into?</font>

392
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come inside.</font>

393
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is he?
- Calm down. Okay?</font>

394
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my problem. You offered to help. It
has nothing to do with your investigation.</font>

395
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get me into this?</font>

396
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You offered to help when you
saw what he did to my face.</font>

397
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know he did
that to your face?</font>

398
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:24,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I came straight
to you after he did it.</font>

399
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I showed you what he did,
and I asked you to help me.</font>

400
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I just take your word?
- Yeah.</font>

401
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something doesn't feel right.</font>

402
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.</font>

403
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you?
- What?</font>

404
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill him?
- Of course not!</font>

405
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

406
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, okay? Sit.</font>

407
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has nothing to do with you.</font>

408
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You helped me out,
and I'm grateful.</font>

409
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to burn them.</font>

410
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.</font>

411
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust your own judgment. You
can question everything.</font>

412
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.</font>

413
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such as?</font>

414
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what that's gonna sound
like when I knock on it.</font>

415
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what that's gonna
feel like when I pick it up.</font>

416
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? Certainties. It's the kind
of memory you take for granted.</font>

417
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I can
remember so much.</font>

418
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The feel of the world...
and her.</font>

419
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gone.</font>

420
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the present is trivia,
which I scribble down as fucking notes!</font>

421
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Come on. Try and relax.
Come on.</font>

422
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not easy for me
to relax, you know?</font>

423
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Take your jacket off.</font>

424
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. Come on.</font>

425
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

426
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't think you were the type.</font>

427
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's backwards.</font>

428
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

429
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

430
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about here?</font>

431
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's for when I find him.</font>

432
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've lost somebody too.</font>

433
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

434
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name was Jimmy.</font>

435
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.</font>

436
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never came back.</font>

437
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.</font>

438
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do the police think?</font>

439
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.</font>

440
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you find this
guy, this John G...</font>

441
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">what are you gonna do?</font>

442
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna kill him.</font>

443
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I can help you find him.</font>

444
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
how long she's been gone.</font>

445
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...</font>

446
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she's gone
to the bathroom or something.</font>

447
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">But somehow I just...</font>

448
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just know she's never
gonna come back to bed.</font>

449
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could just reach over and touch
her side of the bed...</font>

450
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would know that it was cold.</font>

451
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't.</font>

452
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I can't have her back.</font>

453
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.</font>

454
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.</font>

455
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I heal?</font>

456
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">How am I supposed to heal if I can't...
feel time?</font>

457
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She has also lost someone.</font>

458
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">She will help you out of pity."</font>

459
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">They kept testing
Sammy for months...</font>

460
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.</font>

461
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! What the fuck?</font>

462
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!</font>

463
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even with total
short-term memory loss...</font>

464
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,660
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively
stop picking up the wrong objects.</i></font>

465
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,981
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All the previous cases
responded to conditioning.</i></font>

466
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:47,814
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sammy
didn't respond at all.</i></font>

467
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,460
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.</i></font>

468
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.</font>

469
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.</font>

470
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conditioning didn't work
for Sammy, so he became helpless.</font>

471
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it works for me.</font>

472
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I live the way Sammy couldn't.</font>

473
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Habit and routine make
my life possible.</font>

474
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conditioning.
Acting on instinct.</font>

475
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awake.</font>

476
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

477
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motel room.</font>

478
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some anonymous motel room.</font>

479
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing in the drawers,
but I'll take a look anyway.</font>

480
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing except the Gideon Bible.</font>

481
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny! Open up!</font>

482
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a minute.</font>

483
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door.</font>

484
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny.</font>

485
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door.</font>

486
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

487
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Teddy.</font>

488
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finished playing
with yourself, Lenny?</font>

489
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it.</font>

490
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amorous neighbors.</font>

491
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

492
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called me. You said
you needed my help.</font>

493
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had more rewarding
friendships than this one.</font>

494
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.</font>

495
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is that?</font>

496
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who the fuck is that?
- You don't know him?</font>

497
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Should I?</font>

498
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

499
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that John G.?
- I don't think so.</font>

500
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think so? You
didn't write it down?</font>

501
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:18,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might've fallen
asleep before I did.</font>

502
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Christ's sakes!</font>

503
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask him.</font>

504
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

505
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name.</font>

506
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?</font>

507
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Who did this to you?</font>

508
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did.</font>

509
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm not gonna
help you kill that guy.</font>

510
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:43,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, just let me
think for a minute.</font>

511
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?</font>

512
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Natalie who?
- Why?</font>

513
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe I know her.
- Look. We gotta get him out of here.</font>

514
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right.</font>

515
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gotta have a car, right?</font>

516
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we take him down to his car,
we come to get the fuck out of town</font>

517
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we're gonna kill him.</font>

518
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.</font>

519
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know.</font>

520
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know.</font>

521
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do. This is not my room.</font>

522
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be his room.
Great! Let's go.</font>

523
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?</font>

524
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him,</font>

525
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">call the cops. He can ID us.</font>

526
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. We untie him...</font>

527
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">we clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.</font>

528
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gun. Why would I have a gun?</font>

529
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.</font>

530
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking hope not.</font>

531
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one?</font>

532
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.</font>

533
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up.</font>

534
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that's all right for you to say.
You're the one with the Jag.</font>

535
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in. I'm gonna ride with him.
You follow us.</font>

536
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your keys.</font>

537
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your own car.</font>

538
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">So was he scared?</font>

539
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I think it
was your sinister mustache.</font>

540
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you. You should
have stolen his car.</font>

541
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?</font>

542
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you do now?</font>

543
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to find out what the fuck
that was all about.</font>

544
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natalie, right? Who
the fuck is Dodd?</font>

545
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him...</font>

546
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">and fighting
the company's decision.</font>

547
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it wasn't the money
that got to her.</font>

548
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>
- Listen. I have an idea.</font>

549
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy, I have an idea.</font>

550
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,160
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just that his problem
was mental, not physical.</i></font>

551
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to have a pen
in your pocket, okay?</font>

552
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>But she couldn't understand.</i>
- You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.</font>

553
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!</font>

554
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try harder.</font>

555
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,630
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person.</i></font>

556
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If it's not a physical problem,
he should just snap out of it.</i></font>

557
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?</font>

558
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!</font>

559
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!</font>

560
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">So good old Leonard Shelby
from the insurance company</font>

561
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">gives her the seed of doubt...</font>

562
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,160

it to the doctors.</font>

563
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.</font>

564
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't feel drunk.</font>

565
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- Shit.</font>

566
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,580

get rid of him for Natalie."</font>

You know what to do.</i></font>

574
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. This is a message
for Teddy.</font>

575
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm at the MountCrest Inn
of Fifth Street, room six.</font>

576
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to come over as soon
as you get this. It's important.</font>

577
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.</font>

578
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

579
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Mrs. Jankis didn't
understand was that</font>

580
00:49:00,443 --> 00:49:02,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't bully someone
into remembering.</font>

581
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more pressure you're
under, the harder it gets.</font>

582
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then call me back?</font>

583
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. So what am I doing?</font>

584
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm chasing this guy.</font>

585
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He's chasing me.</font>

586
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

587
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Dodd. White guy.</font>

588
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."</font>

589
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get the jump
on you, you fucker.</font>

590
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

591
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

592
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a weapon.</font>

593
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">This'll do.</font>

594
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't feel drunk.</font>

595
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I know this guy?</font>

596
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">He seems to know me.</font>

597
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

598
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I like your car.
- Thank you.</font>

599
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?</font>

600
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't made a strong
enough impression on you?</font>

601
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be too
hard on yourself.</font>

602
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. What am I doing?</font>

603
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this?</font>

604
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouch. Cut it out.</font>

605
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How can you read that again?
- It's good.</font>

606
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you've read it,
like, a thousand times.</font>

607
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I enjoy it.</font>

608
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.</font>

609
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be a prick.</font>

610
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not reading it to annoy you.
I enjoy it.</font>

611
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let me read, please.</font>

612
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably tried this before.</font>

613
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably burned
truckloads of your stuff.</font>

614
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't remember to forget you.</font>

615
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

616
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

617
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.</font>

618
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hoping for a little more
on the drugs angle. Can you hang on a sec?</font>

619
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.</font>

620
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.</font>

621
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.</font>

622
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dealt with the police
a lot in my insurance job.</font>

623
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">With my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.</font>

624
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.</font>

625
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I've been trying
to log them all.</font>

626
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why these
are crossed out.</font>

627
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they weren't
even looking for John G.</font>

628
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stuff they found in the car fit
in with what they believed had happened...</font>

629
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they didn't chase
any of it up.</font>

630
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey.</font>

631
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, it's late.</font>

632
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything okay?</font>

633
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay in there?</font>

634
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it good for you?</font>

635
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Was I supposed
to lock the door?</font>

636
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

637
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like you to leave now.</font>

638
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn't ring true for me.</font>

639
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the police claim
the guy was an addict...</font>

640
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit...</font>

641
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause he's not gonna
go breaking into places</font>

642
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:43,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">while he's still got
a stash that big.</font>

643
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think John G. left it
there or planted it there.</font>

644
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

645
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit. That's true. It fits.</font>

646
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's a dealer.</font>

647
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on a sec.</font>

648
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we're getting somewhere.</font>

649
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Discount Inn."</font>

650
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.</font>

651
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what they say.</font>

652
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Discount Inn. 304.</font>

653
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard.</font>

654
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what then?</font>

655
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just go to bed. You wait
for me to fall asleep.</font>

656
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go into the bathroom
and you slam the door.</font>

657
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.</font>

658
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And that's it?
- That's it.</font>

659
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">First I just need you to put
these things around the room.</font>

660
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pretend they're your things
and that this is your bedroom.</font>

661
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should I wear it?
- No, no. No.</font>

662
01:01:57,091 --> 01:02:00,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, just like you
took it off or something.</font>

663
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you to use it.
I'm sorry.</font>

664
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just mean put them
around the room...</font>

665
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if they were your things.</font>

666
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever gets you off.</font>

667
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.</font>

668
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a difficult condition
for people to understand.</font>

669
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at Sammy Jankis. His own
wife couldn't deal with it.</font>

670
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.</font>

671
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually she came
to see me at the office.</font>

672
01:02:54,797 --> 01:02:56,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found out all kinds of shit.</font>

673
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She told me about life
with Sammy, how she treated him.</i></font>

674
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for seeing me.</font>

675
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It got to the point where she'd get Sammy
to hide food all around the house.</font>

676
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then she'd stop feeding him
to see if his hunger...</font>

677
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.</font>

678
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,820
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She wasn't a cruel person. She
just wanted old Sammy back.</i></font>

679
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.</font>

680
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Jankis, the company's position
isn't that Sammy is faking anything...</font>

681
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">just that his condition
can't be shown to be...</font>

682
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:24,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to know what your honest
opinion about Sammy is.</font>

683
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">We shouldn't even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.</font>

684
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?</font>

685
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to understand. When
I look at Sammy...</font>

686
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see some... vegetable.</font>

687
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see my same old Sammy.</font>

688
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think that's like for me
to suspect he might be...</font>

689
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:46,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">imagining this whole problem...</font>

690
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that if I just could
say the right thing...</font>

691
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd snap out of it and go
back to being normal?</font>

692
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I knew that my old
Sammy were truly gone...</font>

693
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.</font>

694
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as I have doubt, I can't
say good-bye and move on.</font>

695
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me?</font>

696
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds...</font>

697
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.</font>

698
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know... what you
honestly believe.</font>

699
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.</font>

700
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

701
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I helped her. I thought
she just needed some kind of answer.</font>

702
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think it was important
what the answer was...</font>

703
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">just that she had
one to believe.</font>

704
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?</font>

705
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it.</font>

706
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!</font>

707
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Geez!</font>

708
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are you
doing in my car?</font>

709
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, your sense of humor
went with the memory?</font>

710
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you even know why you're here?
- Unfinished business.</font>

711
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny, let me inform you.</font>

712
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your business here
is very much finished.</font>

713
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?</font>

714
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schmuck, whose house do you
think you just walked out of?</font>

715
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.</font>

716
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice shot, Leibovitz.</font>

717
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll wanna make a note.
You can't trust her.</font>

718
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Why's that?</font>

719
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because by now she's taken a look
at this suit and the car...</font>

720
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's starting to figure out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.</font>

721
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's already got you staying
with her, for Christ's sakes.</font>

722
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't go back in there. Let
me give you the name of a motel.</font>

723
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.</font>

724
01:06:10,617 --> 01:06:12,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, "bad news"?</font>

725
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's involved with drugs.</font>

726
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. These. You see these?</font>

727
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the bar where she works.</font>

728
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.</font>

729
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">She takes orders
for him, arranges meets.</font>

730
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">He writes messages
on the back of these.</font>

731
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.</font>

732
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:33,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...</font>

733
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's gonna use you
to protect herself.</font>

734
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">From who?</font>

735
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.</font>

736
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.</font>

737
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.</font>

738
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:49,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah? Maybe she'll make it you.
Is that it?</font>

739
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You worried that she's gonna
use me against you?</font>

740
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Why not?</font>

741
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she doesn't
know who I am.</font>

742
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.</font>

743
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">She doesn't know anything
about your investigation, okay, Einstein?</font>

744
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">So write this down.</font>

745
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:12,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.</font>

746
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not lying. Take my pen.
Write this down.</font>

747
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not trust her.</font>

748
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There. You happy now?
- I won't be happy until you leave town.</font>

749
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

750
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever wonder how long
you can hang around here</font>

751
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:36,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">before people start
asking questions?</font>

752
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:37,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of questions?</font>

753
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same sort of questions you
should be asking yourself.</font>

754
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like what?
- Like, how did you get this suit, the car?</font>

755
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have money.
- From what?</font>

756
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife's death. I used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.</font>

757
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">So in your grief you wandered
into a Jaguar dealership.</font>

758
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a clue, do you?</font>

759
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes, I do.</font>

760
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.</font>

761
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Leonard Shelby. I am
from San Francisco...</font>

762
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who you were. You
do not know who you are...</font>

763
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you've become since...
the incident.</font>

764
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wander around playing
detective.</font>

765
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even know
how long ago it was.</font>

766
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?</font>

767
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't sell insurance.</font>

768
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:27,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I investigated it.
- Right, right...</font>

769
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:29,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an investigator.</font>

770
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:33,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you should start
investigating yourself.</font>

771
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:35,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for the advice.</font>

772
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, do me a favor.
Don't go back in there.</font>

773
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you take the motel
out of town?</font>

774
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been fun, Lenny.</font>

775
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Do not trust her."</font>

776
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Don't believe his lies."</font>

777
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck it. I need my own place.</font>

778
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. She shouldn't have
given me that responsibility.</font>

779
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a claims investigator,
not a doctor.</font>

780
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I guess.</font>

781
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've got all sorts
of other considerations.</font>

782
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Legal responsibility,
large financial...</font>

783
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is this?</font>

784
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write this down. Write down what happened.
Write it down.</font>

785
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentrate. Keep it in mind.
Find a pen.</font>

786
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

787
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it look like? He
beat the shit out of me.</font>

788
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

789
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

790
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd
beat the shit out of me.</font>

791
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Why? Because of you.</font>

792
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!</font>

793
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Take it easy.</font>

794
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're safe. It's okay.</font>

795
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Just sit down.</font>

796
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

797
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Sit down.</font>

798
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. You're okay.</font>

799
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just get some ice
for your face.</font>

800
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

801
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did exactly what you
told me to do.</font>

802
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to Dodd...</font>

803
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I told him that I didn't
have any of Jimmy's money...</font>

804
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the drugs...</font>

805
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:14,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that this Teddy must
have taken everything.</font>

806
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did he say?</font>

807
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't believe me.</font>

808
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.</font>

809
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he just started hitting me.</font>

810
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

811
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I'll go see him.</font>

812
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

813
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give him
some bruises of his own</font>

814
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:38,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">and tell him to look
for a guy called Teddy.</font>

815
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll kill you, Lenny.</font>

816
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife used to call me Lenny.</font>

817
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

818
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I hated it.</font>

819
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy... this guy
is so dangerous.</font>

820
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's just think of something else, okay?
- No, no.</font>

821
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:02,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just tell me what he looks like...
and where I can find him.</font>

822
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.</font>

823
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll probably find you.</font>

824
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.</font>

825
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

826
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.</font>

827
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just write it all down.</font>

828
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

829
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be fine.</font>

830
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?</font>

831
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Front desk?</font>

832
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:20,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burt. Right. This
is Mr. Shelby in room 21.</font>

833
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't want any calls.</font>

834
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. None at all.</font>

835
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.</font>

836
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.</font>

837
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he want?</font>

838
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to know what happened
to Jimmy and his money.</font>

839
01:13:43,993 --> 01:13:45,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks I have it,
he thinks I took it.</font>

840
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, did you?</font>

841
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

842
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this all about?
- Fuck!</font>

843
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?</font>

844
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I have this... condition.</font>

845
01:14:00,213 --> 01:14:02,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know all about your fucking
condition, Leonard!</font>

846
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably know more about it than you do.
You don't have</font>

847
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">a fucking clue about anything else.</font>

848
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

849
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened is that Jimmy went
to meet some guy named Teddy.</font>

850
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:12,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.</font>

851
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know</font>

852
01:14:14,842 --> 01:14:16,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you know this
Teddy, or how well.</font>

853
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!</font>

854
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not.
- Help me.</font>

855
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:20,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

856
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get rid of Dodd for me.</font>

857
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.</font>

858
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think I am? I'm not
gonna kill someone for money.</font>

859
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What then? Love?</font>

860
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you kill for?</font>

861
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:34,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.</font>

862
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to me. I wasn't
fucking married to her.</font>

863
01:14:36,965 --> 01:14:38,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't talk about my wife.</font>

864
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:40,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can talk
about whoever the fuck I want!</font>

865
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember.</font>

866
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could call your wife a fucking
whore and we could still be friends.</font>

867
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.</font>

868
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know how,
you fucking idiot!</font>

869
01:14:49,544 --> 01:14:51,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy. This has
nothing to do with me.</font>

870
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!</font>

871
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't get scared,
but, hey, can you get angry?</font>

872
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

873
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pathetic piece of shit.</font>

874
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say whatever
the fuck I want...</font>

875
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't have a fucking
clue, you fucking retard!</font>

876
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.</font>

877
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:12,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you now, because I'm
gonna enjoy it so much more...</font>

878
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.</font>

879
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you lose your pen?</font>

880
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:20,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's too bad, freak. Otherwise, you
could write yourself a little note...</font>

881
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">about how much Natalie
hates your retarded guts</font>

882
01:15:22,803 --> 01:15:24,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that I called your wife
a fuckin' whore.</font>

883
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't say another fuckin' word.
- About your whore of a wife?</font>

884
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read about your condition,
Leonard.</font>

885
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:37,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what one of the causes
of short-term memory loss is?</font>

886
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:38,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Venereal disease.</font>

887
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks...</font>

888
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and turned you
into a fucking retard!</font>

889
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sad, sad freak.</font>

890
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can say whatever
the fuck I want...</font>

891
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't remember.</font>

892
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll still be best friends...</font>

893
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">or maybe even lovers.</font>

894
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:06,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

895
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you soon.</font>

896
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay focused. Find a pen.</font>

897
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta write this down.
Gotta write it down.</font>

898
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentrate. Concentrate.
Concentrate.</font>

899
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind.</font>

900
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.</font>

901
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write this down. Write this
down, exactly what happened.</font>

902
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.</font>

903
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta find a pen.
Geez! Come on.</font>

904
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep focused. Keep focused.</font>

905
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it in mind. Come on.
Find a pen.</font>

906
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write this note. Write
down what happened.</font>

907
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:00,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.</font>

908
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

909
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it look like? He
beat the shit out of me.</font>

910
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

911
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

912
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:18,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd
beat the shit out of me.</font>

913
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

914
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Burt, from the front desk.</font>

915
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah?
- I know you said you didn't want any calls.</font>

916
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this guy called. He's on the phone now.
He says he's a cop.</font>

917
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A cop?
- Yeah.</font>

918
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:47,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says you're really gonna
wanna know what he has to say.</font>

919
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not too good on the phone.</font>

920
01:17:49,182 --> 01:17:50,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to look people
in the eye when I talk to them.</font>

921
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.</font>

922
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just have a seat.</font>

923
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

924
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do you think
it's gonna take you?</font>

925
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?</font>

926
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:20,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">That depends on if he's here
in town or if he's moved on.</font>

927
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have my file here.</font>

928
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you something? If you
have all of that information...</font>

929
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">then why haven't the police
found him for you?</font>

930
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?</font>

931
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:40,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't think he exists. You
see, I told them what I remembered.</font>

932
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was asleep.</font>

933
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something woke me up.</font>

934
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,065
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Her side of the bed was cold.</i></font>

935
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She'd obviously
been out of bed for a while.</i></font>

936
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">There had to be a second man.</font>

937
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.</font>

938
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about the last thing
that I do remember.</font>

939
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police...</font>

940
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.</font>

941
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">John G. was clever.</font>

942
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was clever.</font>

943
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:15,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, he took the dead
man's gun, he replaced it</font>

944
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the sap
that he hit me with.</font>

945
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.</font>

946
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found the sap with my blood
on it in the dead man's hand.</font>

947
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they only found my gun.</font>

948
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't need to look
for anybody else.</font>

949
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts, and I had brain damage.</font>

950
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.</font>

951
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:43,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard, you can stay here for a couple
of days if it'll help you.</font>

952
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

953
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go back to work.</font>

954
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, just make yourself at home.</font>

955
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:56,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can watch TV or you can have
some food, whatever you want, okay?</font>

956
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.</font>

957
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.</font>

958
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Natalie."</font>

959
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.</font>

960
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On the house.
- Thanks.</font>

961
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really do have a problem.</font>

962
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like that cop said.</font>

963
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your condition.</font>

964
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's perfect.</font>

965
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the last thing
that you do remember?</font>

966
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:01,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My wife.
- That's sweet.</font>

967
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dying.</font>

968
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember my wife dying.</font>

969
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get you another one.</font>

970
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this one's dusty.</font>

971
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you calling me?
What do you want?</font>

972
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?</font>

973
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Something bad, maybe.</font>

974
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:32,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you asking me? I can't
remember what I've done.</font>

975
01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:34,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't believe me anyway.</font>

976
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of my condition. You don't
believe someone with this condition.</font>

977
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody believed Sammy! I didn't
even fucking believe Sammy!</font>

978
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ferdy's Bar."</font>

979
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Come by after. Natalie."</font>

980
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have a beer, please.</font>

981
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want?
- A beer, please.</font>

982
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just waltz in here dressed
like that and ask for a beer.</font>

983
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?</font>

984
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.</font>

985
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. We met before, right?</font>

986
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.</font>

987
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember. I have no
short-term memory. It's not amnesia.</font>

988
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the memory guy.
- How do you know about me?</font>

989
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">My boyfriend told me about you.</font>

990
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?</font>

991
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

992
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows you. He
told me about you.</font>

993
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said you were staying
at the Discount.</font>

994
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.</font>

995
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...</font>

996
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">wouldn't know how he got
here or what he'd done.</font>

997
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said I get a lot of guys
around here like that.</font>

998
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chronic alcoholism is one cause
of short-term memory loss.</font>

999
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you Teddy?
- No. My name's Leonard.</font>

1000
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.</font>

1001
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.</font>

1002
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?</font>

1003
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't remember where
you've been or what you've just done.</font>

1004
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:15,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.</font>

1005
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.</font>

1006
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,600
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Your</i> pocket.</font>

1007
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bar bet. Care to contribute?</font>

1008
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.</font>

1009
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:56,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.</font>

1010
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:09,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1011
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On the house.
- Thanks.</font>

1012
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.</font>

1013
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's amazing what a little brain
damage will do for your credibility.</font>

1014
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess it's some kind of poetic
justice for not believing Sammy.</font>

1015
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the truth
about my condition, Officer?</font>

1016
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know anything.</font>

1017
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel angry, you
don't know why.</font>

1018
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel guilty, you
have no idea why.</font>

1019
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea 10 minutes later.</font>

1020
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like Sammy. What if I've done
something like Sammy?</font>

1021
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't tell you what happened
to Sammy and his wife?</font>

1022
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">She came to see me at my office. I thought
she was trying to catch me off guard...</font>

1023
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so I didn't tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking...</i></font>

1024
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:13,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>just that his condition
was mental, not physical.</i></font>

1025
01:27:14,010 --> 01:27:16,970
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I found out later that she went
home and gave Sammy his final exam.</i></font>

1026
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy? It's time for my shot.</font>

1027
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:39,620
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her.</i></font>

1028
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So she found a way to test him.</i></font>

1029
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy. It's time for my shot.</font>

1030
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,060
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She really thought
she'd call his bluff.</i></font>

1031
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

1032
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:17,070
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Or she just didn't wanna live
with the things she'd put him through.</i></font>

1033
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy.</font>

1034
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for my shot.</font>

1035
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't hurt.</font>

1036
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She went into a coma
and never recovered.</i></font>

1037
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:30,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.</i></font>

1038
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been in a home ever since.</font>

1039
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,730
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He doesn't even know
that his wife is dead.</i></font>

1040
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.</font>

1041
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't interested
in the money.</font>

1042
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just needed
to understand his problem.</font>

1043
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:47,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con man.</i></font>

1044
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,460
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>When she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.</i></font>

1045
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.</i></font>

1046
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I know. You fake it.</font>

1047
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:59,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think you're supposed to recognize
somebody, you just pretend to.</font>

1048
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.</i></font>

1049
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bluff it to seem
less of a freak.</font>

1050
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What drug dealer?</font>

1051
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.</font>

1052
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:41,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?</font>

1053
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Jag's out front. Should
have put it around back.</font>

1054
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.</font>

1055
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:49,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess I wanted to get something
down before it slipped my mind.</font>

1056
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:51,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right then, give me the keys.
I'll move it for you.</font>

1057
01:30:51,509 --> 01:30:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be all right
for a minute.</font>

1058
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait out there.</font>

1059
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a minute. I gotta
get something for you.</font>

1060
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:05,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fact six: Car license SG 137IU.</font>

1061
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:13,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Wait a minute, will ya?</font>

1062
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?</font>

1063
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man. Come on, Leonard. How
many times I gotta tell you?</font>

1064
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not safe for you
to hang around here anymore.</font>

1065
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:24,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

1066
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that cop's looking
for you.</font>

1067
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta get you a new
identity, some new clothes.</font>

1068
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">A different car would do for now.
So put these on.</font>

1069
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">What cop?</font>

1070
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a bad cop. He's the one that checked
you into the Discount Inn.</font>

1071
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been calling you for days
now, telling you shit,</font>

1072
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:41,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">slipping envelopes under your door.
Shit like that.</font>

1073
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know this?
- He told me. He thinks it's funny.</font>

1074
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's been laughing at you.
- You're full of shit.</font>

1075
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:49,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not. He knows you're no good
on the phone, so he's been calling you.</font>

1076
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes you don't
answer the phone...</font>

1077
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">so he slips shit under your door to scare
you into answering the phone again...</font>

1078
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">giving you a line of crap about John G.
being some local drug dealer.</font>

1079
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jimmy Grants.
- Who's Jimmy Grants?</font>

1080
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonard,
Jimmy's the drug dealer.</font>

1081
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cop wants to know
how his operation's run.</font>

1082
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.</font>

1083
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh. How do you know him?</font>

1084
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:14,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.</font>

1085
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:17,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he knew I was helping
you, he'd fucking kill me.</font>

1086
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:21,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">So take these clothes, put them
on and get the fuck out of here.</font>

1087
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:23,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Leonard. Just go.</font>

1088
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are full of shit.</font>

1089
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:50,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Come by after. Natalie."</font>

1090
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ferdy's Bar."</font>

1091
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Jimmy.</font>

1092
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I thought you
were somebody else.</font>

1093
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1094
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okay.</font>

1095
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?</font>

1096
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's not gonna bring her along.
He'll come by himself, right?</font>

1097
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:11,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.</font>

1098
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Officer. I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.</font>

1099
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:18,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?</font>

1100
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right there.</font>

1101
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:04,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny.</font>

1102
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer Gammell.</font>

1103
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:14,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Come on.</font>

1104
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Smile.
- Not here.</font>

1105
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here.</font>

1106
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?</font>

1107
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:46,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.</font>

1108
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I'm undercover.</font>

1109
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the directions
where he's going.</font>

1110
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:58,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?</font>

1111
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It wouldn't be appropriate.</font>

1112
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice picture. I look thin.</font>

1113
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Lenny.</font>

1114
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make him beg.</font>

1115
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teddy!</font>

1116
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:43,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Teddy!</font>

1117
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jimmy.</font>

1118
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:56,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?</font>

1119
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expecting any other Jimmys
out here, Memory Man?</font>

1120
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:02,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.</font>

1121
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the fuck's Teddy?</font>

1122
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

1123
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfuck... Fuckin' retard!</font>

1124
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Strip.
- You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.</font>

1125
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strip!</font>

1126
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:24,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">My associates are not the kind
of people you wanna piss off.</font>

1127
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:25,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say anything else.</font>

1128
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:28,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.</font>

1129
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cocksucker.</font>

1130
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your pants too.</font>

1131
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.</font>

1132
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?</font>

1133
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:46,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!</font>

1134
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?</font>

1135
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.</font>

1136
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what?</font>

1137
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:58,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!</font>

1138
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sammy.</font>

1139
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said "Sammy." How does
he know about Sammy?</font>

1140
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck.</font>

1141
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have I done?</font>

1142
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mister, I need help. There's a guy
in here, he's hurt bad.</font>

1143
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.</font>

1144
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.</font>

1145
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.</font>

1146
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:20,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.</font>

1147
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell were you
guys doing down here?</font>

1148
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:26,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't remember.
I have this condition.</font>

1149
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope it's not as serious
as his, 'cause this guy's dead.</font>

1150
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:31,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!</font>

1151
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:35,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.</font>

1152
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.</font>

1153
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up. Get up.</font>

1154
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:42,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny, you got the wrong idea.</font>

1155
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that? He knew me.</font>

1156
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:49,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.</font>

1157
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit. He's not the guy.</font>

1158
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:56,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name is James F. Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.</font>

1159
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:58,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?</font>

1160
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.</font>

1161
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:06,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.</font>

1162
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:08,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.</font>

1163
01:42:08,593 --> 01:42:10,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just figured we'd make
a few dollars on the side.</font>

1164
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:14,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.</font>

1165
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy at the front desk let him
know if anybody came snooping around.</font>

1166
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:20,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called Jimmy the minute he saw
you taking a picture of the dump.</font>

1167
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!</font>

1168
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell
him about fuckin' Sammy?</font>

1169
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.</font>

1170
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"</font>

1171
01:42:31,130 --> 01:42:34,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great story. Gets better
every time you tell it.</font>

1172
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you lie to yourself
to be happy.</font>

1173
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:39,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.</font>

1174
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares if there's a few little details
you'd rather not remember?</font>

1175
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:47,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.</font>

1176
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:49,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wife surviving the assault.</font>

1177
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her not believing
your condition.</font>

1178
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.</font>

1179
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">The insulin.</font>

1180
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:02,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.</font>

1181
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right. Like you tell
yourself over and over again.</font>

1182
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conditioning yourself
to remember.</font>

1183
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.</font>

1184
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:15,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.</font>

1185
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never said
that Sammy was faking.</font>

1186
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:20,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You exposed him for what he was...
a fraud.</font>

1187
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was wrong.
That's the whole point.</font>

1188
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.</font>

1189
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:32,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was <i>your</i> wife
who had diabetes.</font>

1190
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:39,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouch.</font>

1191
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:44,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife wasn't diabetic.</font>

1192
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?</font>

1193
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.</font>

1194
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:59,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?</font>

1195
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:02,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.</font>

1196
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:05,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.</font>

1197
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was to you.</font>

1198
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.</font>

1199
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?</font>

1200
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.</font>

1201
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.</font>

1202
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will. Somehow I'll know.</font>

1203
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:19,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't remember!</font>

1204
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:21,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it's done, I will know.
It'll be different.</font>

1205
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:25,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought so too. In fact,
I was sure of it, but you didn't!</font>

1206
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. The real John G.</font>

1207
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.</font>

1208
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.</font>

1209
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:41,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.</font>

1210
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.</font>

1211
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one that helped you find the other
guy in your bathroom that night...</font>

1212
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.</font>

1213
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found him. You killed him.</font>

1214
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:59,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you didn't remember. So
I helped you start looking again...</font>

1215
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:02,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking for the guy
you already killed.</font>

1216
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? So who was he?</font>

1217
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just some guy. Does
it even matter who?</font>

1218
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.</font>

1219
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couple of junkies too strung out to realize
your wife didn't live alone.</font>

1220
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when you killed him, I was so
convinced that you'd remember.</font>

1221
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:24,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it didn't stick.</font>

1222
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.</font>

1223
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took that picture...
just when you did it.</font>

1224
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look how happy you are.</font>

1225
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to see that face again.</font>

1226
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.</font>

1227
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you a reason to live, and you
were more than happy to help.</font>

1228
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.</font>

1229
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like your police file.</font>

1230
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?</font>

1231
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:02,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.</font>

1232
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.</font>

1233
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how many towns?</font>

1234
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many John
G.'s or James G.'s?</font>

1235
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, Lenny. I'm
a fucking John G.</font>

1236
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:16,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.</font>

1237
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:19,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name's John Edward Gammell.</font>

1238
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:20,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheer up.</font>

1239
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's plenty of John
G.'s for us to find.</font>

1240
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:28,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you do is moan.</font>

1241
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:31,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.</font>

1242
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one that put
it all together.</font>

1243
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:37,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.</font>

1244
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dead wife to pine for. A
sense of purpose to your life.</font>

1245
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">A romantic quest that you wouldn't
end even if I wasn't in the picture.</font>

1246
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.</font>

1247
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a killer. That's why
you're so good at it.</font>

1248
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing? You
know what time it is?</font>

1249
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.</font>

1250
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

1251
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:15,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a killer.</font>

1252
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.</font>

1253
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I just let myself
forget what you've told me?</font>

1254
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:48,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I just let myself
forget what you made me do?</font>

1255
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I just want
another puzzle to solve?</font>

1256
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another John G. to look for?</font>

1257
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:10,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a John G.</font>

1258
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:14,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can be my John G.</font>

1259
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I lie to myself to be happy?</font>

1260
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your case, Teddy...</font>

1261
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">yes, I will.</font>

1262
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's not your car!</font>

1263
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:49,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!</font>

1264
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!</font>

1265
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody'll recognize it!</font>

1266
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:58,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I think I'd rather be
mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.</font>

1267
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might hang on to this
for a while.</font>

1268
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny.</font>

1269
01:49:04,834 --> 01:49:05,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, don't let me...</font>

1270
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:08,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you help me find the keys?</font>

1271
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:10,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me find my keys.</font>

1272
01:49:10,814 --> 01:49:12,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny!</font>

1273
01:49:18,638 --> 01:49:19,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lenny!</font>

1274
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.</font>

1275
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to believe that my actions
still have meaning...</font>

1276
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:40,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">even if I can't remember them.</font>

1277
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:45,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to believe that when
my eyes are closed...</font>

1278
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">the world's still here.</font>

1279
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:50,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I believe
the world's still here?</font>

1280
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:55,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it still out there?</font>

1281
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:00,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1282
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all need mirrors to remind
ourselves who we are.</font>

1283
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no different.</font>

1284
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:24,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, where was I?</font>
