<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She had no diseases at all.</i></font>

147
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,090
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i></font>

my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i></font>

my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i></font>

150
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,140
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Marla, the big tourist.</i></font>

151
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,150
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i></font>

152
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,900
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i></font>

153
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I couldn't cry.
So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i></font>

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i></font>

155
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,960

<font color="#FFFFFF">Marla, you liar!
You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!</font>

158
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,890
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i></font>

159

<font color="#FFFFFF">To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.</font>

163
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i></font>

164
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,460

Meryl Streep's skeleton would look</i></font>

being extra nice to everybody.</i></font>

166
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm still here.</font>

167
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't know for how long.</font>

168
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.</font>

169
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've got some good news.</font>

170
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I no longer have any fear of death.</font>

171
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... I am in a pretty lonely place.</font>

172
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will have sex with me.</font>

173
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so close to the end,</font>

174
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all I want is to get laid for
the last time.</font>

175
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,</font>

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.</font>

177
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, let's thank Chloe.</font>

178
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Chloe.</font>

179
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's ready ourself
for guided meditation.</font>

of your cave.</font>

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,190

184
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i></font>

185
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that would heal if you could stop
tonguing it, but you can't.</i></font>

186
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">deeper into your cave as you walk.</font>

187
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,120
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You feel
a healing energy all around you.</i></font>

188
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,290
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now find your power animal.</i></font>

189
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slide.</font>

190
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Let's partner up.</font>

191
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick someone special to you tonight.</font>

192
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

193
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We need to talk.
- Sure.</font>

194
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm onto you.
- What?</font>

195
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.</font>

196
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry?</font>

197
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Tibetan-philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.</font>

198
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.</font>

199
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

200
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're a tourist.</font>

201
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.</font>

202
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you at testicular cancer!</font>

203
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you practicing this.</font>

204
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.</font>

205
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it going as well as you hoped...
"Rupert"?</font>

206
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll expose you.
- Go ahead. I'll expose you.</font>

207
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come together. Let yourselves cry.</font>

208
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Why are you doing this?</font>

209
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.</font>

210
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, this is important.
These are my groups.</font>

211
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been coming for over a year.</font>

212
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.</font>

213
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">When people think you're dying,
they really listen to you instead of...</font>

214
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.</font>

215
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

216
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Share yourself, completely.</font>

217
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.</font>

218
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- I'm not kidding.</font>

219
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't cry if another faker is present,
and I need this.</font>

220
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you gotta find somewhere else to go.</font>

221
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.</font>

222
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a second. Hold on.</font>

223
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.</font>

224
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.</font>

225
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.</font>

226
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.</font>

227
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?</font>

228
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

229
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.</font>

230
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.</font>

231
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want brain parasites.</font>

232
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take the blood,
but I want brain dementia.</font>

233
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.</font>

234
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, you have four. I only have two.</font>

235
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.</font>

236
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we both have three...</font>

237
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! You left half your clothes.</font>

238
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, are you selling those?
- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.</font>

239
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we each have three. That's six.</font>

240
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.</font>

241
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,580
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The girl had done her homework.</i></font>

242
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. No. I want bowel cancer.
- That's your favorite too?</font>

243
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.</font>

244
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.</font>

245
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deal.</font>

246
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looks like this is goodbye.
- Let's not make a big thing out of it.</font>

247
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's this for not making a big thing?</font>

248
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Marla! Marla!</font>

249
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
- Should we?</font>

250
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might wanna switch nights.</font>

251
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

252
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i></font>

253
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,550
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i></font>

254
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,180
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i></font>

255
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't have your name!
Who are you?</font>

256
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?</font>

257
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of the stupid names
you give each night?</font>

258
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i></font>

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A hotel?
- Yeah.</font>

432
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?</font>

433
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.</font>

434
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- You called me</font>

435
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,610

436
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.</font>

437
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,820

438
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would... Would that be a problem?</font>

439
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a problem for you to ask?</font>

440
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,460

441
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,340

446
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.</font>

447
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.</font>

448
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.</font>

449
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">So someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment</font>

450
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">that one reel ends
and the next one begins.</font>

451
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you look, you can see little dots come
into the upper right corner of the screen.</font>

452
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the industry,
we call them cigarette burns.</font>

453
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the cue for a changeover.</font>

454
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.</font>

455
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone want this shit job?</font>

456
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause it affords him
interesting opportunities.</font>

457
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody knows
that they saw it but they did.</font>

462
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice big cock.</font>

463
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.</font>

464
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.</font>

465
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</font>

466

<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.</font>

467

<font color="#FFFFFF">Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,</font>

468

sneezed on endives...</font>

469

<font color="#FFFFFF">As for the cream of mushroom soup...</font>

470

- You get the idea.</font>

471
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.</font>

472
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?</font>

473
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't.</font>

474
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna die without any scars.</font>

475
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.</font>

476
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So go crazy! Let it rip.</font>

477
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.</font>

478
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gives a shit? No one's watching.
What do you care?</font>

479
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is crazy. You want me to hit you?</font>

480
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

481
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.</font>

482
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is so fucking stupid.</font>

483
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear!</font>

484
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow! Christ!</font>

485
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the ear, man?</font>

486
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I fucked it up.
- No, that was perfect.</font>

487
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh! Agh!</font>

488
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's all right.</font>

489
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really hurts.</font>

490
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

491
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,500

504
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,620

716
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't have you talking to her about me.
- Why would I talk to her?</font>

717
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say anything about me
or what goes on</font>

718
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,490

we're done.</font>

719
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,120

- OK.</font>

720
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You promise?
- I promise.</font>

721
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Promise.
- I just said, I promise! What...</font>

722
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's three times you promised.</font>

723
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i></font>

724
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,300

725
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Oh, harder, harder!</font>

726
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I could have moved to another room.</i></font>

727
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,660
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i></font>

728

730
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,100

- Ooh!</font>

732
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. No, thank you.
- I found a cigarette.</font>

733
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,570

Come back Monday with clean clothes.</font>

the incident at your former condo.</i></font>

751

- I don't know if you're aware,</font>

752
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,530

into your front-door lock.</font>

- Yes, sir. Very strange.</i></font>

756
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?</font>

757
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,670

ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.</font>

758

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Do you know what this means?
- No. What does it mean?</i></font>

759
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means it was home-made.</font>

760

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.</font>

763

767
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. It's hard to know

773
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,260
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i></font>

774
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:19,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. OK?</font>

775
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved every stick of
furniture in that place.</font>

776
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i></font>

777
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- It was me!

778
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i></font>

779
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.</font>

780
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,910
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i></font>

781
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.</font>

782
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,880
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- OK?
- OK.</i></font>

783
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,630
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Except for their humping,</i></font>

784
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,550
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tyler and Marla were never
in the same room.</i></font>

785
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,300
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My parents pulled
this exact same act for years.</i></font>

786
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.</font>

787
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You slip one on when you meet a stranger.</font>

788
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dance all night,
then you throw it away.</font>

789
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.</font>

790
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

791
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.</font>

792
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was worth every penny.</font>

793
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bridesmaid's dress.</font>

794
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone loved it intensely for one day,</font>

795
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">then tossed it.</font>

796
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a Christmas tree.</font>

797
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">So special.</font>

798
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then... bam!</font>

799
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on the side of the road.</font>

800
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tinsel still clinging to it.</font>

801
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:59,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a sex-crime victim, underwear
inside out, bound with electrical tape.</font>

802
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, it suits you.</font>

803
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can borrow it sometime.</font>

804
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get rid of her.</font>

805
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</font>

806
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,010
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i></font>

807
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.</font>

808
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.</font>

809
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,400
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Gotta get off</i></font>

810
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. Bye.</font>

811
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,820

813
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kids!</font>

814
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you still waste time with her?</font>

815
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.</font>

816
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not?</font>

817
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.</font>

818
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are we doing tonight?</font>

819
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight... we make soap.</font>

820
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- To make soap, first we render fat.</font>

821
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The salt balance has to be just right,</font>

822
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">so the best fat for soap
comes from humans.</font>

823
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait. What is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.</font>

824
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aha! Pay dirt!</font>

825
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
The fat of the land!</font>

826
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Don't pull it.</font>

827
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.</font>

828
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.</font>

829
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.</font>

830
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.</font>

831
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.</font>

832
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you then add sodium nitrate
and sawdust, you got dynamite.</font>

833
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.</font>

834
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,830
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i></font>

835
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner
when washed in one part of the river.</font>

836
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know why?
- No.</font>

837
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Humans were once sacrificed
on the hills above.</font>

838
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bodies burned, water seeped
through the ashes to create lye.</font>

839
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is lye. The crucial ingredient.</font>

840
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a soapy discharge crept into the river.</font>

841
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I see your hand, please?</font>

842
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

843
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a chemical burn.
- Agh! Aaagh!</font>

844
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll hurt more than you've ever
been burned and leave a scar.</font>

845
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this.</i></font>

846
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!</font>

847
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first soap was made
from heroes' ashes,</font>

848
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">like the first monkey shot into space.</font>

849
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.</font>

850
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I tried not to think
of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i></font>

851
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it! This is your pain,
this is your burning hand.</font>

852
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.</font>

853
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!</font>

854
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I get the point!
- No!</font>

855
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're feeling premature enlightenment.</font>

Airport parking. Long term.</font>

- No.</font>

1292
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?</font>

1293
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:01,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.</font>

1294
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:05,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why wasn't I included in the beginning?
- Fight Club was the beginning.</font>

1295
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's left the basements
and it's Project Mayhem.</font>

1296
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We started Fight Club
together. Remember?</font>

1297
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as much mine as it is yours.</font>

1298
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?</font>

1299
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">This does not belong to us.</font>

1300
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are not special.
- Fuck that. You should have told me.</font>

1301
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Tyler!</font>

1302
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?</font>

1303
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">A statement of purpose?
Should I email you?</font>

1304
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,320

<font color="#FFFFFF">I will! I wanna know certain things first!</font>

1306
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,160

- Shut up!</font>

1307
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!</font>

1308
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:50,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,</font>

1309
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and especially about you and me.</font>

1310
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that supposed to mean? What...</font>

1311
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:01,510

before you die?</font>

1313
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:07,890

- Build a house.</font>

1314

<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.</font>

1315
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!</font>

1316
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?</font>

1317
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:20,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear me say?</font>

1318
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on!
- Not good enough.</font>

1319
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:24,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop fucking around! Tyler!</font>

1320
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

1321
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!</font>

1322
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">OK, man. OK.</font>

1324
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!</font>

1325
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:45,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Steer!
- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!</font>

1326
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:50,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?</font>

1327
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1328
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:56,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamn seminar.</font>

01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:00,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!</font>

1330
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:05,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let go!
- All right. Fine.</font>

1331

if you've seen Tyler.</font>

any such information to you,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thursday?</font>

1458
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:58,520

asking how good security is.</font>

- Done what?</i></font>

1467
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Had sex.
- What kind of stupid question is that?</font>

1468
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupid because the answer's yes
or because it's no?</font>

we were just having sex or making love?</font>

1472
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:55,700

Did we do it or not?</font>

1473
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.</font>

then you turn into an asshole.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke your promise.</font>

1482
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus, Tyler.
- You talked to her about me.</font>

1483
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the fuck is going on?
- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.</font>

1484
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do people think that I'm you?</font>

1485
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me!</font>

1486
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:37,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

1487
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?</font>

1488

- Yes, you do.</font>

1490
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:51,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?</font>

1491
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I don't know.</font>

1492
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got it.
- No.</font>

1493
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.</font>

1494
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because...</font>

1495
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:09,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it!</font>

1496
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're the same person.</font>

1497
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

1498
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,700
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing...</i></font>

1499
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.</font>

1500
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:23,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could not do this on your own.</font>

1501
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the ways you wish you could be -
that's me.</font>

1502
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look like you wanna look,
fuck like you wanna fuck,</font>

1503
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:35,840

I'm free in all the ways that you are not.</font>

1504
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

1505
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:40,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?</font>

1506
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This isn't possible. This is crazy.
- People do it every day.</font>

1507
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:48,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.</font>

1508
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:52,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.</font>

1509
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.</font>

1510
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:00,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should do this again sometime.</font>

1511
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:03,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Other times,
you imagine you're watching me.</font>

1512
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:06,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is your first time, you have to fight.</font>

1513
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler Durden.</font>

1515
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not your job
or how much money you have!</font>

1516

- Rented in your name.</font>

1517

- You work nights because you can't sleep.</font>

1518
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or you stay up and make soap.
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.</font>

1519
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:29,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technically, you are.
But it's all the same to her.</font>

1520
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:33,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1521
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:36,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you see our dilemma.</font>

1522
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows too much.</font>

1523
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:42,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.</font>

1524
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... What are you saying?</font>

1525
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:51,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bullshit. This is bullshit!
I'm not listening to this.</font>

1526
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.</font>

1527
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:57,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we simply
do not have time for this crap.</font>

this list of phone calls, please.</font>

their fingertips with lye.</font>

1556

<font color="#FFFFFF">You got about 30 seconds.</font>

1570
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:58,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I've been acting very strange, OK?</font>

1571
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it seems there's two sides to me...</font>

1572
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:03,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two sides?
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.</font>

1573
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:07,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deserved that.
But I realized something important.</font>

1574
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:08,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1575
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:11,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">The full extent of our relationship
wasn't clear to me until now,</font>

1576
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">for reasons I won't go into.</font>

1577
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.</font>

1578
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:21,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.</font>

1579
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.</font>

1580
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.</font>

1581
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You do?
- I really do.</font>

1582
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:36,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.</font>

1583
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:39,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your life is in danger.</font>

1584
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:44,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- You need to leave town for a while.</font>

1585
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:46,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of any major city.
Just go camping...</font>

1586
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an insane person.</font>

1587
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:52,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!</font>

1588
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not safe.
- Shut up!</font>

1589
01:58:56,710 --> 01:59:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.</font>

1590
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:06,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.</font>

1591
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... you're intolerable.</font>

1592
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:13,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have very serious emotional problems</font>

1593
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:15,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">for which you should seek
professional help.</font>

1594
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.</font>

1595
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:23,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this anymore.</font>

1596
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. I won't.</font>

1597
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gone.</font>

1598
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!</font>

1599
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:38,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!</font>

1600
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:40,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am trying to protect you!</font>

1601
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I never want to see you again!
- If that's what it takes...</font>

1602
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:46,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait right here.</font>

1603
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it right there! Shut up!</font>

1604
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:56,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I will never bother you again.</font>

1605
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up!</font>

1606
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus.</font>

1607
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:06,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you doing this?
- They think you're a threat.</font>

1608
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't explain now. Trust me.</font>

1609
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I see where you're going,
you won't be safe.</font>

1610
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.</font>

1611
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:17,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for a couple of days, OK?</font>

1612
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:18,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler...</font>

1613
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.</font>

1614
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. I need you to arrest me.</font>

1615
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:43,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the leader of a terrorist organization</font>

1616
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:47,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.</font>

1617
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:51,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.</font>

1618
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:56,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.</font>

1619
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:59,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a tightly regimented organization</font>

1620
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:04,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.</font>

1621
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.</font>

1622
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:11,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's our headquarters.</font>

1623
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:16,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.</font>

1624
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the basement, you'll find some bathtubs</font>

1625
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:24,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.</font>

1626
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:28,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe the plan is
to blow up the headquarters</font>

1627
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:30,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">of these credit-card companies</font>

1628
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:32,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the TRW building.</font>

1629
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why these buildings?
Why credit-card companies?</font>

1630
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:41,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.</font>

1631
02:01:42,210 --> 02:01:44,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll create total chaos.</font>

1632
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.</font>

1633
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:02,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really admire what you're doing.</font>

1634
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- You're a brave man to order this.</font>

1635
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:09,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a genius, sir.</font>

1636
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,</font>

1637
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">we gotta get his balls.</font>

1638
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:20,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.</font>

1639
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:23,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It'll set quite an example.
- You're making a big mistake!</font>

1640
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!</font>

1641
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told us you'd say that too.</font>

1642
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I am Tyler Durden.</font>

1643
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
We're aborting this mission now.</font>

1644
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:38,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you would definitely say that.</font>

1645
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go!</font>

1646
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:46,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!</font>

1647
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is somebody timing this?</font>

1648
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:51,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your mouth shut.</font>

1649
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:54,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit!</font>

1650
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Some of this information checks out.
- Uh- huh?</font>

1651
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:04,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.</font>

1652
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, wait!</font>

1653
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:07,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got him?
- I got him.</font>

1654
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, we have to do this.</font>

1655
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:12,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?</font>

1656
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:15,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!</font>

1657
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:22,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back up. Face down on the floor right now!</font>

1658
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down on the floor!</font>

1659
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:34,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">First person that comes out this door
gets a lead salad! Understand?</font>

1660
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away! Stay away!</font>

1661
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:15,820
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I ran.</i></font>

1662
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:21,200
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i></font>

1663
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:25,990
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then I ran some more.</i></font>

1664
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:10,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck are you doing,
running around in your underpants?</font>

1665
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look crazy!</font>

1666
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.</font>

1667
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like Pay-per-view.</font>

1668
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Christ.</font>

1669
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:12,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what are you doing?</font>

1670
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:14,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm stopping this.
- Why?</font>

1671
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:18,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.</font>

1672
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.</font>

1673
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:23,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?</font>

1674
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:29,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">The buildings are empty. We're not
killing anyone. We're setting them free!</font>

1675
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.</font>

1676
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:34,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.</font>

1677
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:38,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.</font>

1678
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:49,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.</font>

1679
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you know, then I know.</font>

1680
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</font>

1681
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:11,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think?</font>

1682
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:15,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.</font>

1683
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:17,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull any one but the green one.</font>

1684
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you not to do that!</font>

1685
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

1686
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler, get away from the van.</font>

1687
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:37,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!</font>

1688
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:39,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

1689
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:43,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Whoa!</font>

1690
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

1691
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:50,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend</font>

1692
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:53,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!</font>

1693
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool it, Tyler!</font>

1694
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aw, come on! Don't go!</font>

1695
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1696
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:42,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three minutes. This is it.</font>

1697
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beginning.</font>

1698
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ground zero.</font>

1699
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:51,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- I think this is about where we came in.
- Want to say a few words for the occasion?</i></font>

1700
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

1701
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:57,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still can't think of anything.</font>

1702
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Flashback humor.</font>

1703
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting exciting now.</font>

1704
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.</font>

1705
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:20,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.</font>

1706
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:23,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">One step closer to economic equilibrium.</font>

1707
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:40,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why is she here?
- Tying up loose ends.</font>

1708
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!</font>

1709
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.</font>
