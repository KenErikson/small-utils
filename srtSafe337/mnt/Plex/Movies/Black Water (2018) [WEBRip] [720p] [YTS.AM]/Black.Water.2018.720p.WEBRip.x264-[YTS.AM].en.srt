00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:08,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, sunshine.</font>

3
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:15,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, we don't exactly
get any of that down here.</font>

4
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the hell am I?</font>

5
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, right now, I'd say
somewhere between...</font>

6
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Houston and Quintana River.</font>

7
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

8
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:38,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I could ask you
the same thing.</font>

9
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:42,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a long time since I saw
him this worked up over an inmate.</font>

10
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:47,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inmate?
No, that doesn't make any...</font>

11
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll wear off.
Don't worry.</font>

12
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's easy at first, I know.</font>

13
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll all come back.</font>

14
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have I been here?</font>

15
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a day now.</font>

16
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about you?</font>

17
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:14,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I stopped counting.</font>

18
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never saw the point
if I'm not going anywhere.</font>

19
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? What did you do?</font>

20
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much time you got?</font>

21
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

22
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:32,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't officially exist.
Which means neither do you.</font>

23
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:35,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black site?</font>

24
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:38,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more like a burial ground.</font>

25
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except there ain't no
ground down here.</font>

26
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:57,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're 30,000 leagues under
the goddamn sea, my friend.</font>

27
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no...</font>

28
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, whatever you've done it seems
like someone took great lengths</font>

29
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make sure
you never see the light again.</font>

30
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:20,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no...
No, this can't happen.</font>

31
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:22,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should not be here.</font>

32
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you are so, maybe
you ought to figure out why.</font>

33
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the last thing
you remember?</font>

34
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eh, that's far enough.</font>

35
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set the keys down.</font>

36
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the gun.</font>

37
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:47,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're early.
- So are you.</font>

38
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:54,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to shoot me?</font>

39
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">That depends, did you bring it?</font>

40
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

41
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me.</font>

42
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:06,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only if you say please.</font>

43
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standard issue.</font>

44
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the occasion calls for it.</font>

45
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:26,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, how did you know?</font>

46
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't I tell you?</font>

47
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one of my many talents.</font>

48
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm... Mm!
Oh, no, no.</font>

49
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:53,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You first.
- You don't trust me?</font>

50
00:07:57,078 --> 00:08:00,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pick up any tails?
- Do you really have to ask?</font>

51
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

52
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's safe.</font>

53
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn.</font>

54
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you satisfied?</font>

55
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me.</font>

56
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still have to
talk some business.</font>

57
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:35,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Business can wait.</font>

58
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:08,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, tell me Mr. Wheeler, are all
your partners this lucky?</font>

59
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucky? You never tried
the breakfast here.</font>

60
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what'd Drummond say?</font>

61
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's on standby
until we make contact.</font>

62
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our guy will turn up.
It's just a matter of time.</font>

63
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:27,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless he doesn't.
And then we lose the buyer.</font>

64
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:31,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buyer won't matter
when we find the leak.</font>

65
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:35,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we're going to
get these guys, okay?</font>

66
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:40,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But if anything goes wrong...
- I know, I know.</font>

67
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have
to worry about me.</font>

68
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:48,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am gonna go investigate
this breakfast</font>

69
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:50,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you speak so highly of.</font>

70
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring you something back?</font>

71
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

72
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you come back in an hour?</font>

73
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back inside, go.</font>

74
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:16,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to make a run
for the pickup truck.</font>

75
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:18,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll cover you.
- Scott, listen...</font>

76
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no time to talk, go.</font>

77
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scott!</font>

78
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in, let's go!</font>

79
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, shit.
The drive.</font>

80
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

81
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go back and get it.
Cover me!</font>

82
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

83
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mel!</font>

84
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

85
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

86
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

87
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're blown.
- Is the drive secure?</font>

88
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negative.
But I've got the dongle.</font>

89
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:31,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't be able to access
anything without it.</font>

90
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:35,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hundred and fifty miles east of
your location is a town called Milton.</font>

91
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a parking garage,
corner of 3rd and Roxy.</font>

92
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet me in three hours.</font>

93
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,872
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You keep your head down.</i></font>

94
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ground!</font>

95
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:53,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down!</font>

96
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy.</font>

97
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">There ya are.</font>

98
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:45,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's clean, it's not here.</font>

99
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:59,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tracked the pickup to
an alley three blocks from here.</font>

100
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Empty.
Phones no good either.</font>

101
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have swapped
the SIM after the call.</font>

102
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:08,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prep him for evac.
Notify them that we're en route.</font>

103
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think
he stashed it?</font>

104
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what
we're gonna find out.</font>

105
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">First Ballad and now Tom, looks
like your boy is cleaning up, Ed.</font>

106
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not his M.O.</font>

107
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say these bodies
beg to differ.</font>

108
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you and I both know
there's more to it than that.</font>

109
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:38,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know is that right now
he's the only one</font>

110
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">who knows the location
of those files.</font>

111
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're gonna do whatever
it takes to find them.</font>

112
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't doubt that,
Agent Ferris.</font>

113
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">But perhaps you might want
to reconsider your strategy.</font>

114
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:53,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this man very well.
Let me talk with him.</font>

115
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:56,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here as a courtesy,
nothing more.</font>

116
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your relationship with Wheeler
becomes relevant</font>

117
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">only when I deem it as such.</font>

118
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:04,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's put the breaks
on this chit chat</font>

119
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll let you know
when you're needed.</font>

120
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you wish.</font>

121
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ferris.
- You Kingsley?</font>

122
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:59,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Your boys tell me
this reservation is top priority.</font>

123
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a former asset, so Langley
needs this contained.</font>

124
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Discretion is of
the upmost importance here.</font>

125
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he been prepped?</font>

126
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sleep agent has been
administered.</font>

127
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got about 12 hours.</font>

128
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how long do you intend
to stay on my clock?</font>

129
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until we get what we need.</font>

130
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think those other men
are necessary?</font>

131
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:22,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

132
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. But if there was, my men
could sure as hell handle it.</font>

133
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:31,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but they're watchdogs.
Lackeys at best.</font>

134
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:35,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, forgive us if we don't
share your confidence.</font>

135
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:38,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Edward Rhodes
from Intelligence.</font>

136
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here just to oversee
the interrogation.</font>

137
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:44,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's quite simple.</font>

138
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay out of our way
and we'll stay out of yours.</font>

139
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:53,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, let's do this.</font>

140
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct me if I'm wrong, this
was repurposed for the navy?</font>

141
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

142
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">After it was retired
from the fleet,</font>

143
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">the government elected
not to scrap it.</font>

144
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:16,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">We figured it be better
to retrofit it</font>

145
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:19,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">and house all the Bin Laden's
around the world.</font>

146
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Former squid paid to steer.</font>

147
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stick to their side,
we stick to ours,</font>

148
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:26,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">everybody minds
their own business.</font>

149
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:30,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard rumors about this thing.
I didn't think it actually existed.</font>

150
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:35,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't. As far as
the CIA is concerned...</font>

151
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">we were never here.</font>

152
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't aware
of another pickup.</font>

153
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last minute reservation
just came down</font>

154
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:51,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Military Intelligence.</font>

155
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just another John Doe,
nothing to worry about.</font>

156
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all that nonsense
surrounding GTMO:</font>

157
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:01,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's about time
the company men went mobile.</font>

158
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:07,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I always said, it ain't really
a black site if you can find it.</font>

159
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got enough men?
- Payloads a little light.</font>

160
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:12,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need to overhaul.
But let me show you something.</font>

161
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is controlled
electronically from this room.</font>

162
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the cells.</font>

163
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that his room?
- Yes, it is.</font>

164
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see it.</font>

165
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, they all start off tough,
say they could take it,</font>

166
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:41,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">but sooner or later,
they all crack.</font>

167
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ain't that right, Marco?</font>

168
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He withstood
it all once upon a time.</font>

169
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:52,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water torture, sleep deprivation,
even erectile feeding.</font>

170
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Halls reinforced with steel.</font>

171
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toilets,
they don't lead anywhere.</font>

172
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I appreciate you trying to get a lay
of the land, but this ain't my first rodeo.</font>

173
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man staying in this cell is a highly
decorated officer and a trained killer.</font>

174
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:20,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been taught to adapt,
improvise.</font>

175
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">He so much as gets a hold
of a strand of floss,</font>

176
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd best believe
he'd find his way out of here.</font>

177
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:29,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, Agent Ferris,
there's no way he's getting out of here.</font>

178
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:32,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody ever has,
and nobody ever will.</font>

179
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just concerned
that he doesn't take</font>

180
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">a whole bunch of us
with him when he goes.</font>

181
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:38,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">This stuff takes time.</font>

182
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, babe, I know,
but this might be</font>

183
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:43,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">the last chance that I get
to call for a while so...</font>

184
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit, look I gotta go.</font>

185
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call you
as soon as I can, okay?</font>

186
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:55,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, love you, too, bye.</font>

187
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- How's your dad?</font>

188
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's alright.
What's going on?</font>

189
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right now, suits are here.
- What? Already?</font>

190
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Shit.</font>

191
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, who they bringing?</font>

192
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They didn't say.
- Fuck.</font>

193
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever it is, it's someone
important though.</font>

194
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never seen Langley bring
so many men before.</font>

195
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

196
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ferris is running point.</font>

197
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.
Fuck, why didn't you tell me?</font>

198
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass, relax.</font>

199
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, he probably hasn't had
a chance to look at it yet.</font>

200
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You know, just busy...
- Yeah, right, it's been weeks.</font>

201
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course he has.</font>

202
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:32,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, how do I look?</font>

203
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Desperate.
- Ha, very funny.</font>

204
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:41,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Come on.
- Let's go, come on.</font>

205
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:43,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me know when we hit
international waters.</font>

206
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, I'd like to put one
of my guys in there til he wakes up.</font>

207
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just an extra set of eyes. Don't
worry, she's still your ship.</font>

208
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:56,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where does this go?
- Bow access door, crew side.</font>

209
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only two keys can unlock it.</font>

210
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't look they visit much.</font>

211
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security measures.
Speaking of security measures...</font>

212
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here come your two.</font>

213
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're company?</font>

214
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right,
I'm Ryan, this is Taylor.</font>

215
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:12,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ferris. How we looking below?</font>

216
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interrogation room is already
prepped and set.</font>

217
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:17,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Mind if we go take a look?</font>

218
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, sir,
we haven't been briefed yet.</font>

219
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:23,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you won't be. All you need to
know is he's a high value target.</font>

220
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, but,
typically protocol...</font>

221
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">SOP went out the window the second this
man compromised national security.</font>

222
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I need from you two
is your cooperation</font>

223
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:37,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">and assistance
if and when it's needed.</font>

224
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:39,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sound good?</font>

225
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, sir.
- Good, let's go.</font>

226
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:47,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to say I'm looking
forward to working together, sir.</font>

227
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:51,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've actually put in a request
with your unit for field ops.</font>

228
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking to make the jump.</font>

229
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor.</font>

230
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, that's right, yeah.</font>

231
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:01,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm sure someone
will get back to you.</font>

232
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

233
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:48,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the captain, I've got
the con, prepare to dive.</font>

234
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wakey, wakey.</font>

235
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subject's awake.</font>

236
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:35,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a name?</font>

237
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marco.</font>

238
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Okay, I'm Scott.</font>

239
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How can I get out of here?
- You don't.</font>

240
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, unless you're
a fan of body bags.</font>

241
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

242
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:06,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you're about to meet
Weddle and Dax.</font>

243
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:09,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand back and turn around.
Step back, hands on the wall.</font>

244
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to speak to
someone in charge.</font>

245
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:13,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands on the wall, now!</font>

246
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:24,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, who is someone in...</font>

247
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dax.</font>

248
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Dax.</font>

249
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy,
it's his first day.</font>

250
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:40,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna piece of this,
too, Marco?</font>

251
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, it's been a while
since I felt a woman's touch.</font>

252
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:50,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me your pecs, baby.</font>

253
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on the move.</font>

254
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:06,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agent Ferris, please, let me
explain something to you.</font>

255
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:10,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scott Wheeler was hand-picked
into my division for a reason.</font>

256
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:17,449
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Guys like him, they have an
infinite threshold for pain.</i></font>

257
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:20,219
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And they're not just
trained for it.</i></font>

258
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,354
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They're born with it.</i></font>

259
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man was built to numb.</font>

260
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:29,861
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now a little torture
isn't gonna go anywhere.</i></font>

261
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:35,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I've been trying
to figure your angle here, Ed.</font>

262
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pulled a lot of strings
to get on board</font>

263
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:41,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">and somehow I just don't think
it's to tell me how to run my op.</font>

264
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:45,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't wanna see a good
man get rolled up. That's all.</font>

265
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he shouldn't
have changed sides.</font>

266
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allegedly changed sides.</font>

267
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're here.</font>

268
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill the feed.</font>

269
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:58,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rankin, kill it.
- Copy that.</font>

270
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna learn a thing or two?</font>

271
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:12,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go inside there
and pay close attention.</font>

272
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:14,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

273
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Patrick Ferris,
I'm a chief officer with SAD.</font>

274
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to start by making you aware
that you're an enemy combatant.</font>

275
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:27,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">And therefore have not and will
not be granted any rights.</font>

276
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:30,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how this works
so I'll keep it simple.</font>

277
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the location of the drive along
with the names of those complicit</font>

278
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">with your efforts to sell it.</font>

279
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:42,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you give me
everything you know,</font>

280
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:45,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">then maybe we can talk a deal.</font>

281
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got any ID on you?</font>

282
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:54,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- Do you have any ID?</font>

283
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

284
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have it.</font>

285
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

286
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:25,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know your guys took it
from Agent Ballard.</font>

287
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:28,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's your buyer?
- We never met him.</font>

288
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:32,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drummond was hoping
that we can draw out the leak.</font>

289
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much did they offer you?</font>

290
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not listening. Ballard
and I were assigned deep cover.</font>

291
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:44,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on my way to meet Drummond,
but someone got him first.</font>

292
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:50,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe that someone was you.</font>

293
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Agent Wheeler has begun to show
ambivalence towards his objective.</font>

294
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:58,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has failed to check-in
on three occasions now.</font>

295
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:06,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have suspicions that he is
already in contact with his buyer.</font>

296
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:10,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">and have asked Agent Ballard
to investigate further."</font>

297
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:18,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you staged
an ambush and killed her?</font>

298
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was on to you, wasn't she?</font>

299
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:24,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Someone is setting me up.
- Right.</font>

300
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:26,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you just happen to be
in possession</font>

301
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:30,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the only other device that can
access what's on that drive.</font>

302
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Convenient don't you think?</font>

303
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:34,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who tipped you off?</font>

304
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:36,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drummond was the only one
who knew.</font>

305
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:40,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know it wasn't
Drummond himself?</font>

306
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're a smart guy,
but you need to drop the act.</font>

307
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the location
and the names.</font>

308
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:51,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you
what I don't know.</font>

309
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:05,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know that there's a spot
just below the retina</font>

310
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:11,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">where the sensory nerves can channel
receptors directly to the brain?</font>

311
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:14,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, we've been doing it
wrong all these years.</font>

312
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going in through a vein
in the arm.</font>

313
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:20,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget sodium pentothal.</font>

314
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me
to tell you the truth?</font>

315
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:25,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You put a needle in his eye.</font>

316
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:29,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">This won't go anywhere.</font>

317
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's your buyer?</font>

318
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's your buyer, Scott?</font>

319
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.</font>

320
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:48,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then stop asking.
- Welcome to hell.</font>

321
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:51,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do it.
You're wasting my time.</font>

322
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godamnit. Ed!</font>

323
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,632
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get in here!</i></font>

324
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're starting to look
a little pale there, darling.</font>

325
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not exactly
how you get promoted, Cass.</font>

326
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean you're lucky Ferris
didn't see that.</font>

327
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:37,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I just need some air.</font>

328
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:40,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that guy.</font>

329
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:43,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">They brought him to the farm
when I was a recruit.</font>

330
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:44,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a legend.</font>

331
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?</font>

332
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:48,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">So nothing.
Now he's a traitor?</font>

333
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the game, Cass.</font>

334
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you can't
let it twist you.</font>

335
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:56,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, and if it does,
you can't let him see it.</font>

336
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I know.</font>

337
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's my first time
in there, too.</font>

338
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:03,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

339
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:07,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

340
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:10,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I just need to sit.
- Okay.</font>

341
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:18,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make him talk or my boys
start laying down plastic.</font>

342
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhodes.</font>

343
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:26,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

344
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have a lot of time.</font>

345
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys don't trust you,</font>

346
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't trust me,
they don't trust anybody.</font>

347
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy Ferris,
he was trained to chase facts.</font>

348
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:44,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's worse than a Doberman.</font>

349
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're gonna have to earn
some good faith right now.</font>

350
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the first thing
I taught you?</font>

351
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:53,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get caught.</font>

352
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right, but if you do,</font>

353
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to create the leverage
to keep you alive</font>

354
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:04,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">long enough to make a move.
Right?</font>

355
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you have this dongle?</font>

356
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

357
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's safe.</font>

358
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scott, I can't help you
unless you give me something.</font>

359
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I hand it over,
I will have nothing.</font>

360
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me worry about that, okay?</font>

361
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just have to buy
enough time where I can</font>

362
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">get you the heck out of here.</font>

363
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll take your guys to it.
- You know that'll never fly.</font>

364
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're on a submarine.</font>

365
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, just give me a location.</font>

366
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:49,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scott, this is your only move.</font>

367
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're gonna
put the hounds on you</font>

368
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:54,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you die or until
you make something up.</font>

369
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whichever comes first.
This is it.</font>

370
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:59,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ed, clocks ticking.</font>

371
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:00,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

372
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:03,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're assholes.</font>

373
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:08,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine, only you.
Nobody else.</font>

374
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can live with that.</font>

375
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:16,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great, you did the right thing.
Now you hang in there.</font>

376
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:19,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?</font>

377
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the drive?</font>

378
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he doesn't know,
but he said he'll</font>

379
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">take us to the location
of the second component.</font>

380
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second component?
What are you doing?</font>

381
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's not the objective.
- Well, it is now.</font>

382
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:40,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup...</font>

383
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:52,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Kingsley, you and your men
have 30 seconds</font>

384
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make
a very important decision.</font>

385
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can make you all
extremely wealthy,</font>

386
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need your assistance,
immediately.</font>

387
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">You now have 20 seconds.</font>

388
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't look surprised, Scott.</font>

389
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess,</font>

390
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">the location thing
was bullshit, huh?</font>

391
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you know?</font>

392
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you went after the only
thing Ferris didn't need.</font>

393
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good catch.</font>

394
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:31,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I was never one
for all this needle nonsense,</font>

395
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:35,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always preferred
the direct approach, okay, so...</font>

396
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingsley, times up.</font>

397
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:53,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an agreement.</font>

398
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:55,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good. I'll wire the money</font>

399
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:57,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">as soon as we get topside.</font>

400
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:00,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll negotiate an exact amount
in a few moments.</font>

401
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it?</font>

402
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it, Scott?</font>

403
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:21,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me check my bucket,
do you mind?</font>

404
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me where it is.</font>

405
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">The missions over.</font>

406
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:37,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your team's dead.
I don't wanna kill you.</font>

407
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">You fucker.</font>

408
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell me where it is.</font>

409
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:47,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gonna happen to you</font>

410
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">when your buyers find out
you fucked up, huh?</font>

411
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really wanna die over this?</font>

412
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

413
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:02,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't working.</font>

414
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:06,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut an inch off,
we'll leave him half.</font>

415
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready for round two?</font>

416
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:16,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I hope so.</font>

417
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it!</font>

418
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the enemy here.</font>

419
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:23,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interlock your hands
behind your head.</font>

420
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:25,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Are you sure you want to do this?</font>

421
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:26,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

422
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk to me.</font>

423
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

424
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:38,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

425
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:39,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

426
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor.</font>

427
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:46,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Rhodes,
do you have sights on Wheeler?</font>

428
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:49,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Ferris?</font>

429
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ferris is dead.</font>

430
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">He went rogue, he and his men
came here to assassinate Wheeler.</font>

431
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:58,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were sent to keep him alive.</font>

432
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not listen to...</font>

433
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:03,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not listen to him.</font>

434
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you with Wheeler?</font>

435
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:12,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ryan, are you with Wheeler?</font>

436
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

437
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:21,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well played, good move.</font>

438
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:25,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to turn him
over to us right now.</font>

439
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:26,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

440
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:29,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am your superior
and I'm giving you a command</font>

441
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:32,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">right now to hand Wheeler over.</font>

442
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stay you die.</font>

443
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:35,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also the man
that can give you</font>

444
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">the assignment you want
or you could be</font>

445

of your life in Somalia!</font>

00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:43,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now turn him over, now!</font>

447
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:51,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor, I'm coming out unarmed
and we will discuss this.</font>

448
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have nothing to worry about.</font>

449
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get a shot,
kill them both.</font>

450
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:03,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep Wheeler alive, you copy?
- Done.</font>

451
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming out.</font>

452
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:07,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm unarmed.</font>

453
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:15,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit. They're gone,
they're gone, get out here.</font>

454
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:20,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gone. Lock down this boat,
we have to find them right away.</font>

455
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Kingsley.
We've got an escaped subject</font>

456
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">moving through
the stern of the ship.</font>

457
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is with Agent Ryan
and Taylor.</font>

employ non-lethal force only.</i></font>

- You heard 'em, switch the mags.</font>

460
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,319

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Rankin, I need eyes!</i></font>

463
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:00,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need eyes on the monitor.</font>

464
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If you see them let me know.
- Yeah, copy that.</font>

465
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:08,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk business
and we need to talk right now.</font>

466
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the right,
go to the right.</font>

467
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:26,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go through.</font>

468
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:32,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're clear.</font>

469
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did good out there.</font>

470
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You alright?
- Yeah.</font>

471
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:47,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I need you to tell me what
the fuck is going on right now.</font>

472
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass, come on,
let's turn him in, alright.</font>

473
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:52,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This has nothing to do with us.
- It does now.</font>

474
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:56,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know you don't trust me.</font>

475
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either we do this together
or I do it alone.</font>

476
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

477
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

478
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to be nice here.</font>

479
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:17,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhodes needs me.
He doesn't need you.</font>

480
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step back.</font>

481
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:28,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're gonna tell me
where I can find a com system.</font>

482
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Control room by the bow.</font>

483
00:47:33,953 --> 00:47:35,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many guards?</font>

484
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:38,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, maybe three.</font>

485
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any weapons here?</font>

486
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

487
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:50,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, step back.</font>

488
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:16,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your turn.</font>

489
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:18,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop the guns, please.</font>

490
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:25,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo, let me make one thing clear,
okay?</font>

491
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:27,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still in our custody.</font>

492
00:48:27,206 --> 00:48:30,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do anything to fuck this up
or jeopardize this,</font>

493
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:33,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">one wrong move I swear to God
I'll fucking kill you.</font>

494
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:37,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

495
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:51,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">My men are doing a sweep.</font>

496
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:55,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And guess what, we'll find them.
- Good, good.</font>

497
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hypothetically,</font>

498
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:00,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">okay, if Wheeler needed
to contact someone topside,</font>

499
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">what exactly
would he have to do?</font>

500
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:05,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would have to
get to the control room.</font>

501
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he did,
it wouldn't even help him.</font>

502
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:13,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- At this depth, he's gotta surface or float the buoy.</font>

503
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:16,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he can't do that
without the com.</font>

504
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:18,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think Wheeler knows that?</font>

505
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:22,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he wouldn't.
But Ryan and Taylor, they would.</font>

506
00:49:25,431 --> 00:49:28,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, look, get a few men
and come with me.</font>

507
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:39,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So this was the only post they had, huh?
- What?</font>

508
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:44,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing the agency promised you
field agent after what, six months?</font>

509
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:47,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, it's been
longer than that. Right?</font>

510
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:49,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, if it's
all the same to you</font>

511
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we can do without
the small talk, okay?</font>

512
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to make sure
you know how to use that thing.</font>

513
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me, you'll be
the first to know. Come on.</font>

514
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

515
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

516
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:20,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly.</font>

517
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:27,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looks like nobody's home.
- Rankin never leaves.</font>

518
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:30,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Kingsley could of pulled
them, aid with the search.</font>

519
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:33,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, control room's
always occupied.</font>

520
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, listen, I'm going in.
- No, I'll go.</font>

521
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:40,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Watch him.
- Cass.</font>

522
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:43,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got it.
Just have my back.</font>

523
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:57,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor's alone.
No sign of subject.</font>

524
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,558
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Men,
listen up, he'll be close by.</i></font>

525
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,296
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just wait.</i></font>

526
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:33,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them if they get the shot,
take her.</font>

527
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:36,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you see her,
take the goddamn shot.</font>

528
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Got another one.
- Is it Wheeler?</font>

529
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:01,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't tell from this position.</font>

530
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her to come back.</font>

531
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass. Come back.</font>

532
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:18,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

533
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:21,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Ryan.</font>

534
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:23,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take them both.</font>

535
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:25,445
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just take them both.</i></font>

536
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down!</font>

537
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Squeeze it, hold it. Hold it.</font>

538
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't talk, don't talk.</font>

539
00:53:09,822 --> 00:53:13,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass... Get out of there, now!</font>

540
00:53:17,897 --> 00:53:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

541
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:01,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- We gotta get Ellis.</font>

542
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late!</font>

543
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get him!</font>

544
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:14,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear!</font>

545
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear.</font>

546
00:54:25,397 --> 00:54:28,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

547
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:30,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, there's not
many places they could go.</font>

548
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:34,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?
What about that access door?</font>

549
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:38,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without this, unlikely.</font>

550
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:41,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was also unlikely they were
gonna shoot up there sub.</font>

551
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:44,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir...
We have a live one.</font>

552
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Jesus.</font>

553
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, kid, it's just business.</font>

554
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

555
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:18,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

556
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:25,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">You let him fucking die!</font>

557
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:29,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, he was dead already.
- Bullshit!</font>

558
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:31,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could've lived
and you know it!</font>

559
00:55:31,029 --> 00:55:34,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a judgment call,
you had a chance, he didn't.</font>

560
00:55:34,866 --> 00:55:38,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He was dying.
- No, you just wanted to fucking even the odds!</font>

561
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:43,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I know he's your friend,
I'm sorry.</font>

562
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the job.</font>

563
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:49,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

564
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:56,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any way to radio out?</font>

565
00:55:56,656 --> 00:56:01,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we have to make it to
the com, but it's sealed off.</font>

566
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingsley's the only one
with the key.</font>

567
00:56:02,895 --> 00:56:04,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless we get the ship
to surface,</font>

568
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:09,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only way we're getting any signal
is by releasing the com's buoy.</font>

569
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:12,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">So lead me to the bow.</font>

570
00:56:12,337 --> 00:56:16,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you not hear me? Without
Kingsley, it's impossible.</font>

571
00:56:16,308 --> 00:56:19,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">There has to be an actual crew
on the other side, right?</font>

572
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:23,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Okay, then, if we cannot get to them,</font>

573
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">we make them come to us.</font>

574
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:29,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how exactly do you
plan on doing that?</font>

575
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:32,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a really bad idea.
- Do you have a better one?</font>

576
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:57,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Auxiliary and lower
engine rooms are clear.</font>

577
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, wait, you're not
seriously considering this, are you?</font>

578
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:39,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">These valves control all the
ventilation for those tanks.</font>

579
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:43,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need a trigger. Something
that will force their hand.</font>

580
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:49,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as we reach the valve before the
repair crew, we have a shot, that's it.</font>

581
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:53,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, great, and then what?
- Then, well, you be the hero.</font>

582
00:57:53,772 --> 00:57:56,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I'm still taking you in.
- Whatever.</font>

583
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much time to get
from here to that door?</font>

584
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:03,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three, four minutes tops.
But it's less for them.</font>

585
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:06,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here,
I think I have an idea.</font>

586
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the safety tanks
are meant to be full,</font>

587
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:13,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if we overclock
the negative tank,</font>

588
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:17,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we can create enough
pressure to just cause a leak.</font>

589
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:21,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the old days,
it was just red wire, blue wire.</font>

590
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:25,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, help me.</font>

591
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,848

is spiking, captain.</font>

598

I need a...</font>

is mounting fast.</font>

603
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:25,027

the emergency line.</font>

you're doing, captain?</font>

608
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:43,880

emergency line on the ballast tank.</font>

I'm sending someone over.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a damage team
down there, now.</font>

622
01:00:42,074 --> 01:00:45,976

flooding and it's filling up fast.</font>

boat, requesting damage report.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the tank?</font>

633
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got at least a foot of water!</font>

634
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:06,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you contain it?
- Sir, I think so!</font>

635
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:09,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think, officer,
just do it.</font>

636
01:04:10,915 --> 01:04:12,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check those valves!</font>

637
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:14,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start the drain pump!</font>

638
01:04:18,257 --> 01:04:22,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once this is under control,
take us to periscope depth.</font>

639
01:04:22,828 --> 01:04:28,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take an extra guy, get down to the tank
bay, and keep your eye on those squids.</font>

01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:30,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my guy?</font>

641
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:32,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You alright?</font>

642
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:34,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingsley, you have to start
listening to me, alright?</font>

643
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:38,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, Wheeler. I know the way he
thinks, I know the way he reacts.</font>

644
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he figures out a way
off this thing, it's over.</font>

645
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">He ain't getting
off of this ship.</font>

646
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've stopped him twice now.
Where's he gonna go?</font>

647
01:04:44,415 --> 01:04:47,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, it's your boat.</font>

648
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:49,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like you're starting to get
a little flush there, Rhodes.</font>

649
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:52,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't know my employer.
- Let me guess.</font>

650
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:55,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Russians, the Chinese,
maybe the Koreans.</font>

651
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does it make a difference?
- No, it doesn't.</font>

652
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as the money clears.</font>

653
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just find him.</font>

654
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

655
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:21,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, fuck.</font>

656
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:26,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect.</font>

657
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:32,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been shot before.</font>

658
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:35,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, you surprised?</font>

659
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm hoping that
you have a new plan.</font>

660
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:45,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was kind of hoping you did.</font>

661
01:05:45,076 --> 01:05:48,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, it's gonna be a little
difficult considering Rhodes seem to know</font>

662
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">every single one
of your moves before you do.</font>

663
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:53,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is he?</font>

664
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just someone I misjudged.</font>

665
01:05:56,989 --> 01:06:00,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, it's more than that.</font>

666
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:03,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm taking
a leap of faith with you.</font>

667
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:06,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to trust you,
you have to trust me.</font>

668
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:08,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

669
01:06:12,404 --> 01:06:14,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">He recruited me.</font>

670
01:06:14,105 --> 01:06:16,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent years reporting to him</font>

671
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:18,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">until he was transferred
to Intelligence.</font>

672
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:22,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time I saw him he was
talking about retirement.</font>

673
01:06:22,214 --> 01:06:24,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's on those files?</font>

674
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:28,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an algorithm detailing how
we activate our sleeper agents.</font>

675
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:33,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it falls into the hands
of the wrong people, it's over.</font>

676
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:43,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Com, we reached full pump
on negative tank!</font>

677
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:46,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flooding is slowed, we got it!</font>

678
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy, Sommer, how we looking?</font>

679
01:06:48,306 --> 01:06:52,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water pressure's normal.
And tank defaults restored.</font>

680
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:58,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radio those boys
and bring them back.</font>

681
01:06:58,616 --> 01:07:01,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">And set your course
for periscope depth.</font>

682
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, captain, setting course
for periscope depth.</font>

683
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:10,061
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What do you want me
to do about the crew?</i></font>

684
01:07:14,565 --> 01:07:16,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send them packing.</font>

685
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:18,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, copy that.</font>

686
01:07:30,014 --> 01:07:33,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like they stopped it.
What now?</font>

687
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:36,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're still out there.</font>

688
01:07:36,288 --> 01:07:38,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to level
the playing field.</font>

689
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">How, there's only two of us?</font>

690
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:46,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to change that.</font>

691
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:59,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like what he saw
when that door doesn't open.</font>

692
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:00,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

693
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you brought the rookie.</font>

694
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:12,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">How the hell did you know that?</font>

695
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:16,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one else wearing that cheap
perfume down here, sweetheart.</font>

696
01:08:16,794 --> 01:08:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a friend.</font>

697
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could use another.</font>

698
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:26,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you heard,
friends will get you killed?</font>

699
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:34,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking to get out of here. Would
be very nice to have an extra hand.</font>

700
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:40,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does she think about that?</font>

701
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:43,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that depends on what
you're really doing down here.</font>

702
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:48,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never seen you on the manifest, you're
names not on any of the official logs.</font>

703
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess the term
is ghost detainees.</font>

704
01:08:52,364 --> 01:08:55,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right,
well, my question is why.</font>

705
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:02,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just say I got a terminal
case of I know too much.</font>

706
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:07,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your people can't kill me and they
can't exactly let me go either.</font>

707
01:09:14,686 --> 01:09:19,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's KSK.
German Special Forces.</font>

708
01:09:23,462 --> 01:09:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, say we do
make it to the com</font>

709
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:31,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we get the sub back,
then what are you gonna do?</font>

710
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, "You're welcome."</font>

711
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:41,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much longer do you wanna
wait this thing out?</font>

712
01:09:41,146 --> 01:09:45,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's give 'em another sweep.
We still have a bit of time.</font>

713
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:48,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I really think that we
should consider our second option.</font>

714
01:09:48,186 --> 01:09:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's too soon.</font>

715
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:52,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">And at what point will it
be too fucking late, hmm?</font>

716
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:16,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, come on.</font>

717
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:22,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now would be good.</font>

718
01:10:23,855 --> 01:10:26,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Darrows.
Darrows, do you hear me?</font>

719
01:10:26,857 --> 01:10:29,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingsley, we're climbing.</font>

720
01:10:29,427 --> 01:10:31,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">No shit, we're climbing.
Darrows...</font>

721
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Darrows,
what are you doing?</font>

722
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kingsley, this charter
has encountered</font>

723
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's fair share
of bent shit cans.</font>

724
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I don't know what the hell
is going on back there,</font>

725
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:44,908
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but my command
supersedes your authority.</i></font>

726
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also surfacing the vessel
at the nearest port</font>

727
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:49,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">and waiting for further orders
from Langley.</font>

728
01:10:49,748 --> 01:10:52,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will do no such thing.
Stay your course, captain.</font>

729
01:10:52,484 --> 01:10:55,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'll be all, Kingsley.</font>

730
01:10:55,553 --> 01:10:58,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer of the deck, open the
locker and let's arm ourselves.</font>

731
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:02,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not taking any chances.</font>

732
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:08,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get up there.</font>

733
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:15,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly is that?</font>

734
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor just accessed
the cell door.</font>

735
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which one?</font>

736
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch,
he's grabbing Marco.</font>

737
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:24,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the fuck is Marco?</font>

738
01:11:27,352 --> 01:11:30,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we should
get you one of these.</font>

739
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:33,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I liked you.</font>

740
01:11:33,758 --> 01:11:36,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take Dax, go check it out.
I'm heading to the front.</font>

741
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, Kingsley, hold on.</font>

742
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:43,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you should go with them and
you should let me handle Darrows.</font>

743
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:46,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we should throw
everything we have at Wheeler.</font>

744
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:49,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, besides, Darrows may be
captain but I'm agency.</font>

745
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:52,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think I can persuade him.</font>

746
01:11:52,744 --> 01:11:55,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">To him you're just
a hired hand, right?</font>

747
01:11:55,713 --> 01:11:57,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, fine.</font>

748
01:12:03,788 --> 01:12:07,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the package ready.
You know what to do.</font>

749
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:11,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we really
have to move fast on this.</font>

750
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:15,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't let him off this boat.
You understand that, right?</font>

751
01:12:15,633 --> 01:12:17,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on it.</font>

752
01:12:22,273 --> 01:12:24,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weddle, you're with me.</font>

753
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:26,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dax, take the two men
down to the crew cell block.</font>

754
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:28,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Check it out.
- Got it.</font>

755
01:12:30,315 --> 01:12:32,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set rep every five minutes.</font>

756
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flash bangs coming.</font>

757
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done fucking around, boys.</font>

758
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:40,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go!</font>

759
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, they should be
closing in any minute.</font>

760
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:43,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think if we take positions
on the other end,</font>

761
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:45,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can corner them
and get a drop from behind.</font>

762
01:12:45,996 --> 01:12:47,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, you know,
I got a better idea.</font>

763
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's not gonna like it.</font>

764
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:56,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six-hundred and twenty-five
feet, captain.</font>

765
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the closest port?
- Havana.</font>

766
01:12:59,009 --> 01:13:03,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">About 45 clicks southeast.
But we're gonna need clearance.</font>

767
01:13:04,816 --> 01:13:06,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who the hell are you?</font>

768
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:08,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edward Rhodes, I'm with agency.</font>

769
01:13:10,088 --> 01:13:11,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not authorized
to be in here, agent.</font>

770
01:13:11,856 --> 01:13:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir, I'm sorry.
I take full-responsibility.</font>

771
01:13:14,692 --> 01:13:16,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize but we have
an urgent matter below</font>

772
01:13:16,895 --> 01:13:19,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you and I need to talk,
captain.</font>

773
01:13:19,664 --> 01:13:21,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, there's a radio for that.
- I understand.</font>

774
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:23,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't risk it.</font>

775
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:27,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe Kingsley
has been compromised.</font>

776
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:30,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you know broke protocol,
you know that.</font>

777
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:33,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the situation
has since worsened</font>

778
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:35,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, I could really
use your help, sir.</font>

779
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:38,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in God's name
is going on back there?</font>

780
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:42,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you know I'm not supposed
to answer that question, sir.</font>

781
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:44,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you better try.</font>

782
01:13:44,388 --> 01:13:49,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, one of the detainees on
board used to be one of ours.</font>

783
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:51,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's extremely cunning,
incredibly lethal,</font>

784
01:13:51,963 --> 01:13:56,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he has information that is
vital to our national security.</font>

785
01:13:56,368 --> 01:14:02,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he managed to escape during
interrogation and he is wandering below.</font>

786
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:05,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure,
but I think he got to Kingsley</font>

787
01:14:05,843 --> 01:14:08,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">and made some kind of deal
with him and his men.</font>

788
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:12,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, they can't truly escape
until you surface.</font>

789
01:14:12,484 --> 01:14:14,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm just asking for
a little time,</font>

790
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:18,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">hopefully my men can
neutralize this situation.</font>

791
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:23,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, please captain, can you just
maintain this depth for a short while?</font>

792
01:14:29,066 --> 01:14:32,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, Agent Rhodes.</font>

793
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:34,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm gonna verify
a few things.</font>

794
01:14:34,672 --> 01:14:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, sir.</font>

795
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:39,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Float the come buoy.</font>

796
01:14:39,878 --> 01:14:41,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, captain.</font>

797
01:14:52,423 --> 01:14:53,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the...</font>

798
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:56,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">How 'bout that?</font>

799
01:15:18,482 --> 01:15:19,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst.</font>

800
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:14,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you okay?
- Yeah.</font>

801
01:17:14,231 --> 01:17:16,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean good call on the blood.</font>

802
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:28,277
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dax, do you read?</i></font>

803
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:30,915
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dax, do you copy!</i></font>

804
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dax!</i></font>

805
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:43,626
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Taking fire, Taylor's down!</i></font>

806
01:17:43,628 --> 01:17:45,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taylor's down, incoming!</font>

807
01:17:52,337 --> 01:17:55,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We gotta get over there.
- Wait.</font>

808
01:17:55,973 --> 01:17:57,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we have eyes on Wheeler?</font>

809
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taking fire, advancing!</font>

810
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:04,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a visual,
he's down, he's hurt!</font>

811
01:18:09,219 --> 01:18:10,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, hi, asshole.</font>

812
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:14,191
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fuck you.</i></font>

813
01:18:20,664 --> 01:18:23,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the prisoner?</font>

814
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:25,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">No longer an issue.</font>

815
01:18:26,904 --> 01:18:29,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get 'em up to the mess hall.
Good work, men.</font>

816
01:18:29,874 --> 01:18:31,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should we
call it in to Rhodes?</font>

817
01:18:31,342 --> 01:18:35,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I don't trust
that son of a bitch.</font>

818
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:37,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to talk to Wheeler first.</font>

819
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.</font>

820
01:18:44,288 --> 01:18:47,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, your story checks out.
- Yes, sir.</font>

821
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:50,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're still being ordered
to dock in Havana.</font>

822
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:53,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extraction team
is already en route.</font>

823
01:18:54,065 --> 01:18:55,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just bought yourself
some time.</font>

824
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, captain, thank you.</font>

825
01:19:18,388 --> 01:19:20,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look nervous.</font>

826
01:19:20,324 --> 01:19:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not?
- I never saw the point.</font>

827
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:27,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">And usually I shoot the other
guy before he shoots me.</font>

828
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

829
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let's do this.</font>

830
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:32,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wheeler...</font>

831
01:20:32,096 --> 01:20:35,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you could
finally join us.</font>

832
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:40,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought perhaps you and I could
talk before getting Agent Rhodes.</font>

833
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:44,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not here?
- No, he is not.</font>

834
01:20:46,477 --> 01:20:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then this should be
over quickly.</font>

835
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:02,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna
cut you in on a deal,</font>

836
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:05,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I was gonna
cut you in on a deal.</font>

837
01:21:07,397 --> 01:21:09,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Rhodes?</font>

838
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:12,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you.</font>

839
01:21:21,212 --> 01:21:24,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's somewhere upfront
playing bureaucrat.</font>

840
01:21:24,382 --> 01:21:27,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many of your guys
are with him?</font>

841
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:30,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">One guy. That's it.</font>

842
01:21:32,123 --> 01:21:33,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want to do with him?</font>

843
01:21:42,933 --> 01:21:45,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't, don't...
please don't kill me.</font>

844
01:21:45,169 --> 01:21:47,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna kill you,
Kingsley.</font>

845
01:21:47,338 --> 01:21:51,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can imagine he has a few words
he'd like to say to you.</font>

846
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:56,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's all yours.</font>

847
01:21:56,947 --> 01:22:00,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure?
- Yeah.</font>

848
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess this is the part where I'm
supposed to tell you that I owe you one.</font>

849
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:07,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty sure, yeah.</font>

850
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:10,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good luck.
- Try not to have too much fun.</font>

851
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry...</font>

852
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know exactly
what to do with him.</font>

853
01:22:17,535 --> 01:22:21,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ETA 11 minutes, sir.
- Copy.</font>

854
01:22:21,004 --> 01:22:24,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Echo one, we're 11 minutes out.</font>

855
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:27,945
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Requesting docking coordinates.</i></font>

856
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:41,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that.</font>

857
01:23:01,678 --> 01:23:03,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready?
- Yeah.</font>

858
01:23:15,092 --> 01:23:18,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.</font>

859
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:19,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aye, captain.</font>

860
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not looking good.</font>

861
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:27,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-uh, keep them up.</font>

862
01:23:31,475 --> 01:23:34,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell is this?
- Jesus Christ.</font>

863
01:23:34,978 --> 01:23:36,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain,
my name is Cassie Taylor.</font>

864
01:23:36,614 --> 01:23:38,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an agent on board.</font>

865
01:23:38,648 --> 01:23:40,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever this guy's saying
is a complete lie.</font>

866
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:44,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Unbelievable.
- He's operating without clearance.</font>

867
01:23:44,288 --> 01:23:46,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's killed half of our men,
including my partner.</font>

868
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cannot trust him.</font>

869
01:23:49,627 --> 01:23:52,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that him?
- That's correct, captain.</font>

870
01:23:52,329 --> 01:23:56,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can prove everything.
All I need is a line out.</font>

871
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just two minutes,
you can monitor the whole thing.</font>

872
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta be joking.</font>

873
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:03,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do all you company men
rehearse the same way?</font>

874
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:05,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">He already got that deal.</font>

875
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:08,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And guess what?
It panned out.</font>

876
01:24:10,647 --> 01:24:12,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's your guy?</font>

877
01:24:13,351 --> 01:24:15,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Wheeler,
stop the charade.</font>

878
01:24:15,218 --> 01:24:17,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know you murdered
everyone on the boat.</font>

879
01:24:17,187 --> 01:24:19,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wheeler, look,
they set the course to dock.</font>

880
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:37,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, you can take my gun.</font>

881
01:24:37,273 --> 01:24:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can wait until
the team arrive.</font>

882
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:42,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain,
this man is extremely lethal.</font>

883
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:44,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things could get out of hand
really quickly.</font>

884
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:48,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you command your men to
make a move right now, captain.</font>

885
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:49,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, take it.</font>

886
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:50,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, think about it.</font>

887
01:24:50,754 --> 01:24:52,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything
he was saying was true,</font>

888
01:24:52,556 --> 01:24:54,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't be willing
to hold out with you.</font>

889
01:24:54,124 --> 01:24:55,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, don't listen to them.</font>

890
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:56,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, they're playing you.</font>

891
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly
what we train them to do.</font>

892
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:01,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have your men move, now!</font>

893
01:25:02,532 --> 01:25:04,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've heard enough.</font>

894
01:25:04,535 --> 01:25:09,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a good goddamn which
one of you is spinning the yarn.</font>

895
01:25:09,139 --> 01:25:13,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I think I'll let
Langley decide.</font>

896
01:25:13,076 --> 01:25:19,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, Agent Rhodes, I
think I'm gonna have to take that.</font>

897
01:25:21,352 --> 01:25:23,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, just take it.</font>

898
01:25:24,722 --> 01:25:29,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the chase, back off,
back off! Now, back off!</font>

899
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:33,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody don't move! I'll put a
bullet in his head, I swear to God.</font>

900
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:37,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, everybody stay calm.
We're all gonna stay alive.</font>

901
01:25:37,168 --> 01:25:38,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, this is
what you're gonna do.</font>

902
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:40,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna command your men</font>

903
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">to alter the coordinates
to surface</font>

904
01:25:42,306 --> 01:25:44,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the port
as close to land as possible.</font>

905
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:47,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like hell I will.
- Okay, I understand.</font>

906
01:25:50,548 --> 01:25:51,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godamnit!</font>

907
01:25:51,648 --> 01:25:53,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Issue the order right now</font>

908
01:25:53,584 --> 01:25:56,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I will shoot you
and I will shoot your men!</font>

909
01:25:56,587 --> 01:25:58,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Issue the order!
Do it!</font>

910
01:25:58,588 --> 01:26:00,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it up!</font>

911
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:08,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Command your men to drop their sidearms
to the floor and kick them over.</font>

912
01:26:08,766 --> 01:26:10,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them, now.</font>

913
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:13,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sinclair, lower your side arm.</font>

914
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, nice and easy.</font>

915
01:26:15,472 --> 01:26:17,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your sidearms.
Drop 'em now!</font>

916
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:21,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ground!
Drop 'em on the ground!</font>

917
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:23,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back the fuck up, Scott!</font>

918
01:26:23,246 --> 01:26:25,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll blow your fucking head off!</font>

919
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick your guns over here,
both of them.</font>

920
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kick the fucking gun over here!</font>

921
01:26:31,321 --> 01:26:33,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good.</font>

922
01:26:33,223 --> 01:26:35,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass, drop your weapon.</font>

923
01:26:35,459 --> 01:26:38,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go fuck yourself.
- Really?</font>

924
01:26:38,129 --> 01:26:43,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well,
maybe he'll help you out.</font>

925
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:45,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fuck.
- Put the gun...</font>

926
01:26:45,535 --> 01:26:48,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down
on the fucking table.</font>

927
01:26:51,775 --> 01:26:55,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too bad, Wheeler. She would've
made an incredible partner.</font>

928
01:26:55,411 --> 01:26:57,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's loyal right to the end.</font>

929
01:26:59,182 --> 01:27:00,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to pick them.</font>

930
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:03,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.
Agent Ballard!</font>

931
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:13,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Scott.</font>

932
01:27:16,834 --> 01:27:18,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you die.</font>

933
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:23,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what
I wanted you to see.</font>

934
01:27:50,234 --> 01:27:52,536
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Rhodes knew we were on it
from the word go.</i></font>

935
01:27:53,971 --> 01:27:55,639
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's why he cut me in.</i></font>

936
01:28:11,888 --> 01:28:14,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't beat yourself up
about it, Scott.</font>

937
01:28:14,525 --> 01:28:16,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both did our job.</font>

938
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just did mine
a little bit better.</font>

939
01:28:25,803 --> 01:28:28,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Put it down.</font>

940
01:28:33,343 --> 01:28:34,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hand it over.</font>

941
01:28:46,723 --> 01:28:49,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You get it?
- Not exactly.</font>

942
01:28:49,759 --> 01:28:51,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's more than enough
to split three ways.</font>

943
01:28:51,829 --> 01:28:53,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to cut our losses
and move now.</font>

944
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I didn't agree to that.
- We don't have a choice.</font>

945
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">The deal was they were gonna wire the
money once we gave them the second piece.</font>

946
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:04,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we don't have it. So it's
still a win, don't be greedy.</font>

947
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greed is the reason we're here.</font>

948
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:21,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take him with us.</font>

949
01:29:21,959 --> 01:29:23,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get him to talk.</font>

950
01:29:23,794 --> 01:29:26,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too risky, just let it go.</font>

951
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:37,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ. You, you.</font>

952
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:40,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer that phone,
put it on speaker.</font>

953
01:29:48,686 --> 01:29:51,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Captain Darrows.</font>

954
01:29:51,321 --> 01:29:54,655
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Copy that.
Darrows, echo, zero, five.</i></font>

955
01:29:54,657 --> 01:29:58,295
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're about two mikes out,
do you copy?</i></font>

956
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:04,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Affirmative.
Coordinates are locked in.</font>

957
01:30:06,837 --> 01:30:08,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see them now.</font>

958
01:30:08,938 --> 01:30:11,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Good, as soon as you land
disengage your forward hatch</i></font>

959
01:30:11,508 --> 01:30:13,007
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so my man can board.</i></font>

960
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:15,344
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We want this to be
easy sledding.</i></font>

961
01:30:15,346 --> 01:30:17,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understood, over.</font>

962
01:30:17,714 --> 01:30:19,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down.</font>

963
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:51,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

964
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:57,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him to unlock
the forward hatch.</font>

965
01:31:05,462 --> 01:31:10,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, amuse me,
was any of it real?</font>

966
01:31:12,669 --> 01:31:14,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sex wasn't bad.</font>

967
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess she'll never find out.</font>

968
01:31:18,441 --> 01:31:21,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, you've only
been dead for two days.</font>

969
01:31:22,945 --> 01:31:24,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look,
it's nothing personal, Scott,</font>

970
01:31:24,548 --> 01:31:26,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it would take two lifetimes</font>

971
01:31:26,717 --> 01:31:28,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make this kinda cash
chasing guys</font>

972
01:31:28,419 --> 01:31:30,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">we both know
get replaced on a dime.</font>

973
01:31:30,887 --> 01:31:33,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can't beat them,
join them.</font>

974
01:31:33,523 --> 01:31:34,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

975
01:31:40,664 --> 01:31:42,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy.</font>

976
01:31:45,803 --> 01:31:47,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

977
01:31:52,176 --> 01:31:54,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go, Mel.</font>

978
01:31:57,548 --> 01:32:00,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna get caught. You
think offsetting the coordinates</font>

979
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:03,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a couple
miles is gonna change anything?</font>

980
01:32:03,587 --> 01:32:07,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's bound to see you trying to
make it to shore. You'll be fugitives.</font>

981
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:11,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Thanks.
Are you finished?</font>

982
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. You can kill her.</font>

983
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:17,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait! Wait.</font>

984
01:32:17,734 --> 01:32:19,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will tell you
where it is okay?</font>

985
01:32:19,902 --> 01:32:24,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want the dongle,
let her go, it's yours.</font>

986
01:32:27,044 --> 01:32:29,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is it?</font>

987
01:32:29,213 --> 01:32:33,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a safe deposit box, okay?</font>

988
01:32:33,249 --> 01:32:36,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's lying, let's go.
- Yeah, well, what if he isn't?</font>

989
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be a fool.</font>

990
01:32:38,688 --> 01:32:40,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made
a small fortune already.</font>

991
01:32:40,523 --> 01:32:42,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we're talking about
millions here.</font>

992
01:32:42,124 --> 01:32:46,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey, Ballard.
Watch yourself.</font>

993
01:32:48,798 --> 01:32:50,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the location, Scott.</font>

994
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:55,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me your word she lives.
- God damn it, let's go!</font>

995
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:05,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have my word.</font>

996
01:33:05,516 --> 01:33:07,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck this, you're dead!</font>

997
01:33:35,846 --> 01:33:36,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wheeler!</font>

998
01:34:08,245 --> 01:34:10,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pain in my ass, you!</font>

999
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her!</font>

1000
01:34:16,186 --> 01:34:18,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it, Ballard, shoot her!</font>

1001
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:23,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her, Ballard, shoot her!</font>

1002
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:27,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

1003
01:34:29,766 --> 01:34:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shoot her! Ballard!</font>

1004
01:34:37,374 --> 01:34:40,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bitch! Bitch!</font>

1005
01:34:48,317 --> 01:34:51,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wheeler!
- Yeah, you gotta get to Ballard.</font>

1006
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:55,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus Christ, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

1007
01:34:55,325 --> 01:34:57,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We got to go, come on.
- Are you sure?</font>

1008
01:35:18,848 --> 01:35:20,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way!</font>

1009
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:39,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the ground!
On the ground, now!</font>

1010
01:35:42,304 --> 01:35:44,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm deputy, don't shoot!</font>

1011
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have an escaped target!</font>

1012
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just ran out of here,
you need to find her!</font>

1013
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:51,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hands behind your back!
- He's been shot, he needs help!</font>

1014
01:36:17,441 --> 01:36:20,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're ready for you.
- Okay, great, thank you.</font>

1015
01:36:26,316 --> 01:36:28,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agent Taylor, sir.</font>

1016
01:36:28,884 --> 01:36:30,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1017
01:36:32,088 --> 01:36:33,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello.
- Agent Taylor.</font>

1018
01:36:33,423 --> 01:36:34,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Please, have a seat.</font>

1019
01:36:34,924 --> 01:36:36,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hi.</font>

1020
01:36:40,362 --> 01:36:42,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you'd like to say
before we start?</font>

1021
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:46,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir.
- Good.</font>

1022
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:49,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've looked over your report
and it seems to fall in line</font>

1023
01:36:49,106 --> 01:36:51,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">with Agent Wheeler's statement.</font>

1024
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:53,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'd be remiss
if I didn't say</font>

1025
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:56,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">his vindication was in part
due to your testimony.</font>

1026
01:36:56,812 --> 01:37:00,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, having said that...</font>

1027
01:37:02,753 --> 01:37:07,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is one of the biggest fuck
ups to ever come across my desk.</font>

1028
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:12,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">The panel can't open an inquiry
because the Black Site doesn't exist.</font>

1029
01:37:12,129 --> 01:37:14,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can't label
the source of the leak</font>

1030
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:15,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">because that would mean
admitting to a failure</font>

1031
01:37:15,932 --> 01:37:18,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we weren't prepared for.</font>

1032
01:37:18,468 --> 01:37:22,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got six dead agents,
three civilians,</font>

1033
01:37:22,105 --> 01:37:26,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an oversight committee
breathing down my neck.</font>

1034
01:37:28,277 --> 01:37:30,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew Tom Drummond.</font>

1035
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:33,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a good agent
and one smart son of a bitch.</font>

1036
01:37:33,282 --> 01:37:35,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the second he got autonomy
to run that division</font>

1037
01:37:35,986 --> 01:37:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">was the second that we had
to start answering for it.</font>

1038
01:37:39,121 --> 01:37:41,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand?</font>

1039
01:37:41,924 --> 01:37:43,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

1040
01:37:44,294 --> 01:37:46,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for Agent Ballard...</font>

1041
01:37:55,137 --> 01:37:58,475
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We've been trying to track her movements
since she disappeared in Cuba.</i></font>

1042
01:38:00,477 --> 01:38:05,546
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Interpol tracked her to down
to some bodega in Caracas,</i></font>

1043
01:38:05,548 --> 01:38:09,386
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>while another dead end led us
to a safe house in Peru.</i></font>

1044
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:19,096
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wherever she is,
she's being careful.</i></font>

1045
01:38:30,106 --> 01:38:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now, if there's anything good
to come out of this,</i></font>

1046
01:38:33,442 --> 01:38:35,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the fact that
we were able to recover</font>

1047
01:38:35,178 --> 01:38:37,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">a terabyte of data
from an encrypted server</font>

1048
01:38:37,547 --> 01:38:39,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Rhodes was accessing.</font>

1049
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">This should help us locate
and identify his buyer.</font>

1050
01:38:43,352 --> 01:38:47,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to be part
of the team that takes him down?</font>

1051
01:38:49,325 --> 01:38:52,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course, sir.</font>

1052
01:38:52,495 --> 01:38:54,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Good.</font>

1053
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:58,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you won't have any issue
with your new partner?</font>

1054
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1055
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:06,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then that's all for now.</font>

1056
01:39:06,575 --> 01:39:07,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1057
01:39:10,446 --> 01:39:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Agent Taylor, one
more thing before you go.</font>

1058
01:39:14,351 --> 01:39:18,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">When our team went in to sweep the
site they took log of the detainees.</font>

1059
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:22,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of them have been
accounted for except one.</font>

1060
01:39:22,092 --> 01:39:24,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">A German.</font>

1061
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:27,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they located his cell
they found Kingsley naked.</font>

1062
01:39:27,297 --> 01:39:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tied to a toilet
with three of his guards.</font>

1063
01:39:32,002 --> 01:39:36,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch insisted
he was being coerced.</font>

1064
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know anything about that?</font>

1065
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:41,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say that I do.</font>

1066
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:44,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm-hm.
- Thank you.</font>

1067
01:39:50,152 --> 01:39:52,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did he call yet?
- No, not yet.</font>

1068
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:54,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hm.</font>

1069
01:39:59,329 --> 01:40:01,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

1070
01:40:01,597 --> 01:40:02,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off.</font>

1071
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:18,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1072
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:22,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider us even, friend.</font>

1073
01:40:22,451 --> 01:40:25,319
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Stay out of trouble.</i></font>

1074
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:26,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You too.</font>

1075
01:40:32,594 --> 01:40:37,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Special Agent Taylor.
Has a nice ring to it.</font>

1076
01:40:37,267 --> 01:40:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It does, doesn't it?</font>

1077
01:40:39,201 --> 01:40:41,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me something,</font>

1078
01:40:41,637 --> 01:40:43,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">where did you really
hide the dongle?</font>

1079
01:40:43,706 --> 01:40:48,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Exactly where I said.
- In a safe deposit box?</font>

1080
01:40:50,213 --> 01:40:52,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you actually
stopped at a bank?</font>

1081
01:40:52,615 --> 01:40:55,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got an account and everything.</font>

1082
01:40:55,151 --> 01:40:58,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate to break it to you
but you know that spy stuff?</font>

1083
01:40:58,053 --> 01:41:00,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not so exciting.</font>

1084
01:41:00,056 --> 01:41:02,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1085
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:04,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- I swear.</font>

1086
01:41:04,526 --> 01:41:06,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of the time
you stay in a shitty motel.</font>

1087
01:41:06,663 --> 01:41:10,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shitty bed.
Hopefully, no shitty breakfast.</font>

1088
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:14,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I forgot you got shot.</font>

1089
01:41:14,437 --> 01:41:17,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Huh?
- How's he doing?</font>
